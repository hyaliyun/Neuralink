The latest YouTube challenge involves people intentionally setting themselves on fire. It’s called “The Fire Challenge” and young people across the country are taking it in droves, CBS2’s Elise Finch reported. They pour flammable liquid on their body then set themselves on fire, just for fun. “It’s a little too dangerous just for a YouTube video,” Ace Dawson, an Ozone Park resident, said. On Tuesday night, a 12-year-old in Queens was rushed to the hospital after mimicking the fire challenge in his Far Rockaway home. According to police, the boy doused himself with rubbing alcohol and used a lighter to set himself on fire. Moments later he ran outside with his upper body still burning and neighbors extinguished the flames. “I came out and I saw the police car, the fire truck, and the place blocked off with the yellow tape,” neighbor Beverly Robinson said. Police said the boy has third-degree burns on over 40 percent of his body. Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency room physician at Lennox Hill Hospital, said it can take years to recover from the damage done in just seconds. “The burns penetrate the skin and soft tissue and then involve the muscle. As they penetrate you lose fluid, causing dehydration and it causes all these inflammatory markers that drop your blood pressure and can put you into shock.,” Glatter said. One teen said some of his classmates have taken the fire challenge to get attention. “I’m just convinced that it’s a lot of dumb teenagers looking to be famous on the Internet,” Cody Davido said. “Just to be on YouTube, really? It’s sad that this is what it’s come to now that social media has pushed kids to this limit where they have to do something as stupid as that just to get some recognition,” Jamaica resident Frank Gines said. Health care professionals suggest parents talk to their children and tell them this is one challenge they should never accept. In addition to severe burns the challenge can lead to infections or even death. ||||| The 12-year-old boy who set himself on fire inside a Queens home as part of a moronic social media stunt initially told first responders the injury was caused by an oven, according to a source.

FDNY firefighters turn out their own 'Running Man' video But the injuries are not thought to be life-threatening, cops said. The crazy trend appears to have started in 2013. There are hundreds of videos online of people performing the dangerous stunt to various degrees of injury. It appears that the point of the challenge is to spray a small amount of flammable liquid like alcohol or perfume on an area of the body and light it on fire for a few moments. But in multiple YouTube videos, many of the participants, who appear to be teenagers or younger, struggle to douse the fire fast enough.

A watchdog group critical of pork barrel spending released its latest findings Wednesday targeting the top Congressional \\"porkers.\\" Some of the pork projects, according to the group, include a Lobster Institute; the Rocky Flats, Colorado, Cold War Museum; and the First Tee, a program to build young people's character through golf. Members of Congress requested funds for all these pet projects and thousands of others last year, according to the latest copy of the annual \\"Pig Book\\" released by Citizens Against Government Waste. \\"Congress stuffed 11,610 projects\\" worth 17.2 billion into a dozen spending bills, the group said in the report released Wednesday. The \\"Pig Book\\" names dozens of what the citizens group considers the most egregious porkers, the lawmakers who funnel money to projects on their home turf. Interactive: Pork barrel spending ». Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, requested the most money, 892.2 million, according to the group. In a statement to CNN, Cochran said he doesn't \\"accept the premise\\" of the group's claim that \\"any and all federal spending not specifically requested by the Executive Branch is wasteful and irresponsible.\\" \\"The Congress is vested with the power to appropriate funds to be spent by the federal government by the U. S. Constitution. We will continue to carry out that responsibility with care and a commitment to serve the public interest,\\" he said. \\"There were several candidates for the Narcissist Award,\\" Tom Schatz, the president of the group said. Read the group's 2008 report. \\"But this one went to House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel for the Charles Rangel Public Service Center at the City College of New York -- 1,950,000 [for a project] that he named after himself.\\" Rangel, a Democrat from New York, said last summer he was \\"honored that City College chose to have my name attached to what is an important project, not just for the residents of my congressional district, but for New York City and this nation.\\" Some lawmakers defended their earmarks, such as Rep. Mike Thompson, D-California, who channeled 742,764 to olive fruit fly research. \\"The olive fruit fly has infested thousands of California olive groves and is the single largest threat to the U.S. olive and olive oil industries,\\" he said. Schatz responded that his organization is criticizing the way lawmakers direct money to specific projects, not the projects themselves. \\"There are existing programs for virtually everything in the 'Pig Book.' If members [of Congress] believe they should be given additional funding, give them to the agencies rather than to specific projects,\\" he said. The problem with earmarks, he said, is that \\"we don't know if [the projects] are valuable or not.\\" Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-South Carolina, the third ranking Democrat in the House, defended his earmark for a program that funds a youth golf program for children on U.S. military bases. \\"It's a character building program, that seems to be working well for low income kids and that's why we do it throughout the United States of America. I just feel that children living on military installations ought to have this program as well,\\" Clyburn told CNN. Clyburn also defended the practice of earmarking federal funds. \\"I can name earmark after earmark, there's absolutely nothing wrong with congresspeople responding to their constituents and funding programs that they feel are necessary to improve the quality of life of the people who live in their districts.\\" Clyburn also raised questions about the group releasing the \\"Pig Book\\" saying, \\"they're not telling the truth about this earmark no more than them telling the truth about where they get their money from. The committee against government waste isn't against government waste.\\" He cited press reports from the St. Petersburg Times that the Committee Against Government Waste received money from the tobacco industry and other private groups to lobby Congress. Both parties came in for criticism, with the Democrats, who control both houses of Congress, topping the Republicans in spending. The Democrats were behind 5,199 projects worth 5.5 billion, while the Republicans earmarked 3,408 projects worth 4.4 billion, the citizen's group said. And in a sign bipartisanship is not dead, the two parties jointly backed 2,518 projects worth 3.8 billion. Interactive: Map of pork per capita by state ». The three senators running for president were not among the top targets of criticism, and one got an entirely clean bill from the watchdog group. \\"Sen. [Barack] Obama had 53 earmarks worth 97 million dollars, and Sen. [Hillary] Clinton had 281 earmarks worth 296 million. Sen. Obama recently said he would not request any project for this upcoming fiscal year,\\" said Tom Schatz, the president of Citizens Against Government Waste. \\"And of course Sen. [John] McCain has never requested them and he won't be doing so in 2009. So now the question is if Sen. Clinton will join the other major candidates in saying that she will not request any earmarks for 2009.\\" To qualify for the Pig Book, a project must meet at least one of these standards: it was requested by only one chamber of Congress; was not specifically authorized; was not competitively awarded; was not requested by the president; greatly exceeded the president's budget request or the previous year's funding; was not the subject of congressional hearings; or served only a local or special interests.

In order to achieve this goal, the UNFPA works in numerous ways, including: 1. Advocacy: The UNFPA works with governments, policymakers, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to promote policies and programs that prioritize sexual and reproductive health and rights, as well as gender equality. This advocacy includes addressing the importance of family planning, comprehensive sexuality education, and access to safe and affordable contraceptives. 2. Family planning: The UNFPA supports the provision of high-quality, affordable, and widely accessible family planning services and information. This includes distributing contraceptives, training healthcare providers, and supporting national family planning initiatives. 3. Comprehensive sexuality education: The UNFPA believes that educating young people about their sexual and reproductive health can help them make informed decisions about their bodies and relationships, and ultimately contribute to preventing unintended pregnancies. To this end, the organization supports the development and implementation of comprehensive sexuality education programs in schools and communities worldwide. 4. Supporting women's reproductive rights: The UNFPA also works to ensure that women have the necessary resources and support to make informed decisions about their reproductive lives. This includes access to safe abortion services where it is legal, as well as post-abortion care and counseling. 5. Addressing cultural, social, and gender barriers: Recognizing that deep-rooted beliefs and cultural norms can often contribute to unwanted pregnancies, the UNFPA works with local communities to address these barriers and promote gender equality. In conclusion, the statement provided from the UNFPA answers the question \\"One of UNFPA's goals is to make all pregnancies what?\\" by highlighting the organization's commitment to making all pregnancies \\"wanted.\\" The UNFPA achieves this through various approaches and initiatives such as policy advocacy, family planning, sexuality education, women's reproductive rights support, and addressing cultural and social barriers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will need 16 15-foot (4.5-meter) ash saplings that are about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) thick for the frame. You will also need at least 12 ash or basswood saplings that are 15 feet (4.5 meters) tall and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick for the horizontal hoops. The saplings need to be straight as possible. Ash and basswood are the most traditional, but you can use other hardwoods, such as: cedar, chestnut, elm, or hickory. If you are making a model, use thin, bendy twigs instead. You can also use wire instead. Florist's wire coated in brown paper would work well. Start by trimming off any bark and branches. This will help reduce wood rot and help the wigwam last longer. Next, cut the ends of the saplings into points. This will make it easier to insert them into the holes. Make your poles extra-strong by hardening the pointy ends in a fire. This will also help them last longer once you drive them into the soil. If the saplings aren't flexible enough, soak them in a lake or river for at least two days first. Be sure to tie them down so that they don't float away. Gather 50 bushels of cattail leaves. A bushel is a bundle that is thick enough to wrap your arms around. Separate the cattails into 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) thick bundles. Secure each bundle at one end with some string. Set them out in the sun to dry. If you don't have access to cattails, you can use heavy canvas, which was used to cover wigwams from the late 1700s onwards. You will need 12 to 14 sheets that are 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.5 meters). If you want to be more traditional, you can sew cattail leaves into large mats. Plan on using 12 to 14 mats, each 5 by 10 feet (1.5 by 3.5 meters). If you are making a model, you could use pieces of grass, raffia, or straw instead. You can also use pieces of cotton, linen, or canvas fabric. Gather 7 to 10 sheets of birch bark, about 3 feet (cc meter) square. Use a hot nail or wood burner to make holes along the top edge of each birch bark sheet. You can also use elm bark, or weave mats out of cattails. If you are making a model, you can use white paper instead. For a more realistic effect, go over it lightly in a dry brush dipped in brown paint to make the streaks.

Dennis Davis was an American drummer and percussionist who had a significant contribution to several of Bowie's albums during the 1970s and 1980s, including \\"Young Americans\\" (1975), \\"Station to Station\\" (1976), \\"Low\\" (1977), \\"Heroes\\" (1977), \\"Lodger\\" (1979), and \\"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\\" (1980). \\"Fame\\" was released in 1975 and is the fifth track on David Bowie's ninth studio album, \\"Young Americans.\\" The song was written by Bowie, John Lennon, and guitarist Carlos Alomar. The collaboration with John Lennon happened when he visited Bowie during the recording sessions in New York. They improvised and reworked a song called \\"Footstompin'\\" of which the guitar riff by Carlos Alomar became the central part of \\"Fame.\\" Interestingly, \\"Fame\\" became Bowie's first single to reach the number one spot on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Dennis Davis was introduced to David Bowie by his former bandmate Tony Visconti. Visconti, a record producer and musician, had worked with Davis in the band \\"Roy Harper,\\" and later on, he joined Bowie's band and started playing on his albums. The drummer's unique and versatile style made it possible for him to cover a wide range of genres from rock and funk to experimental and electronic music, which is evident on Bowie's albums that Davis worked on. Davis' drumming on \\"Fame\\" was exceptional. His tight, precise playing laid the groundwork for the song's funk-infused rhythms, creating an infectious groove that propels the entire track. His ability to explore different time signatures and embody the musical changes within Bowie's compositions enhanced the overall listening experience, making him a valuable addition to Bowie's recording sessions. Apart from working with David Bowie, Dennis Davis also collaborated with other notable artists, such as Stevie Wonder, George Benson, Roy Ayers, and Iggy Pop. Throughout his career, he managed to leave his mark on various genres, excelling in both live and studio performances. In summary, Dennis Davis played drums on \\"Fame\\" by David Bowie, producing an iconic groove that complemented Bowie's work and helped propel the song to the top of the charts. Davis' versatile drumming style made him a go-to choice not only for Bowie but also for many acclaimed artists in the music industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sam confides in both his protective older brother Rocky and his budding girlfriend, Millie, who urges Sam to take a higher road.Sam's older brother Rocky confides in his friends, Clyde and Marty, who are also familiar with George's reputation as a bully (he previously mocked Clyde for having two gay dads). While they agree that they need to stand up for Sam, they have different approaches. Clyde, who is sensitive and a bit of an outsider himself within the group, is more sympathetic and passive. Marty, who has issues with anger and trauma stemming from his father's suicide, his mother's apathy and his older brother's abuse, favors a more righteous form of revenge.Eventually, they hatch a plan with Sam to invite George on a fake birthday party for Sam, which George all-too eagerly accepts. They plan to drive to a local creek where they will spend the afternoon on a boat and, in an orchestrated game of Truth or Dare, get George to strip his clothes and jump in the lake, leading him to hitch a ride home in the nude.When the gang consisting of Sam, Rocky, Marty, Clyde and Millie (who is not yet aware of the plan) arrive at George's house, he is working on his video diary for the day. He leaves without telling his mother where he will be, and gives Sam a present a large, high-end water gun. They run into Marty's obnoxious older brother at a convenience store on the way.Throughout the drive and the journey to the boat it becomes clear that George, while annoying and occasionally harsh, is truly desperate to fit in and resorts to aggression as a cover-up. He also admits to having a learning disability, which he hopes to be accepted for. En route to the boat, Sam tells Millie about the plan.

People thought that poetry was the new rock 'n' roll. However, despite the brief popularity of a few pop poets, poetry and pop music didn't seem to mix. But are they really so different? If you look back at the origins of poetry, there is a strong connection between poems and popular music. In Greek mythology, for example, the muse Erato is pictured with a lyre in her hand, and looks just like the ancestor of the modern rock star with his electric guitar. In addition, the poets Shelley and Byron were as famous in the nineteenth century as the pop stars of today. But despite their common origins, there are many differences between poetry and pop music. Pop songs are always written for a public performance, whereas poetry often isn't. And the lyrics in pop songs sometimes have less rhythm than those in poetry. This is because the music provides the rhythm rather than the words. Pop lyrics are also simpler and often keep on saying the same thing. This repetition works well in a performance and means that pop songs are easier for people to sing and learn by heart. Both songs and poems tell a story or talk about feelings. Songs in particular deal with the different stages in a relationship, such as falling in love or breaking up. The words and ideas in songs are usually easier to understand than those in \\"serious\\" poetry. However, talented performers like Paul McCartney, or newer stars like Robbe Williams, often give simple songs more expression when they perform them. And some of the best lines from pop lyrics are as beautiful as poetry. So although pop music and poetry have many differences, they do have one important thing in common: the power to make us think about how we feel. Question: According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that _ . Options: A: there is more rhythm in pop songs than poetry B: pop songs are more difficult to understand than poetry C: some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again D: pop songs are not always performed before audience","completion":"According to the article, the difference between poetry and pop songs is that C: some words in pop songs are repeated over and over again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After investigating the most recent murder, Kronos and the Professor stop at an inn along the way where a wiseass named Kerro [Ian Hendry] insults the hunchbacked professor and draws a sword on Kronos. In lightning speed, Kronos shows his skill with the sword (NOTE: cool scene).Meanwhile, Dr Marcus goes to visit the Durward mansion where brother Paul [Shane Briant] and sister Sara [Lois Daine] live with Lady Durward [Wanda Ventham], their grieving mother who has been brooding since the death of her husband from a disease once treated by Dr Marcus. Riding away from the Durward mansion, Marcus meets up with a cloaked figure. Shortly thereafter, Marcus begins to turn vampire. Kronos tries to kill Marcus by staking and then hanging.

Thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes in Munich as experts today tried to defuse a 550lb Allied bomb dropped on the city during WW2. The undetonated explosive was found beneath ground at the site of the former Schwabinger 7 nightclub, a hangout of the Rolling Stones in the 1970s. Bomb disposal teams fear its complex chemical fuse could trigger a repeat of the 2010 tragedy when three experts were killed in a blast in another German city. Scroll down for video. Deadly: Bomb disposal expert Diethard Posorski next to the 550lb bomb discovered in Munich. Close up: The bomb, which was dropped by either American and British planes in either 1944 or 1945. Team leader Diethard Posorski said: 'That is a chemical delayed-action detonator. I am not defusing that - I’m not suicidal.' So, rather than defusing the bomb, experts plan to surround it with sand and carry out a controlled explosion as the site. 2.8million tons Weight of all U.S. and British bombs dropped on Germany (54% USAAF) 75,000 tons Weight of Luftwaffe bombs dropped on Britain. 543,000 Germans lost their lives in WWII air raids. 60,000 Britons killed by German bombs. 390,000 Sorties flown by RAF bombers. 2,500 unexploded bombs yet to be found in Munich, according to experts. 5% The proportion of bombs that failed to detonate. A large timber shell was today built around the bomb, which is believed to have been dropped in 1944 or 1945 by either British or American forces. The controlled explosion is likely to take place tomorrow morning. Only then will the 2,500 people living within a 1,000-yard radius of the site in the Schwabing area close to the city centre. A nearby subway station has also been closed as well as parts of Leopoldstrasse, one of Munich’s busiest streets. It is unknown whether American or British planes dropped the bomb, which was discovered as diggers tore a building down. Both countries used the same type of 550lb explosives and rust is understood to have obscured any identifying marks. During the war Royal Air Force and U.S. Army Air Force are estimated to have dropped around 50,000 bombs on Munich. City officials believe that 2,500 unexploded payloads – around 5 per cent of the total dropped - are still buried in the Bavarian capital. Precaution: The bomb, which cannopt be defused, is covered with sand bags ahead of a planned controlled blast. Cordon: A German police officer guards a section of Leopoldstrasse, which has been sealed off along with a a 1,000-yard radius area. A total of 2,500 people have been evacuated. And they pose a huge problem in all of Germany, where barely a week goes by without a new discovery. It is unusual, however, to find a bomb in such a densely populated areas as most undetonated explosives tend to be uncovered outside big urban zones. Allies dropped of 2.8million tons during WWII, massively eclipsing the 75,000 tons unleashed by the Luftwaffe on Britain. By the war’s end, the USAAF had dropped 1.5million tons of bombs on the country and the RAF 1.3million tons. British bombers alone flew a total of 390,000 sorties. Locked out: Evacutated people in an aid station in Munich, where they will have to stay until Wednesday. Round-up: German police officers evacuating apartment buildings after the bomb was found. Sealed off: Recovery vehicles parked on Leopoldstrasse, which has been blocked to traffic. As a result, few towns escaped extensive damage from air raids and, by 1945, 543,000 civilians had been killed by the allied assault, compared with 60,000 in Britain. The worst air raid occurred in Dresden when, over two days, at least 30,000 civilians were killed in attacks by the RAF and the USAAF. Last week a similar 550lb bomb was found in Nuremberg and experts fear that the dud payloads are becoming more dangerous due to ‘material fatigue’. Already 67 years have passed since Germany’s defeat and over time the safety elements in the trigger mechanisms are increasingly wearing away. It means that some bombs could explode before being discovered and others will be more difficult to defuse. In the most deadly incident in recent years, three bomb disposal experts were blown to bits in June 2010 as they attempted to defuse an American bomb in the northern university city of Göttingen.

In present-day Cambodia, Sambath, a talented young journalist, remains haunted by the crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge reign in the late 1970s. Unable to forget the horrors that took his own parents' lives, he embarks on an unforgettable journey to bring the dark past to light. Act 1: Sambath discovers a clue during his investigation: the reclusive Khmer Rouge leader, Nuon Chea, also known as Brother #2, is still alive and hiding in the depths of Cambodia. Fueled by his need for justice and to uncover the truth, Sambath decides to confront the man who may hold the key to understanding the genocide. He seeks support and advice from fellow journalists and history professors about what the public knows about Nuon Chea's role in the genocide, only to be met with reluctance and fear. Act 2: Undeterred by the challenges he faces, Sambath travels through rural Cambodia, investigating leads, seeking eyewitness accounts, and developing new connections that will ultimately lead him to Nuon Chea. Slowly, he gains the trust of the local villagers who provide critical pieces of information about Nuon Chea's location. Along the journey, Sambath wrestles with his personal emotions, torn between his desire for revenge and his duty to reveal the truth about the darkest period in Cambodian history. Act 3: With the help of a local villager named Sokha, played by Sareum Srey Moch, Sambath finally locates Nuon Chea, now a frail old man living in secrecy. As he interviews Nuon Chea, Sambath unfolds the story of the Khmer Rouge regime and the atrocities committed against the Cambodian population. In a series of powerful and emotionally charged conversations, Sambath faces off against the living ghost of his past, forcing him to confront his own internal battle of forgiveness and justice. Despite the chilling revelations of the interview, Sambath manages to maintain his composure and records the conversation for the world to witness, exposing the truth behind the ruthless regime. Finale: As the film reaches its climax, the relationship between Sambath and Sokha deepens, and together they find solace through their shared experiences and losses. Nuon Chea, faced with undeniable proof and the weight of the truth, finally acknowledges his part in the tragedy. The final scene shows Sambath releasing the interview to the public, allowing the long-suppressed truth to emerge from the shadows, offering a sense of closure to the survivors and a chance for their stories to be remembered. In the end, \\"Whispers from the Shadows\\" serves as a reminder of the lasting impact of the Khmer Rouge's brutal regime, and the relentless quest for truth and healing, making it a powerful and poignant drama that gracefully walks the fine line between the past and the present."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine the terms with w on both sides of the equation: (2 - 23) * w = -0 * w - 105 -21 * w = -105 Step 2: Isolate the variable, w. To isolate w, divide both sides of the equation by -21: (-21 * w) / -21 = -105 / -21 w = 5 So, the solution to the equation 2*w - 23*w = -0*w - 105 for w is w = 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2007, Newsweek published an influential cover story proclaiming it \\"the most dangerous country in the world.\\" The bill of particulars for this indictment typically includes the inarguable facts that the Taliban is headquartered in Pakistan, as is what remains of al-Qaeda, as well as an alphabet soup of other jihadist terrorist groups. And in 2011, it became embarrassingly clear that Pakistan had harbored Osama bin Laden for almost a decade, even if unwittingly, in a city not far from the capital, Islamabad. Leading Pakistani liberals are routinely assassinated by militants. Two-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed when she returned from exile in 2007. But there is another side to Pakistan that suggests some underlying strengths that don't make quite as good copy as the OPTIONS: - Benazir Bhutto marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Bergen marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - CNN marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - India marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Islamabad marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Newsweek marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Osama bin Laden marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Pakistan marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Pakistani marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Peter Bergen marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - Taliban marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - West marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. - al-Qaeda marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009.","completion":"- Taliban marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009. The correct answer is \\"Taliban marching towards Islamabad, as they did in 2009.\\" This fits the context of the passage which discusses the dangerous elements in Pakistan and refers to specific groups and events. The other options can be eliminated for various reasons: - Benazir Bhutto, Bergen, CNN, Newsweek, Peter Bergen, and West are not the appropriate subject since they are either individuals, media/publications, or geopolitical entities and not the relevant militant groups mentioned in the passage. - India and Islamabad are incorrect because they refer to a neighboring country and the capital city itself, which are not the subjects of the passage. - Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda are not correct because the passage is focusing on a specific event in 2009 (the march towards Islamabad) which these options do not fit. - Pakistan and Pakistani are incorrect because they are too general and do not refer to a specific militant group or event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Information: - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Carnivora (from Latin \\"car\\" (stem \\"carn-\\") \\"flesh\\" and \\"vorre\\" \\"to devour\\") is a diverse order that includes over 280 species of placental mammals. Its members are formally referred to as carnivorans, whereas the word \\"carnivore\\" (often popularly applied to members of this group) can refer to any meat-eating organism. Carnivorans are the most diverse in size of any mammalian order, ranging from the least weasel (\\"Mustela nivalis\\"), at as little as and , to the polar bear (\\"Ursus maritimus\\"), which can weigh up to , to the southern elephant seal (\\"Mirounga leonina\\"), whose adult males weigh up to and measure up to in length. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Guatemala (, or ), officially the Republic of Guatemala, is a country in Central America bordered by Mexico to the north and west, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest, Belize to the northeast, the Caribbean to the east, Honduras to the east and El Salvador to the southeast. With an estimated population of around 15.8 million, it is the most populated state in Central America. A representative democracy, Guatemala's capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as Guatemala City. - Omnivore is a consumption classification for animals that have the capability to obtain chemical energy and nutrients from materials originating from plant and animal origin. Often, omnivores also have the ability to incorporate food sources such as algae, fungi, and bacteria into their diet as well. - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast. Central America is bordered by Mexico to the north, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Central America consists of seven countries: Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. The combined population of Central America is between 41,739,000 (2009 estimate) and 42,688,190 (2012 estimate). - An endotherm (from Greek \\"endon\\" \\"within\\" and \\"therm\\" \\"heat\\") is an organism that maintains its body at a metabolically favorable temperature, largely by the use of heat set free by its internal bodily functions instead of relying almost purely on ambient heat. Such internally generated heat is mainly an incidental product of the animal's routine metabolism, but under conditions of excessive cold or low activity an endotherm might apply special mechanisms adapted specifically to heat production. Examples include special-function muscular exertion such as shivering, and uncoupled oxidative metabolism such as within brown adipose tissue. Only birds and mammals are extant universally endothermic groups of animals. Certain lamnid sharks, tuna and billfishes are also endothermic. - Theria (Greek: \\"\\", wild beast) is a subclass of mammals amongst the Theriiformes (the sister taxa to Yinotheria). Theria includes the eutherians (including the placental mammals) and the metatherians (including the marsupials). - A mammary gland is an exocrine gland in mammals that produces milk to feed young offspring. Mammals get their name from the word \\"mammary\\". The mammary glands are arranged in organs such as the breasts in primates (for example, humans and chimpanzees), the udder in ruminants (for example, cows, goats, and deer), and the dugs of other animals (for example, dogs and cats). Lactorrhea, the occasional production of milk by the glands, can occur in any mammal, but in most mammals lactation, the production of enough milk for nursing, occurs only in phenotypic females who have gestated in recent months or years. It is directed by hormonal guidance from sex steroids. In a few mammalian species, male lactation can occur. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period. - Panama City is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Panama. It has an urban population of 430,299, and its population totals 880,691 when rural areas are included. The city is located at the Pacific entrance of the Panama Canal, in the province of Panama. The city is the political and administrative center of the country, as well as a hub for international banking and commerce. It is considered a \\"gamma+\\" world city, one of three Central American cities listed in this category. - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - Miacoidea is a paraphyletic superfamily that had been traditionally divided into two families of carnivores: Miacidae (the miacids) and Viverravidae. Miacoids were primitive carnivores that lived during the Paleocene and Eocene Epochs, about 33-66 million years ago. Today, Miacidae is recognized as a paraphyletic array of stem taxa that probably resulted in some \\"miacid\\" genera ending up just outside the order Carnivora, the crown-group within the Carnivoramorpha. Carnivoramorpha consists of both Miacoidea and Carnivora, but excludes the order Creodonta that existed alongside Carnivoramorpha. Miacoids are regarded as basal carnivoramorphs. The miacids are a paraphyletic group containing all miacoids that are not viverravids. - In an ecosystem, predation is a biological interaction where a predator (an organism that is hunting) feeds on its prey (the organism that is attacked). Predators may or may not kill their prey prior to feeding on them, but the act of predation often results in the death of the prey and the eventual absorption of the prey's tissue through consumption. Thus predation is often, though not always, carnivory. Other categories of consumption are herbivory (eating parts of plants), fungivory (eating parts of fungi), and detritivory (the consumption of dead organic material). All these consumption categories fall under the rubric of consumer-resource systems. It can often be difficult to separate various types of feeding behaviors. For example, some parasitic species prey on a host organism and then lay their eggs on it for their offspring to feed on it while it continues to live in or on its decaying corpse after it has died. The key characteristic of predation however is the predator's direct impact on the prey population. On the other hand, detritivores simply eat dead organic material arising from the decay of dead individuals and have no direct impact on the \\"donor\\" organism(s). - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin. - Mustelodon is an extinct carnivore , which belongs to the family Viverravidae . This genus contains only one species , Mustelodon primerus . Fossils of this mammal were found in the 57 million years old deposits of Lago Nandarajo , near the northern border of Panama in Central America . Mustelodon had a length of approximately 80 cm ( head to tail ) and this carnivore superficially resembled the modern mongooses . Mustelodon fed on fruits , insects and smaller mammals like shrews . It is closely related to the more famous Protictis from the Paleocene of the United States ( Wannagan Creek - South Dakota , San Juan Basin - New Mexico ) . - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Viverravidae is an extinct family within the superfamily Miacoidea. They are related to carnivorans, and lived from the early Palaeocene to the Eocene. - Theriiformes is a subclass of mammals. The term was coined in 1997 by McKenna & Bell in their classification of mammals. - Panama, officially called the Republic of Panama, is a country usually considered to be entirely in North America or Central America. It is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia (in South America) to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The capital and largest city is Panama City, whose metropolitan area is home to nearly half of the country's 3.9 million people.

In front of the Louvre Museum. Under the Eiffel Tower. In the Luxembourg Gardens. In front of luxury hotels and mansions. Sometimes even in parking lots. A rage, a trend, a new tradition feeding a lucrative branch of the tourism industry and spreading not only around the most romantic city of the world, but to many other places in France, Great Britain, Greece, Italy and other European countries. Traveling from all over Asia, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, Indonesia and Malaysia, brides and grooms arrive by the hundreds every month to pose in their wedding outfits for romantic photos alongside some of the most famous landmarks - and lately next to less well-known sites. In Paris, they're becoming as ubiquitous as street vendors. Although they look like newlyweds, clad in white wedding dresses, veils, tuxedos, flowers and all the accoutrements, they are, in fact, \\"pre-wedding\\" events organized just for the photos. The real wedding takes place back home, sometimes months later, where showing the portraits as slide shows, posters and videos on big screens is an important part of the celebration. “Most couples take the wedding photos months before the wedding, and it can be a complicated and arduous process that demands days of effort, numerous costume changes, exotic locations and a huge budget, with some shoots costing as much as 15,000,\\" according to research on the pre-wedding industry by Li Zhaoping at China’s Saimaa University. \\"As opposed to Western couples who seek wedding pictures that capture real moments, Asian couples want elaborate photos that reflect their romantic fantasies.” It's not a new fad. In reality, affluent Asian couples have been doing it for years. What's new is that thanks to cheaper travel, their numbers have been steadily growing, creating a prosperous industry that now offers one or multiple photographers, many choices of romantic sites throughout Europe and more than just stylish photos in wedding finery. Florists, hair dressers, makeup artists, brand party gowns, shoes, limos and vintage cars are part of the packages destined to fulfill couples' most romantic dreams - at least in pictures. “A love dream that has a price of about €2,000 to travel to Paris from miles away to take dozens of photos in one day and bring them back home,” explains France 2. An article in Le Monde about the particular tourist wave reports that there are several “wedding agencies” in Paris where the couples can rent either red dresses, which is traditional Chinese, or bride white dresses “a la Parisienne,” shoes, tuxedos, jewels, lace and veils, and arrange hairdressing and makeup. “In the basement, the brides can try hairstyles and have makeup tests,\\" one such agency manager told the paper. \\"On the day of the photos, they will be manicured and adorned with false eyelashes.” Many choose to change multiple times during shoots and appear in glamorous gowns and chic outfits to obtain dreamy images against romantic backdrops like England's White Cliffs of Dover, lavender fields in the south of France, the island of Santorini in Greece and Big Ben in London. A beautiful, 13th-century Cotswold parish church, for example, got caught up in the fad after a couple took beautiful quintessentially English photos there. Bath and the Lake District are also very popular. Some of the expanding services offer elaborate extremes in sessions that can last several days, with lavish photos in flimsy frocks on location such as famous ski resorts for photos in the snow, or at places where popular movies or TV series were filmed. In a South China Morning Post article about the popular tradition it calls “The Downton Abbey effect on Chinese pre-wedding photo shoots,” the paper finds that “fueled by the popular period drama, hundreds of middle-class couples fly to Britain every year and spend thousands of pounds to hire teams of photographers for shoots in locations such as Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton, York and Cornwall’s Land’s End.” The trend, according to the paper, “has been fueled in part by the popularity of Downton Abbey, which drew 160 million viewers in China, and by a Chinese superstar singer-actor, Jay Chou, who married in Yorkshire's Selby Abbey, then held a reception in Castle Howard, made famous by the 1980s TV adaptation of Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited.\\" A £5,000 fee at Castle Howard, which is one of the high-end packages, includes entry and a day of shots inside and outside. A carriage and horse costs another £550. An average package starts at €1,000 for basic nuptial photos at a landmark. Adding two other locations can cost an additional €500 to €1,000, depending of the distance. “On a sweltering hot July afternoon,” describes the South China Morning Post, “they spend four hours earnestly kissing, holding hands, striking film-star poses and running through lavender in what looks like an exhausting session. For one series of shots, the groom carries his betrothed in his arms for 30 paces.” Many other places in France, Britain and other countries are aspiring to achieve a spot on the map of pre-wedding photos choices. According to Le Monde, the booming Asian pre-wedding industry in France - “homeland of romanticism, offering its most beautiful shots to couples from the Far East, among pigeons flying in front of Notre-Dame, dancing in a French garden, at a Bateau-Mouche sailing in front of the illuminated Eiffel tower, at a castle of the XV century or among fields of lavender” - is estimated to be worth more than €1 billion per year. ||||| A couple is photographed in June 2015 at Inside Only Photo Studio on the outskirts of Shanghai. The studio houses three floors of sets for wedding photos, including rooms of dresses and suits. Red dresses, stylists, camera crews and a perfect kiss in front of a sandstone building. On any given weekday, The Bund in Shanghai looks like a scene from a European rom-com. Couples dressed in colorful, elaborate formalwear bustle from site to site, enacting fairytale scenes of marriage, with a team of stylists and photographers in tow. Intrigued by the enchanting entourage, passerby and photographer Olivia Martin-McGuire inquired about the phenomena only to learn that it was not a mass wedding or movie, but a rather common pre-wedding photo shoot. “I was enchanted by an entire nation of adults dressing-up in fantasy attire as part of a new national ritual,\\" she says as she started documenting the shoots. Pre-wedding photography is a lucrative, multi-billion dollar industry in China, adding a playful, new custom to a country deeply rooted in ancient traditions. Martin-McGuire was drawn to the fantasy shoots that gave “a view into another facet of China not so readily portrayed by the media – color, optimism, enthusiasm and a unique ability to play.” In decades past, Martin-McGuire says wedding photos served primarily as proof of the marriage, consisting of a single black-and-white photograph. Now, the pre-wedding photo shoot involves multiple backdrops, settings and costumes. Positioning herself behind the wedding photographer, Martin-McGuire looks to make photos from the vantage point of a choreographer. “I am fascinated by the entire set-up,” she says, “and that obviously includes the image-makers themselves.” The lengths a couple will go to for a perfect shoot are extensive. One high-end studio provides three floors of sets and rooms of wardrobe changes. Others venture out into exotic locations, even those that seem unreachable. Martin-McGuire recalled a November outing to see the famous misty valleys in Guilin, enduring an hour climb in the rain to reach the summit. “Of course, here at the summit I discovered a team of pre-wedding photographers and a couple with a ballooning gown and bags of outfits. They had somehow carried everything up for the shoot!” The photo shoots, which Martin-McGuire says can surpass 100,000 for high-end productions, are ultimately displayed prominently during the betrothed’s wedding. But, the parade of photography does not stop then as the couple is also expected to take a portrait with each of their guests.

Sometimes it may be hard to get into a book, even if you have a comfy spot, good lighting, and no distractions. If there aren’t any immediate time constraints, consider putting down the book and coming back to it at a later time. Try to choose a more relaxing time to revisit the book. For instance, you may find that you are better able to focus early in the morning, after working out, or when all your chores or tasks are done for the day. Your brain absorbs the unfolding of the story and information better when you read paper books. This is because you can observe the thickness of the book and use your body to interact with it (turning the pages, for example) while reading. If you prefer e-readers, that’s okay too! However, if you are struggling to understand books, try reading a paper one and take note of any changes that occur in your comprehension. When you get to the end of a chapter or section of a book, stop and ask yourself if you understand the major themes and events. If you recall what happened and have a good understanding, feel free to proceed. If you don’t, though, you should refresh your memory by going back over the previous pages, chapters, or sections. Keep a notebook next to you while you read. Use several different pieces of paper to keep track of main characters or key terms, major plot points, big-picture questions, and things that confuse you. You can refer to these notes later to remember what the book was about. This is especially helpful for academic texts.

Unlike \\"ante,\\" which simply refers to the initial bet placed by each player, \\"skill\\" encompasses a wide range of abilities that contribute to consistent success in poker. These skills include, but are not limited to: 1. Understanding the rules and mechanics of the game: This foundational knowledge is essential to making informed decisions at the poker table. 2. Reading opponents: Skilled players can assess their opponents' playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses, allowing them to make better decisions about how to counter their moves. 3. Hand reading: This involves estimating the likely strength of an opponent's hand based on their actions and betting patterns. 4. Mathematical knowledge: Knowing the odds of hitting certain hands or outs (cards that will improve a player's hand) is crucial for making smart decisions about whether to call, raise, or fold. 5. Emotional control: Staying calm under pressure and avoiding \\"tilt\\" (making poor decisions due to emotional responses) can help a player maintain their strategic edge. 6. Bankroll management: Understanding how to manage one's funds is crucial to avoiding large losses and staying in the game. 7. Strategy and adaptability: A skilled poker player constantly adjusts their strategy based on the game's dynamics, their opponents, and changing situations. Choosing \\"happiness\\" or \\"losing money\\" as answers does not fit in-context, as they are not directly related to achieving consistent success in poker. \\"Attention\\" is a partial answer, as paying attention is necessary for developing and applying poker skills, but it is not sufficient on its own for consistent success.

Elliot Hopper is a workaholic widower who is about to land the deal of a lifetime at work, which he hopes will win him a promotion and a company car. After he forgets his daughter Diane's birthday, he attempts to make it up to her by promising her she can have his car when he secures the deal at work on the coming Thursday. After being persuaded to give the car to his daughter early, Elliot must hail a taxi from work, which is driven by Satanist Curtis Burch, who drives erratically and is of control.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided indicates information relating to Playboy Magazine's Playmates of the Month for the decade of 1970-1979. This would be a ten-year span of monthly features carried out by Playboy, a popular adult entertainment magazine that's prominent for its provocative photography and cultural impact. One key piece of information mentioned in the data is the year 1970 and the specificity of '1970 January Jill Taylor'. This implies that Jill Taylor was the playmate for the month of January in 1970, i.e., she was the model featured in Playboy Magazine's centerfold and main pictorial for that upcoming month. Playboy, founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953, is an American men's lifestyle and entertainment magazine that has played a substantial part in the sexual revolution and remains an influential platform in modern America's societal standards for beauty and attractiveness. The Playboy Playmates of the Month are a characteristic aspect of Playboy Magazine. Every month, a young woman is chosen to be a Playmate and is featured in the magazine with a centerfold picture and a detailed pictorial. These Playmates are often up-and-coming models or actresses, but occasionally they include celebrities too. The selected Playmate of the Month is also considered for the prestigious title of 'Playmate of the Year'. The 'Playmates of the Month' for the 1970-1979 decade would signify a comprehensive list of all the women who held the title during these years. Such a list would encapsulate a detailed dossier of 120 models (12 months x 10 years), chronicling an era significant for its contributions to evolving cultural norms and acceptance of societal nudity. It should be noted that such compilations not merely represent the aesthetic trends of the time and the evolving perceptions of beauty, but they also indicate other societal changes, such as shifting attitudes towards women's autonomy. Each entry in this data, structured as 'Year Month Name', would likely represent the Playmate for the specified month and year, indicating her ascendancy to the Playboy pantheon during this period. Studying the data provides a reference point for understanding the zeitgeist of the era, the shifting sociocultural context, and the evolving standards of beauty and sexuality in society. Furthermore, it represents the professional trajectory and public recognition of the individuals featured. To summarize, this data signifies a list documenting the Playboy Playmates of the Month for each month from 1970-1979, with the month, year, and name of the playmate. For instance, the mention of '1970 JANUARY Jill Taylor' indicates that Jill Taylor was the feature in the January 1970 issue of Playboy Magazine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Eric asked Ian to teach their child how speak Spanish because","completion":"he believed in the benefits of raising a bilingual child. Ian, who was fluent in Spanish, agreed and started devising a plan, step by step, to help their young child learn the language. Step 1: Language Exposure First, Ian decided to expose their child to Spanish by creating a language-rich environment at home. He made it a point to speak to the child in Spanish for certain parts of the day. He also played Spanish music, put up posters with Spanish words, and replaced commonly used items in the house with ones labeled in Spanish. By doing so, Ian believed that the child would naturally associate objects and emotions with their Spanish terms. Step 2: Vocabulary Building Once their child became familiar with the sounds of the Spanish language, Ian started focusing on building their vocabulary. He taught the child commonly used nouns, verbs, and adjectives in Spanish. Ian would show flashcards, name objects in both English and Spanish, and engage the child in simple conversations to reinforce the new words they've learned. Step 3: Sentence Construction Building on the vocabulary that the child now knew, Ian began to teach them how to construct simple sentences. He started by teaching the child basic grammar rules and conjugations. To make it more engaging, Ian created fun activities and games to provide ample practice for sentence construction. Step 4: Interactive Learning To help immerse their child further into the Spanish language, Ian sought out opportunities to engage in conversations with native speakers. They visited local Spanish-speaking communities and used video calls to communicate with Spanish-speaking relatives. This gave the child a chance to practice their newfound skills with a variety of different people and accents. Step 5: Bilingual Media Consumption Ian encouraged the child to consume media in Spanish, such as cartoons, movies, and books, to reinforce the language and develop listening comprehension skills. This allowed the child to gain familiarity with conversational Spanish and everyday language used by native speakers. Step 6: Regular Practice Finally, Ian emphasized the importance of regular practice and made a schedule to ensure that their child spent enough time learning and practicing Spanish. Consistency was key in helping their child become a proficient Spanish speaker. Though the process was slow and steady, Ian's dedication and patience paid off as the child progressively became more and more comfortable speaking Spanish. Eric admired the hard work and effort Ian put into teaching their child a second language, and they both knew that the linguistic abilities would open up a world of opportunities for their child's future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

'Prostitute' accused of injecting Google executive with lethal dose of heroin Alix Tichelman appears at Santa Cruz superior court following the death of Forrest Hayes, a Google executive. Photograph: Shmuel Thaler/AP An alleged prostitute, accused of injecting heroin into a Google executive on his yacht in California and leaving him to die when he overdosed, appeared in court on Wednesday on manslaughter and heroin charges. Alix Tichelman, 26, in handcuffs and a red jumpsuit, did not enter a plea and was appointed a public defender. She is being held on 1.5m (£900,000) bail. Surveillance footage from the yacht shows Tichelman gather her belongings, including the heroin and needles, step over the 51-year-old victim's body to finish a glass of wine and then lower a blind before leaving the boat, Santa Cruz police said. Police said Tichelman did not provide first aid or call emergency services as the man, identified as Forrest Timothy Hayes, suffered medical complications and lost consciousness during the November overdose aboard his 50ft (15-metre) yacht, Escape. His body was discovered the next morning by the boat's captain, police said. Police are also investigating Tichelman in connection with a similar incident in another state, the Santa Cruz deputy police chief, Steve Clark, said. \\"There's a pattern of behaviour here where she doesn't seek help when someone is in trouble,\\" he said. Tichelman's lawyer, Diana August, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Assistant district attorney Rafael Vazquez said authorities are still investigating the case and may file more serious charges. Tichelman was arrested on 4 July after police said a detective lured her back to the Santa Cruz area by posing as a potential client and reaching agreement on a price of more than 1,000. Police said Tichelman, who boasted she had more than 200 clients, met her clients through the website SeekingArrangement.com, which purports to connect wealthy men and women with attractive companions. Her clients included other Silicon Valley executives, Clark said. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Q:Information: - The London Underground (also known simply as the Underground, or by its nickname the Tube) is a public rapid transit system serving Greater London and some parts of the adjacent counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. - The Tube map is a schematic transport map of the lines, stations and services of London's public transport systems, the primary system being London Underground, known colloquially as \\"the Tube\\", hence the map's name. The first schematic Tube map was designed by Harry Beck in 1931, and it has since been expanded to also include today the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, TfL Rail, Tramlink and the Emirates Air Line cable car. - Upminster is a suburban town in east London, England, and part of the London Borough of Havering. Located east-northeast of Charing Cross, it is one of the locally important district centres identified in the London Plan, and comprises a number of shopping streets and a large residential area. It was historically, a rural village in Essex and formed an ancient parish. Although peripheral to London, the town has good transport links; it was first connected to central London by rail in 1885 and has a terminal station on the London Underground network. The economic history of Upminster is characterised by a shift from farming to garden suburb. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Upminster significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1934, and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. - Earl's Court is a district in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in central London, bordering the sub-districts of South Kensington to the east, West Kensington to the west, Chelsea to the south and Kensington to the north. The Earl's Court Exhibition Centre was one of the country's largest indoor arenas and a popular concert venue until its closure in 2014. - The London Borough of Ealing is a London Borough in west London, England, and forms part of Outer London. It is the 3rd largest London Borough in population, and 11th largest in size, covering part of west London and a small part of north west London. Its administrative centre is Ealing Broadway. Other major centres include Acton, Greenford and Southall. The local authority is Ealing London Borough Council. - The North London Line is a railway line of the London Overground, which passes through the inner suburbs of north London, England. Its route is a rough semicircle from the south west to the north east, avoiding central London. The line is owned and maintained by Network Rail and London Overground. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. - Paddington is an area within the City of Westminster, in central London. Formerly a metropolitan borough, it was integrated with Westminster and Greater London in 1965. Three important landmarks of the district are Paddington station, designed by the celebrated engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and opened in 1847; St Mary's Hospital; and Paddington Green Police Station (the most important high-security police station in the United Kingdom). - Central London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. - Chiswick is a district of west London, England. Most of it is in the London Borough of Hounslow. Other parts of the W4 postcode area, including Chiswick Park tube station, Acton Green, and much of Bedford Park are in the London Borough of Ealing.

It occupies a meander of the River Thames used for competitive and recreational rowing, with several rowing clubs on the river bank. The finishing post for the Boat Race is just downstream of Chiswick Bridge. - Rapid transit, also known as heavy rail, metro, subway, tube, or underground, is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas. Unlike buses or trams, rapid transit systems are electric railways that operate on an exclusive right-of-way, which cannot be accessed by pedestrians or other vehicles of any sort, and which is often grade separated in tunnels or on elevated railways. - Transport for London (TfL) is a local government body responsible for the transport system in Greater London, England. Its head office is in Windsor House in the City of Westminster. - In Great Britain, National Rail is the trading name licensed for use by the Rail Delivery Group, an unincorporated association whose membership consists of the passenger train operating companies (TOCs) of Great Britain that run the passenger services previously provided by the British Railways Board, from 1965 using the brand name British Rail. National Rail generally does not include services that do not have a BR history; this distinction is important because National Rail services share a ticketing structure and inter-availability that do not necessarily extend to other services. The name and the accompanying double arrow symbol are the intellectual property of the Secretary of State for Transport. - The Piccadilly line is a line of the London Underground, coloured dark blue on the Tube map. It is the fourth busiest line on the Underground network on the basis of the number of passengers transported per year with 210,000,000. It is mainly a deep-level line, running from the north to the west of London via Zone 1, with a number of surface sections, mostly in its westernmost parts. It is named after the road above it between Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus. Some of its stations are shared with the District line and some are shared with the Metropolitan line. It is the second longest line on the system, after the Central line, and has the second most stations, after the District line. It serves many of London's top tourist attractions including Harrods (Knightsbridge), Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace (within walking distance from Green Park), Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square and Covent Garden, as well as London Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport in Europe. The line shares tracks with the Metropolitan line between Uxbridge and Rayners Lane, and with the District line between Hanger Lane Junction and Acton Town, then runs parallel with the District line between Acton Town and Barons Court. - Edgware Road is a major road through north-west London, starting at Marble Arch in the City of Westminster (south end) and running north-west to Edgware in the London Borough of Barnet. It is also a boundary between several North London boroughs. The route has its origins as a Roman road (part of Watling Street) and therefore runs for 10 miles in an almost perfect straight line, which is unusual in London. It is part of the modern A5 road. It undergoes several name changes along its length, including Maida Vale, Kilburn High Road, Shoot Up Hill and Cricklewood Broadway; but the road is, as a whole, known as the Edgware Road, as it is the road to Edgware. - The London Borough of Hounslow is a London borough in west London, England, forming part of Outer London. The borough stretches from near Central London in the east to the border with Surrey in the west, covering Chiswick, Brentford, Isleworth and Feltham in addition to Hounslow itself; it borders the boroughs of Richmond upon Thames, Hammersmith and Fulham, Ealing and Hillingdon, plus the Surrey borough of Spelthorne. Landmarks include Osterley Park, Gunnersbury Park, Syon House, the London Museum of Water & Steam and Chiswick House. The local authority is Hounslow London Borough Council. - The London Overground (also known as the Overground) is a suburban rail network in the United Kingdom. Established in 2007, it serves a large part of Greater London and parts of Hertfordshire, with 112 stations on several routes. The network forms part of the National Rail network, but under the franchise control and branding of Transport for London (TfL). Operation has been franchised to Arriva Rail London since 13 November 2016. - Network Rail is the owner (via its subsidiary Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd which was known as Railtrack plc before 2003)) and infrastructure manager of most of the rail network in England, Scotland and Wales. Network Rail is an arms length public body of the Department for Transport with no shareholders, which reinvests its income in the railways. - The District line is a London Underground service that crosses Greater London from east to west. From Upminster, the eastern terminus, the line runs through Central London to Earl's Court before dividing into three western branches, to Ealing Broadway, Wimbledon and Richmond. There is a short branch that goes from Earl's Court to . A branch also runs north from Earl's Court to Edgware Road via Paddington. Coloured green on the tube map, the line serves 60 stations in , and with bridges across the Thames on the Wimbledon and Richmond branches is the only London Underground line to cross the river in this way. The track and stations between Barking and Aldgate East are shared with the Hammersmith & City line, and between Tower Hill and Gloucester Road and on the Edgware Road branch with the Circle line. Some of the stations are shared with the Piccadilly line. Unlike London's deep-level tube railways, the railway tunnels are just below the surface, and the trains are of a similar size to those on British main lines. - Gunnersbury station is a London Underground and London Overground station in Gunnersbury in west London . The station , managed by London Underground , is served by District line trains to and from Richmond , and by London Overground trains on the North London Line .

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Market research firm IDC has raised its 2004 forecast for global personal computer sales growth to 14.2 percent from 13.5 percent, driven by high commercial demand, it said on Monday.","completion":"This passage is about the International Data Corporation (IDC), an American market research firm, revising its global personal computer (PC) sales growth forecast for the year 2004. In this revision, IDC increased its projection of PC sales growth from 13.5 percent to 14.2 percent. The reason behind this growth adjustment is the high commercial demand for PCs during that period. To provide a detailed analysis, let's break down the key aspects of this passage: 1. International Data Corporation (IDC): IDC is a premier global market research firm that specializes in providing market intelligence and advisory services for the information technology, telecommunications, and consumer technology markets. Founded in 1964, IDC is now a subsidiary of International Data Group (IDG), and its analyses and insights help industry leaders make informed business decisions about their products, services, and strategies. 2. 2004 Forecast: The year mentioned in the passage is 2004, which is a specific time period that this news is focused on. The PC market has always been affected by various factors, and over the past decades, there have been significant changes and developments in technology that impact the growth of the industry. During the 2000s, there was a wide adoption of computers and the internet, and businesses started increasingly relying on them for their operations. It is crucial to mention the year, as this context provides information on the state of the industry and market trends during that time. 3. Global Personal Computer Sales Growth: Personal computers allow users to perform various tasks, such as word processing, accessing the internet, and managing data. The worldwide sales growth of PCs is an important indicator of the health of the technology sector and the overall economy. In this context, IDC's projection is not just limited to a particular region or country but covers the entire global market for PC sales. 4. 14.2 percent from 13.5 percent: IDC increased its forecast for the growth of PC sales in 2004 to 14.2 percent, up from the previously predicted 13.5 percent. This represents a 0.7 percent increase in the expected growth. The change in the forecast signifies that IDC expects the industry's sales to perform better than initially anticipated. 5. Driven by High Commercial Demand: The main reason behind this increase in the forecasted PC sales growth is attributed to high commercial demand. This suggests that businesses and organizations were one of the key drivers for increased PC sales. The growing dependence on computers for the smooth functioning of businesses could have contributed to this higher demand. This also implies that the commercial sector was a significant factor in the growth of the PC market during that year. In conclusion, this passage is about IDC revising its 2004 global personal computer sales growth forecast to 14.2 percent, citing the reason behind this increase as high commercial demand for PCs. This showcases the importance of continuous analysis and monitoring of market trends for accurate forecasts, as well as the industry's reliance on commercial buyers for sustainable growth."},{"prompt":"The input is a tweet which can be Hate Speech or Offensive.

Quickly tracing a mouse family's history in England, we see how the family was forced to go to America due to an excess of cats.In America, the film then focuses on Amos, a 1740s mouse living in a Philadelphia church. His attempts to land a job lead him to Benjamin Franklin's printing shop. He helps Franklin erase his debts, create a successful newspaper, invent new devices, and even helps make him more popular and respected with the people of the city.After Franklin involves Amos, without his permission, in the famous kite electricity experiment that nearly kills him, Amos is outraged and leaves him. Franklin's attempts to work alone prove disastrous such as a failed diplomatic mission to the King that pushes the colonies to open armed revolt.They finally reconcile in 1776 when Franklin begs Amos to return and agrees to sign a contract drafted by the mouse for more considerate treatment. Furthermore, as Franklin examines the agreement, Thomas Jefferson arrives to ask for help for the beginning of the Declaration of Independence he is writing. Amos insists that Franklin read his own agreement out loud at that moment and its wording inspires Jefferson to create an appropriate opening to his own piece.The movie ends with a return to the tour group in the present.

But if you want to raise new fish, you may want to add 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to everything. Determine how many bodies of water to add per month, and how your tank will match those numbers.. 2). For their number, you should provide about 2-4 dead per gallon. They can live in a normal tank (if that is one), but aren't as likely to become aggressive with other fish.. 3).

Determine what size tank you want to place your fish in.. 4). Size your tank based on the adult size of the fish, not their current size. Platies get up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) long as adults..","completion":"4). Size your tank based on the adult size of the fish, not their current size. Platies get up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) long as adults. To breed and care for platies, it is important to take into consideration their adult size, as this will directly affect the tank size, water quality, and overall health of the platies. Once you've determined the appropriate size of the tank based on the adult size of the fish, follow these steps to successfully breed and care for your platies: 1. Set up the tank: Prepare the tank with a filter, heater, and some stones or decorations to create a comfortable environment for your platies. The ideal temperature for platies is between 72°F to 78°F (22°C to 25°C). Make sure to cycle the tank for at least a month before introducing the fish to establish a stable environment. 2. Choose the ratio of male to female platies: The ideal ratio for breeding platies is one male per two or three females. This will prevent the females from becoming overly exhausted by continuous courtship and ensure a greater chance of successful breeding. 3. Provide hiding spots: Since platies are livebearers and can potentially eat their own fry (baby fish), it is crucial to provide hiding spots for the little ones to increase their chances of survival. This can be done with plants, rocks, or other decorations in the tank. 4. Feed a balanced diet: To encourage breeding and keep your fish healthy, provide high-quality flake or pellet food, as well as live or frozen foods, such as brine shrimp and daphnia, which can promote breeding behaviors. 5. Monitor water parameters: Regularly test your tank's water for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels, and maintain a consistent pH of 7.0-8.2. Conduct a 10-20% water change weekly to keep the water parameters stable. 6. Watch for signs of pregnancy: Female platies can become pregnant shortly after being introduced to a male. A pregnant female will have a visibly rounder belly, and you may notice a dark spot near the anal fin, known as the gravid spot, which is an indicator that she is carrying eggs. 7. Separate pregnant females (optional): If you want to increase the survival rate of the fry, consider setting up a separate breeding tank or using a breeder net to accommodate the pregnant female. This will help protect the fry from being eaten by other tank mates once they are born. 8. Care for the fry: Once the fry are born, they must be fed a diet suitable for their size. Crushed flakes, infusoria, or other small and easily digestible foods are ideal for fry. As the fry grow and become more nimble, they can be transferred to the main tank. 9. Repeat the process: Platies can breed every month, so by maintaining a stable environment and appropriate breeding conditions, you will be able to continuously raise new generations of platies. By following these steps and providing the necessary care and attention to your platies, you can successfully breed and maintain a healthy population of these colorful and hardy fish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: More and more people are trying to learn English than any other language in the world. English is the world language of politics and international business. It becomes the international language of science, medicine, sports, travel and so on. In most schools in Asia, English is taught as the main foreign language. School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age. English is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States and Australia. Many different languages are spoken in some countries. However, English is often used as an official language to help people communicate with each other. India is a good example. English is the common language in this country, but at least twenty-four languages are spoken there. Do you know the history of English? Old English took many words from the French language. Most English words came from French, especially those words used for describing the law and the government, such as \\"damage\\",\\" prison \\"and \\" marriage\\". Then, English became what language experts called Middle English. The history of English continues as Middle English, and then it becomes Modern English, and it is spoken today. ,. Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: Students in Japan begin to learn English when they are young. B: English is the official language of all the countries in the world. C: English is used as an official language in many countries but not in India. D: Some words in English are only used for describing those people in prison and in marriage. Answer:","completion":"From the passage, we can learn several key points about the English language. It informs us about the prominence of English in the global arena, its widespread use, its history, and how it's considered a vital language to learn, particularly in Asian countries such as China and Japan. According to option A, \\"students in Japan begin to learn English when they are young.\\" This statement aligns with the information given in the text. The passage clearly states, \\"School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age.\\" Therefore, we can infer that this option accurately represents a fact from the passage. Option B states, \\"English is the official language of all the countries in the world.\\" This is incorrect. Although the text emphasizes the widespread usage of English, saying that it is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States, and Australia, it does not claim that it is the official language of all the countries globally. Option C, \\"English is used as an official language in many countries but not in India,\\" is also incorrect. As per the passage, English is indeed used as a common language in India, even with the existence of over twenty-four other spoken languages in the country. Lastly, option D, \\"Some words in English are only used for describing those people in prison and in marriage,\\" is not supported by information provided in the passage. The text states that certain English words, particularly those related to the law and government, have French roots; however, it does not suggest that these words are exclusively used to describe people in prison or marriage. In conclusion, out of the four options given, option A: \\"Students in Japan begin to learn English when they are young,\\" is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Harvey had been the last to speak to Oates . Oates had been the last person to speak to Harvey . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these sentences do not convey the exact same meaning. The sentence \\"Harvey had been the last to speak to Oates\\" suggests that Harvey was the last person to have any conversation with Oates. This implies an instance of conversation that occurred between multiple people and Oates, where Harvey happened to be the last person in that sequence to speak. The focus here is on Harvey's action of speaking to Oates. On the other hand, \\"Oates had been the last person to speak to Harvey\\" implies that Oates was the last one to have a conversation with Harvey. This suggests a scenario where several people, including Oates, have had some form of communication with Harvey and Oates ended up being the last person in that sequence to communicate. Here, the emphasis is on Oates' action of speaking to Harvey. So, while both sentences talk about a communication that occurred between Harvey and Oates, they differ in who is presented as the last speaker and the listener. The first sentence focuses on Harvey as the last speaker to Oates, while the second sentence assigns that role to Oates in a conversation with Harvey. The ordering of communication and the roles of Harvey and Oates as speaker and listener change between the two sentences, hence they are not equivalent in meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's analyze this review through these lenses: 1. Clarity: The review is slightly unclear as to what the subject under analysis is. \\"Are world in 90 mins\\" might refer to a show, presentation, or event related to world geography, history, or culture. However, without a better understanding of the specific subject matter it is difficult to gauge the clarity of the review. Rating: 1.5/5 2. Informativeness: The review lacks substantial information about the event, experience or product. Apart from using the word \\"Awesome,\\" which might imply that the reviewer had a positive experience or enjoyed it, there is limited insight as to why the experience, event or product should be rated that way. Rating: 1/5 3. Relevance: While there is limited information available, we can assume that the review is targeted toward something that can be experienced in a short 90-minute timeframe. However, it would've been helpful if the review had mentioned how the world (which could refer to history, geography, or major events) is presented in the given time. Rating: 2/5 4. Grammar: The review suffers from improper grammar and punctuation. For instance, it starts with \\"Are world\\" instead of \\"Our world,\\" and it is missing a comma between \\"90 mins\\" and \\"Awesome\\", which could have made it easier to understand. The lack of proper grammar disrupts the flow of the review. Rating: 1/5 5. Comprehensiveness: The brevity of the review poses issues in comprehensiveness. The word \\"Awesome\\" is an opinion and doesn't provide any constructive feedback or analysis of the content of the event, experience, or product. Ideally, a more comprehensive review would include essential highlights, specific praises, and recommendations for improvement. Rating: 1/5 Upon considering these five factors, I would give this review an overall rating of 1.5/5. The review could benefit from improvements in clarity, informativeness, grammar, and comprehensiveness. The reviewer should focus on providing more context and specific insights into the experience or product being reviewed, as well as adherence to proper grammar to effectively communicate their opinion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast.

Possible Outcomes: 1. Opponents want to exploit Tracy. 2. Opponents want to hide from people. 3. Opponents want to cover up her mistake. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Since Tracy's actions have left the secret strategy exposed, it becomes beneficial for opponents to take advantage of the situation. Exploiting Tracy would mean exploiting the weakness her actions have created in her team's strategy. 2. Hiding from people might be relevant in cases where opponents want to avoid exposing their own plans or intentions. However, given the context, hiding isn't directly related to Tracy's mistake, and it would not help the opponents take advantage of the situation. 3. Covering up Tracy's mistake would mean fixing the vulnerability she created, which contradicts the goal of opponents to weaken their adversaries.

According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or incarnate, and earthly beings can ascend to Heaven in the afterlife, or in exceptional cases enter Heaven alive. - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability. - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war. - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857 10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\" - Francis Konrad Schuckardt ( July 10 , 1937 -- November 5 , 2006 ) was an American Traditionalist Catholic independent bishop and the first known bishop of the sedevacantist movement in the United States . Sedevacantism holds that Pope Paul VI -- sometimes going back to include John XXIII -- and his successors are not valid Popes . Schuckardt founded the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen ( CMRI ) and the Tridentine Latin Rite Catholic Church ( TLRCC ) . - The Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI) (Latin: \\"Congregatio Mariae Reginae Immaculatae\\") is a Sedevacantist Traditionalist Catholic religious congregation that rejects the authority of the recent Popes, including Benedict XVI and Francis, and is dedicated to promoting the message of Our Lady of Fátima and devotion to the Virgin Mary according to the teachings of St. Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort (1673-1716), whom they regard as their spiritual founder. Over the years, the Congregation has also been known as the Fatima Crusaders and Oblates of Mary Immaculate Queen of the Universe. - Traditionalist Catholics are members of the Catholic Church who believe that there should be a restoration of many or all of the customs, traditions, liturgical forms, public and private devotions and presentations of the teaching of the Church before the Second Vatican Council (196265). They are commonly associated with an attachment to the Eucharistic liturgy often called the Tridentine, Traditional Latin or extraordinary form of the Mass. - Our Lady of Fátima (formally known as Our Lady of the Holy Rosary of Fátima \\"\\" ), is a Roman Catholic title of the Blessed Virgin Mary based on the famed Marian apparitions reported in 1917 by three shepherd children at the Cova da Iria, in Fátima, Portugal. The three little children were Lúcia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Marto. - Pope Paul VI, born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini (26 September 1897 6 August 1978), reigned as Pope from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978. Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini later became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors. - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\". - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Pope Saint John XXIII (born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, ; 25 November 18813 June 1963) reigned as Pope from 28 October 1958 to his death in 1963 and was canonized on 27 April 2014. Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was the fourth of fourteen children born to a family of sharecroppers who lived in a village in Lombardy. He was ordained to the priesthood on 10 August 1904 and served in a number of posts, including papal nuncio in France and a delegate to Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey. In a consistory on 12 January 1953 Pope Pius XII made Roncalli a cardinal as the Cardinal-Priest of Santa Prisca in addition to naming him as the Patriarch of Venice. - The College of Cardinals, formerly styled Sacred College of Cardinals, is the body of all cardinals of the Catholic Church. Functions. A function of the college is to advise the pope about church matters when he summons them to an ordinary consistory, a term derived from the Roman Emperor's crown council. It also attends various functions as a matter of protocol, for example, during the canonization process. It also convenes on the death or resignation of a pope as a papal conclave to elect a successor, but is then restricted to eligible Cardinals under the age limit, which was set for the first time in 1970 by Pope Paul VI at 80. - The Nicene Creed (Greek: or, , Latin: \\"\\") is a Symbol of faith widely used in Christian liturgy. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Domenico Tardini (29 February 1888 30 July 1961) was a longtime aide to Pope Pius XII in the Secretariat of State. Pope John XXIII named him Cardinal Secretary of State and, in this position the most prominent member of the Roman Curia in Vatican City.

There are multiple reasons why concluding such a connection between these two statements is not feasible: 1. Lack of context: The statements do not provide enough information about the circumstances, location, or the individuals involved. It is unclear if the man in the tank top is the same man who is going to ask out a woman or if these are two separate situations. Similarly, the woman near the water sculpture may or may not be the same woman being asked out. Additional context is required to establish a connection between these two events. 2. Inference limitations: While it is possible that a man asking out a woman could look at her beforehand, the statement \\"A man in a tank top looks at a woman near a water sculpture\\" does not indicate intent or action in asking someone out. We would need more information to support the assumption that the man looking at the woman is the same man who plans to ask her out. 3. Unrelated events: It's entirely possible that these two statements describe two unrelated events. The man in the tank top looking at a woman near a water sculpture could simply be admiring her or the water sculpture itself without any intention of asking her out. Without sufficient information to link these two events, we cannot conclude that they are related. 4. Different timeframes: The two statements could be occurring at different moments. The man might be planning to ask out a woman later in the day or week, while the scene described in the first statement could be simply coincidental and not related to the act of asking someone out. 5. Alternative scenarios: There may be other crucial details left out of the statements that would significantly alter their meaning or context. For example, the man in the tank top might be glancing at the woman while jogging by, unrelated to any plans to ask her out. Or the man intending to ask the woman out might be hesitating and not necessarily looking at her. In conclusion, without more context or information about the individuals, location, intent, or circumstances, it is not possible to definitively conclude that a man in a tank top looking at a woman near a water sculpture is the same man who is going to ask out a woman. These events may be connected or entirely unrelated, and additional information is necessary to draw a connection between them."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Available choices: *not enough information. *because he couldn't pass gym. *because he couldn't pass math. *because he couldn't pass physics. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: One student started packing up at the beginning of a lab exercise. I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said. Next class he moved from the seat at the edge of my peripheral vision, to the middle, started working his ass off, and he passed. For a while I thought he was closing in on a C, but he got his D and graduated. And I didn’t give him anymore of a grading break than I give any of my students. Question: Why did the student think he wasn't going to graduate? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The student thought he wasn't going to graduate because he was struggling with and expected to fail his physics class. As mentioned earlier, even though his major did not require expertise in physics, it was a gatekeeper course – meaning it was a requirement for graduation. This particular student had procrastinated taking the physics class and took it much later in his studies, which was one of the reasons he was having challenges with the subject. Additionally, the student seemed to have adopted a defeatist attitude and had given up on trying to pass the course. His lack of effort and self-belief played a significant role in his expectation of failure. Despite knowing that he could reach out to his professor for assistance and attending extra office hours, he had yet to take any steps towards improving his grades. It was only after his conversation with the professor and a follow-up meeting with his counselor that the student decided to change his perspective and invest more effort into the course. He started attending classes regularly, participating more and completing his assignments, which subsequently lead to him passing the course with a grade of D and ultimately graduating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that the woman the trapper falls in love is married to? ? Trapper Jed Cooper and his two best friends Gus and Mungo are relieved of their possessions by some unfriendly Indians, so they seek shelter at a nearby army fort, commanded by Captain Riordan. The captain recruits the three men as scouts. Also at the fort is Corrina Marston, waiting for her missing husband, Colonel Frank Marston. Jed quickly falls in love with Mrs. Marston, sensing her ambivalence about her husband; when the colonel returns, he is revealed to be an unmitigated tyrant. Colonel Marston is driven to redeem himself after a disastrous battle at Shiloh, where over a thousand of his men were killed unnecessarily. Marston wants to attack the regional Indian chief, Red Cloud, believing this will restore his good name and return him to the battle back east. He ignores the fact that most of the men at the fort are raw recruits, hopelessly outnumbered and completely unprepared for the vicious fighting they will face with the Indians. Jed is faced with the decision of letting Marston go on with his mad scheme, or finding a way to do away with him.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: as normal B: as fine C: as sick Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, the most appropriate answer to the question of how Kendall would feel afterwards is C: as sick. Since Kendall took snake poison and ended up getting sick forever, it is logical to assume that they would continue to feel sick in the aftermath of this experience. Taking snake poison could have significant and long-lasting effects on Kendall's body and overall well-being. Snake venom contains a variety of toxic substances that can cause severe damage to an individual, including problems with the cardiovascular, respiratory, nervous, and muscular systems. Depending on the type of snake venom that Kendall ingested, they might experience any combination of the following symptoms: 1. Pain, swelling, and bruising around the bite area or ingestion site 2. Difficulty breathing due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles or constriction of the airways 3. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain as a result of digestive system disruptions 4. Weakness and muscle pain due to the breakdown of muscle tissue 5. Seizures, paralysis, and other neurological symptoms as the venom interferes with the nervous system 6. Bleeding disorders such as internal bleeding or uncontrolled bleeding from wounds 7. Kidney failure or other organ damage due to the destructive effects of the venom on tissues In Kendall's case, the severe and enduring nature of their sickness would likely contribute to a number of persistent issues affecting their daily life. Chronic pain, fatigue, and mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression may arise as they grapple with their new reality. Additionally, they might need ongoing medical care and support to manage their symptoms and limit their exposure to potential triggers or complications. As a result of these factors, it's clear that option C: as sick best answers the question in accordance with the context presented. Both options A: as normal and B: as fine imply that Kendall would recover from the snake poisoning and not experience any lasting effects, which is contradictory to the information given. Instead, Kendall would experience ongoing sickness and discomfort as a consequence of their unfortunate encounter with snake poison."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Providing the deal is completed in time, the 32-year-old could make his debut against former club Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Saturday, where he will look to continue a remarkable trend of scoring on every debut he has had for each of his clubs. He scored the winner and led West Ham to victory over Walsall on his debut in 2000, before marking the first appearance of a loan spell to Bournemouth with a goal in a 2-1 defeat to Stoke. Defoe celebrates scoring on his Tottenham debut after 13 minutes in a 4-3 win over Portsmouth. When Defoe made his Portsmouth debut, he scored the goal that earned his team a point at home to Chelsea. Defoe departed West Ham for a move to Tottenham in 2004 and scored after 13 minutes in his first game for the club, a 4-3 win over Portsmouth. And Portsmouth became the next destination for Defoe in 2008 and the striker instantly endeared himself to the Fratton Park faithful by earning the south coast side a point in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea.

A judge is listening to testimony from witnesses before deciding what punishment the double-amputee Olympian must serve after convicting him of culpable homicide for shooting Steenkamp in his home last year. (AP Photo/Alon Skuy, Pool) (The Associated Press) PRETORIA, South Africa – Oscar Pistorius must \\"pay for what he's done\\" and his apology to the family of the girlfriend he killed was not sincere, a cousin of Reeva Steenkamp testified Thursday. Kim Martin spoke on the fourth day of the sentencing portion of the double-amputee Olympian's trial. Following the testimony, which is expected to end this week, Judge Thokozile Masipa will rule on what punishment Pistorius must serve after convicting him of culpable homicide for shooting Steenkamp through a toilet door in his home. \\"My lady, I really believe the accused, Mr. Pistorius, needs to pay for what he's done,\\" Martin testified before the red-robed judge. \\"My family are not seeking revenge,\\" Martin said. \\"We just feel to take somebody's life, to shoot somebody behind the door who is unarmed, who is harmless, needs sufficient punishment.\\" Just after the court adjourned for lunch, Pistorius' sister Aimee became tearful and distraught, telling her family that a man who was behind her in the gallery had mouthed an obscenity at her. Pistorius' brother, Carl, said he would inform police about the courtroom incident. Marc Strydom and Mikey Schultz, two men who said they were in court to support Steenkamp's family, denied any involvement in the alleged incident. \\"They're making up a fabricated story, same as Oscar's,\\" Schultz said. \\"They're all a bunch of liars.\\" Schultz is a former boxer and the self-confessed killer of a businessman who escaped prosecution in an immunity deal with the state. He has been seen sitting in court this week with two men who have had altercations with Pistorius in the past. Pistorius was acquitted of murder for the Feb. 14, 2013 killing and found guilty of the lesser crime of negligent killing. Masipa has wide latitude when deciding on a sentence for culpable homicide, and could order a suspended sentence and a fine, house arrest, or send him to prison for up to 15 years. Testimony in the sentencing hearing ended Thursday. The prosecution and defense said they would deliver final arguments on Friday, clearing the way for the judge to deliver the sentence at a date yet to be announced. Defense lawyers have argued for a sentence of three years of house arrest with community service. In the first part of the sentencing hearing, they called a psychologist and social workers, who said that Pistorius should not go to prison because of his ongoing emotional suffering. They also said his disability as a double amputee who needs prosthetic legs would leave him vulnerable in jail. Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel has called suggestions of a house arrest sentence as \\"shockingly inappropriate\\" and wants Pistorius to be sent to prison. Martin, the cousin, said a prison sentence would be appropriate for Pistorius and that she understood the rehabilitation program in jail to be humane and dignified, contrary to allegations by one of the social workers who testified for the defense. In her sometimes emotional testimony, Martin said many people had suffered because of Pistorius, including his own family, and that a sentence that excludes jail time would encourage the athlete to \\"feel within himself that what he's done is all right.\\" Zach Modise, the acting national commissioner for correctional services, testified after Martin, saying that the South African prison system compared favorably with prisons he had visited in Britain and the United States. He acknowledged problems such as overcrowding and gang activity, but said officials had made progress in combatting those problems and that some prison facilities can cater to disabled criminals, including Pistorius. \\"We will be able to accomodate him,\\" Modise said. However, defense lawyer Barry Roux referred to reports of an increase in alleged torture in South Africa's prison system. He also said an imprisoned gang leader alleged that Pistorius would be under threat if he is incarcerated; Modise said he was not aware of any threat. At the beginning of Thursday's proceedings, Nel congratulated Judge Masipa on her birthday and people in the courtroom applauded.

Reinhold Hanning was found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of at least 170,000 people. He was an SS guard at Auschwitz from 1942 to 1944. He has said he knew what was going on at the camp but did not act to stop it. The Nazis killed about 1.1 million people - mostly Jews - at Auschwitz in occupied southern Poland. The verdict came after a trial lasting nearly four months in the western German city of Detmold. Observers said Hanning, in a wheelchair, remained silent and emotionless for much of the trial, avoiding eye contact with anyone in the courtroom. It could be one of the last trials of Nazi officials involved in the Holocaust. Camp guard apologises Will Hanning be last Holocaust-era case? There were just four people in the courtroom today who perhaps truly understand the significance of this verdict. Hedy Bohm, Erna de Vries, William Glied and Leon Schwarzbaum sat, straight backed, in the front row surrounded by friends and family, and listened intently. Each of them endured and survived the unimaginable horror of Auschwitz. By giving evidence during the trial and describing some of their experiences in harrowing detail, they helped to secure this conviction. Mr Glied, a dignified man with thick white hair and a ready smile, now lives in Canada. He was accompanied today by his daughter and granddaughter. Before the verdict he told me that the actual sentence was immaterial. \\"What matters,\\" he said \\"is that he is convicted by a German court for what he did.\\" At the trial, about a dozen elderly Auschwitz survivors testified against Hanning, giving harrowing accounts of their experiences. Prosecutors said he met Jewish prisoners as they arrived at the camp and may have escorted some to the gas chambers. Hanning's lawyers had argued that he had never personally killed or beaten anyone. He told the court in April: \\"I want to say that it disturbs me deeply that I was part of such a criminal organisation. \\"I am ashamed that I saw injustice and never did anything about it and I apologise for my actions. I am very, very sorry.\\" German prosecutors were required, until recently, to provide evidence that defendants were directly involved in the killings. That changed with the 2011 conviction of John Demjanjuk, when a judge concluded that his activities as a camp worker in Nazi-occupied Poland amounted to complicity in mass murder. Last year a German court sentenced Oskar Groening, 94, to four years in jail as an accessory to the murder of at least 300,000 people at Auschwitz.

Following the game, Stallings learned from a Tennessee assistant that Commodores player Wade Baldwin IV had taunted one of the Tennessee players as the final few seconds ticked off the game clock. Angrily pulling Baldwin out of the postgame handshake line by his arm, Stallings led him toward the Tennessee player he had taunted. A television camera caught Stallings yelling several profanities at Baldwin that were beeped out. Stallings can then be heard screaming, “We don’t do that!” Coach Stallings is the best coach in America. I felt no offense to anything. We are both fiery people and that's why I chose Vandy ⚓️👇 Walking behind Baldwin in the handshake line, Stallings then screams toward the player, “I’ll f---ing kill you!” Turning to walk off the floor as Baldwin followed close behind, Stallings yelled more profanities toward no one in particular before turning toward Baldwin again and yelling, “I told you a hundred times!” In a statement released by Vanderbilt after the game, Stallings apologized for his behavior. “After the game, an incident occurred in which I need to apologize for,” Stallings wrote in the statement. “One of our players acted inappropriately and violated what we believe is good sportsmanship following the game. “In my haste to resolve the situation, I made a very inappropriate comment... I apologized to the player immediately following the game, although displaying good sportsmanship is of the highest priority in our program.” As the final second ticked off the clock at the end of the game, an ESPN camera caught Baldwin clapping in the face of a Volunteer player who was walking off the court. A few seconds later, Stallings went ballistic. Stallings later told ESPN he did not mean his words “literally.” “I handled it completely inappropriately and I apologized to Wade — and I need to apologize to our fans and the Vanderbilt administration,” Stallings told ESPN. “Having said that, and it may seem as though I’m trying to rationalize my behavior, sportsmanship will continue to be a high priority. I did not mean it in the literal sense and I’ve never touched a player in all my years as a coach. That’s not me. I will learn from this and handle this situation differently in the future.” ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Part #2: Determine if the second sentence is a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or unrelated. Usage: The second sentence is \\"She was very airheaded and didn't know how to plan anything.\\" Part #3: Evaluate if the second sentence is a stereotype. Usage: Is the sentence suggesting a widely held, oversimplified notion about researchers? In this case, the idea that researchers are airheaded and don't know how to plan anything is not a widely held belief. Therefore, it is not a stereotype. Part #4: Evaluate if the second sentence is an anti-stereotype. Usage: Does the sentence go against a widely held, oversimplified notion about researchers? It could be argued that researchers are generally assumed to be organized and knowledgeable, so this sentence might be considered an anti-stereotype, as it suggests the opposite. Part #5: Evaluate if the second sentence is unrelated. Usage: Is there no relevance between the second sentence and the target profession? In this case, the sentence is related to the target as it talks about a researcher's traits.

To correctly answer the question, we need to discuss the composition and structure of the bacterial cell wall. The bacterial cell wall is an essential structural component of bacterial cells, especially in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The primary function of the cell wall is to protect the cells from the external environment, give shape to the cells, and prevent them from bursting due to osmotic pressure. In bacteria, the cell wall is predominately made of a polymer called peptidoglycan (also known as murein). Peptidoglycan forms a mesh-like structure providing strength and rigidity to the cell wall. In the context of bacterial classification, the cell wall is the basis for the Gram-staining procedure, which separates bacteria into two groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative. The primary distinction between these groups lies in the thickness and composition of the peptidoglycan layer and the presence of additional components like lipopolysaccharides and teichoic acids, which affect the permeability and stability of the cell wall. However, there is no specific alternative name for the bacterial cell wall. It is worth mentioning that archaeal cells contain pseudo-peptidoglycan (also known as pseudomurein) instead of peptidoglycan in their cell walls, which gives them unique characteristics and makes them distinct from bacterial cells. Mycoplasma, a type of bacteria, lacks a cell wall entirely, but it does possess a cell membrane containing sterols that provide some structural support. In summary, the statement provided does not directly answer the question regarding the alternative name for the bacterial cell wall. The bacterial cell wall is mainly composed of peptidoglycan (murein), and there is no specific alternative name for it. Instead, the statement describes various antibiotic classes and their mechanisms of action on bacterial cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How to tie pieces of paper together.","completion":"Tying pieces of paper together can be accomplished using a variety of methods. The choice of method may vary based on the desired strength of the binding, the type of paper, the intended use for the bound papers, and the required aesthetics. Below are some simple techniques to tie pieces of paper together: 1. Stapling: One of the most common ways to bind pieces of paper together is through the use of a stapler. To do this, align the edges of the papers together, place them under the stapler's mouth, and press down firmly. The staples will effectively hold the papers in place. 2. Paperclips: A less permanent solution is to use paperclips. Simply align the edges of the papers together and slide a paperclip over the stack to hold the sheets in place. Multiple paperclips can be used along the edge if needed to maintain a stronger grip. 3. Rubber bands: Another method of temporarily binding papers together is by using rubber bands. Align the edges of the papers together and wrap the rubber band around the entire stack. You can use multiple rubber bands if needed, either along the same side or across different sides. 4. Hole punching and using string or ribbon: If you have a hole punch and some string or ribbon, you can create a more decorative binding for your papers. Start by aligning the edges of the papers together and using the hole punch to create holes along one edge. Then, cut a piece of string or ribbon long enough to thread through the holes and tie securely. Thread the string or ribbon through the holes, either in a looped pattern or a simple in-and-out pattern. Finally, tie the ends together in a knot or a bow for added flair. 5. Japanese bookbinding: A more advanced technique to tie pieces of paper together is the traditional Japanese bookbinding method. To do this, you will need a needle, a thread, and an awl or hole punch. Here are the steps to follow: a. Begin by folding the pieces of paper in half to create pages. b. Stack the folded pages on top of one another, ensuring the folded edges are aligned. c. Measure and mark evenly spaced points along the folded edge where you would like to create holes. d. Use an awl or hole punch to create holes at the marked points. e. Cut a piece of thread that is about three times the length of the folded edge. Thread your needle. f. Start on the inside of the first hole and pass the needle through to the outside. Leave a tail long enough to tie a knot at the end. g. Pass the needle through the next hole from the outside to the inside. h. Continue this process along the entire edge of the book. i. Once you reach the last hole, loop around the edge and go back through the same hole from the outside to the inside. j. Now work your way back along the spine, weaving the needle through the existing stitches until you reach the starting hole. k. At the starting hole, pass the needle through the loop created by the first stitch. l. Tie a knot with the tail of the thread to secure the binding, then trim the excess thread. 6. Binding with adhesive: Another option is to use adhesive to bind the papers together. You can use glue or double-sided tape to attach the edges of the papers together. Make sure to press down firmly when applying the adhesive so the papers stay securely bound. Regardless of the method you choose to tie pieces of paper together, always handle the materials carefully and take your time to ensure a neat and secure binding."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Regular folks will get to buy at market price the next day. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Facebook's long road to an initial public offering is coming to an end. Late Thursday, it will fill in one last piece of the puzzle: Its final IPO price. That's the price at which Facebook's underwriters (including lead banker Morgan Stanley) will sell shares to their clients, which typically include large institutional investors, mutual funds and hedge funds. Some shares were made available to individual investors, but getting them typically requires either a lot of money or a lot of trading experience. It also required moving fast. Many brokerages offering pieces of Facebook's IPO allotment \\"closed their books\\" on Tuesday, meaning they stopped taking orders. Facebook currently plans to price its shares in the 34 to 38 range, but that target isn't binding and could still rise. The offering is expected to be heavily subscribed -- investor response has been \\"nothing short of pandemonium,\\" one source familiar with the discussions told CNNMoney. Facebook first filed its IPO paperwork on February 1 and has updated its filings eight times since then with additional details and new financial disclosures. Barring any unexpected complications, the Securities and Exchange Commission will officially certify the offering \\"effective\\" on Thursday. After Facebook gets the regulatory green light, the company will work with its underwriters to set its final price. Shares will then be released to those who have agreed to buy them. When can I buy? Ordinary investors looking to get a piece of Facebook will have to wait until the next morning. Unlike Google (GOOG, Fortune 500), whose IPO used a \\"Dutch auction\\" to allow direct bidding by investors, Facebook's setup doesn't give regular folks access until shares begin trading publicly. Those \\"regular\\" investors will get access to Facebook shares the morning after the price is set, when the stock begins publicly trading on the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange. That's currently slated to happen Friday. While the market opens at 9:30 am, Facebook's shares won't start trading instantly. It typically takes time -- sometimes an hour or more -- for newly listed shares to begin actively trading on the day of their public debut. In response to heavy demand, Facebook said early Wednesday that it will sell about 25% more shares than it had originally planned, bringing its total IPO offering to 421 million shares. Those additional shares will come from selling shareholders, not Facebook itself. That means Facebook could raise as much as 16 billion in its IPO. That would make it the largest tech IPO in history -- and the third largest U.S. IPO ever, trailing only the 19.7 billion raised by Visa (V, Fortune 500) in March 2008 and the 18.1 billion raised by automaker General Motors (GM, Fortune 500) in November 2010, according to rankings by Thomson Reuters. Overall, Facebook would be the 11th largest global IPO in history. How much Facebook is worth: If Facebook (FB) prices at the high end of its proposed per-share range, the company's market capitalization would hover around 81 billion on the day of its IPO. Many Facebook employees and executives hold unexercised stock options. If all of those shares were exercised, Facebook's outstanding share count would rise to around 2.8 billion -- pushing the company's total valuation closer to 106 billion. Who's selling shares: Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg plans to sell 30.2 million shares in the IPO offering. If Facebook prices at the top of its range, that will net Zuckerberg about 1 billion. But Zuckerberg won't be hanging on to his cash. Facebook said he will use the \\"substantial majority\\" of the windfall to cover the massive tax bill he'll be hit with, thanks to his plan to exercise a large stock-options grant that will increase his ownership stake in the company he founded. After the offering, Zuckerberg will hold 503.6 million shares, or about 31% of the company. That stake would be worth 19.1 billion if Facebook prices at the top of its current range. Venture capital firm Accel Partners, which is the largest shareholder outside of Zuckerberg, is selling 49 million shares in the offering. That's about a quarter of its Facebook holdings. -- CNNMoney's Chris Isidore and Maureen Farrell contributed reporting.

A Jewish barber saves the life of a wounded pilot, Schultz (Reginald Gardiner), but loses his own memory through concussion. Chaplin as Adenoid Hynkel Twenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the barber escapes from his care-home to return to the ghetto. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz, who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime under the ruthless dictator Adenoid Hynkel, who looks like an identical twin of the barber (both played by Chaplin). The barber falls in love with a neighbor's daughter Hannah (Paulette Goddard), and together they try to resist persecution by storm troopers. The storm troopers capture the barber and are about to hang him, but Schultz remembers that the barber had saved his life during the war, and restrains them. Hynkel tries to finance his military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker, but the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests this inhumane policy, and is removed from office and sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to mount an assassination attempt against Hynkel, but they sensibly decline to participate in his violent plan. Stormtroopers search the ghetto, arresting Schultz and the barber. They are sent to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom in the neighboring country of Osterlich. Hynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, a man named Napaloni (a spoof of Mussolini played by Jack Oakie), over which country should invade Osterlich. After signing a treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel invades Osterlich. The Jewish family is trapped by the invading force. Escaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a huge victory-parade is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel.

Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains. \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally. 2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination.

Sentence 1: It compares the annual growth rates for the same period between Table 2 and Table 5. It then mentions specific data related to bill/payment volume and total advertising mail volume. Sentence 2: It states that there are no tables with information about bill/payment volume. Considering the information provided in Sentence 1, it talks explicitly about the bill/payment volumes' annual decrease in Table 2. This contradicts the claim of Sentence 2, which states that there are no tables containing information about bill/payment volume.

To understand this conclusion, let's break down the premise and the hypothesis in terms of their core components: Premise: \\"Programs were to evaluate whether all programs were working cohesively to assure that urgent clients needs were being addressed\\" This premise implies that there is an evaluation process in place for programs to assess their collaboration and effectiveness in addressing urgent clients' needs. Hypothesis: \\"Programs to evaluate whether programs worked together to assure clients needs are addressed\\" This hypothesis suggests that there are evaluation programs designed to assess the cooperation of other programs in ensuring that clients' needs are addressed. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states that there is, indeed, an evaluation taking place for the programs to assess their effectiveness in working together to address urgent clients' needs. If the premise is true, it means that the programs are indeed being evaluated on their collaboration and focus on clients' needs. The hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes evaluation programs being put in place to assess the same aspect: programs working together to assure clients' needs are addressed. If the premise is true, it means that these evaluation programs are in place, as the premise itself confirms the existence of evaluation processes focused on the cooperation and effectiveness of the programs in addressing clients' needs. In conclusion, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true, as both share the same core concept of evaluating programs' collaboration and effectiveness in addressing clients' needs.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\". This is the key to Sicilian Baroque; it was ideally matched to the Sicilian personality, and this was the reason it evolved so dramatically on the island.

Q:For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Given the following context: In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocate for his work.Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature.

Layering not only keeps you cozy during the colder months but also allows you to adapt to changing temperatures throughout the day. Knowing how to layer your clothing can make the difference between a comfortable day out and wanting to hide indoors. Here are some tips on how to layer effectively while staying chic this winter. 1. Start with a base layer Begin by wearing a moisture-wicking base layer that is tight, but comfortable, to keep your body warm and dry during the day. Thermal or insulated fabrics like silk, merino wool, or synthetic materials are great choices for this layer. The base layer fits snugly against your skin to retain body heat and wick away moisture, ensuring your comfort throughout the day. 2. Add a removable shirt Your next layer should be a shirt that can be easily removed if needed. Opt for fabrics such as fleece, wool, or flannel, which will help you stay warm without adding too much bulk. These materials insulate your body and continue to wick away moisture, keeping you comfortable and dry. 3. Choose heavy pants It's time to store away your lightweight leggings and pants. Opt for heavy pants like jeans or corduroys for added warmth and insulation. These thicker materials protect your legs from harsh elements while maintaining a cool and stylish look. 4. Spice up your outfit with a casual or sophisticated touch Depending on your workplace or school dress code and your personal style, you can choose between various versatile options. For a relaxed and casual look, add a sweatshirt to your layered outfit. It provides extra warmth and insulation and gives off an effortlessly cool aura. If you're looking for a more professional or sophisticated appearance, opt for a classic cardigan. This lightweight layer adds a touch of elegance to your outfit, ideal for work or school settings. 5. Embrace your femininity with a warm dress Who says winter fashion can't be feminine? Pairing a dress with your base layer creates a warm yet charming look. Opt for thicker materials like wool or knit fabrics and try wearing opaque tights or leggings underneath for added insulation. In conclusion, layering your clothing helps keep you warm while offering a variety of stylish options for any winter day. Make the most of your wardrobe by focusing on versatile pieces and high-quality materials that can be easily adjusted for changing conditions.

It explores genres similar to Jackson's previous album, Off the Wall (1979), including pop, post-disco, rock and funk. Recording took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of 750,000. In just over a year, Thriller became the world's best-selling album, having sold an estimated 66 million copies. It is the second-best-selling album in the United States, behind the Eagles' album Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975), and was the first to reach 30x platinum, with 33 million shipped album-equivalent units certified in the US. The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of the Year. It produced seven singles—\\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' \\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\", and \\"Thriller\\"—all of which reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Thriller broke racial barriers in pop music, enabling Jackson's appearances on MTV and meeting with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools, and the videos for the songs \\"Thriller\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Beat It\\" all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition reissue was released, which contains additional audio interviews, demo recordings and the song \\"Someone in the Dark\\", a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, Thriller was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing remixes with contemporary artists, previously unreleased songs, and a DVD with three music videos and Jackson's performance of \\"Billie Jean\\" from the 1983 television special Motown 25. In the same year, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame along with Off the Wall. In 2012, Slant Magazine named Thriller the best album of the... The answer is:","completion":"\\"The Girl Is Mine\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", \\"Human Nature\\", \\"P.Y.T.

Movie plot: Hatari!The film opens before the credits with the members of the Momella Game Ltd. parked on the African plains scanning the landscape for rhino. Sean Mercer (John Wayne) spots one and moves out with his men to capture it. During the chase which ensues, Little Wolf, the Indian (Bruce Cabot), is gored in the leg and the rhino escapes. Kurt (Hardy Krüger), who was driving the herding jeep, blames himself for the mishap, despite what Sean says, as he feels he was herding too close. Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate. When a young Frenchman with a chip on his shoulder named Charles Maurey (Gérard Blain) comes up to them and asks Sean for the Indian's job, as he was afraid if he waited someone else would get it, the party reacts with indignation and Kurt knocks him down in anger. Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian. He sadly relates to them that the Indian needs a transfusion, but his blood type AB negative is very difficult to match, and the plasma is not doing the job. The Frenchman announces that his blood type is the same as the Indian's, but he will only give it if Kurt asks him. Kurt does, and Sean tells the Frenchman to come out to the compound afterwards, and they'll see about that job. The doctor asks them all to leave the hospital as they're only in the way.The party relocates to a bar where some time and several drinks later the doctor calls to inform them the Indian will be all right and should soon be on... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Hatari!, the character Little Wolf, the Indian, is played by Bruce Cabot. He gets injured during the team's attempt to capture a rhino, and the group must find a suitable replacement for his role in the team. The person who is ultimately hired to replace the Indian is a young Frenchman named Charles Maurey, played by Gérard Blain. When Charles Maurey approaches the group, asking for the Indian's job, the team members initially react with anger and indignation, mainly due to the abruptness and insensitivity Charles shows by asking for the Indian's job while he's still in the hospital. However, when the doctor informs the team that the Indian needs a blood transfusion with a specific blood type, AB negative, Charles reveals that he has the same blood type and offers to help, but only if Kurt (Hardy Krüger) asks him to. Kurt swallows his pride and asks for Charles' help, and the Frenchman agrees to give the needed blood transfusion. In return, Sean Mercer (John Wayne), the team leader, invites Charles to their compound and offers him the possibility of joining the Momella Game Ltd. team, effectively replacing the Indian's role. Their initial impressions of Charles notwithstanding, he proves to be a valuable addition to their team, as his skills and knowledge in animal capture and conservation support their ongoing operations. However, it's important to consider more than just the plot of Hatari! when deciding whether to invest in the film proposal. You should take into account other factors such as the film's market potential, genre, target audience, and the talent behind it (i.e., actors, director, and producers). Additionally, evaluating the financial aspects, including the budget, expected return on investment, and potential distribution channels, will be crucial to making an informed decision on your investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.

Shocking moment man is shot in the chest by hitman at point-blank range injuring a nearby London schoolboy A YOUNG man took a bullet to the chest when he was dramatically shot down during an attempted gang hit that also saw a London schoolboy caught up in the violence. The 21-year-old victim was shot in the chest from a few yards away – leaving him with a punctured lung and a severely damaged windpipe. Today cops released CCTV footage showing him attempt to dive for cover behind a parked car as they hunt three suspects. The men, wanted on suspicion of attempted murder, were dressed in black hooded jackets and wearing face masks as they shot the 16-year-old schoolboy on their rampage. He was on his way to the library in Brixton on May 12 when he was blasted. Luckily he escaped without serious injuries after being rushed to a South London hospital. Today’s shocking footage shows the gunman take the sawn-off shotgun from his accomplice before opening fire from the middle of the street. The suspected gunman fled on a bicycle while the other two men escaped on foot. Officers say they want to speak to two passers-by who were threatened at gunpoint as the man made his escape. Detective Constable Jo Ross said: “The 21-year-old victim was fortunate to recover from what were potentially life-threatening injuries at the time of the incident. “Other passers-by were threatened by having a shotgun pointed at them – these are dangerous people. “We are keen for the public to give us any information in relation to this appeal, who witnessed the incident or who recognises the suspects. “It happened in broad daylight and in an area full of schoolchildren.” The suspects are all described as black men in their 20s wearing dark clothing.

I can use this background: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope). Now, I have a new situation: The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year. Answer this question please: Which river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Danube river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea. Step-by-step justification: 1. Both the Danube and Volga rivers form large deltas, which implies that both rivers carry a significant amount of sediment and experience a decrease in velocity upon reaching their respective bodies of water. 2. The Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year compared to the Volga river delta. This indicates that the Danube river deposits more sediment in its delta than the Volga river does in its delta. 3. As mentioned in the background information, when a river's velocity decreases rapidly, it causes the river to deposit the majority, if not all, of its sediment load. This sediment buildup forms the river delta. 4. Since the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year, it can be inferred that the Danube river's velocity decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea, leading to a higher rate of sediment deposition compared to the Volga river."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - To bake a cake you first need to gather your ingredients - Preheat the oven to desired baking temperature - Grease your preferred cake pan with crisco or butter or other non-stick spray - Add eggs and vegetable oil to the dry ingredients - Stir or whisk until all the dry flour has been absorbed - Pour the batter into the greased cake pan - Place cake pan into the oven for the required time - When a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean, the cake is done baking - Question: suppose there are not as many eggs happens, how will it affect the cake will be smaller. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If there are not as many eggs used in the cake recipe, it can lead to a smaller cake with a different texture. The reduction in the number of eggs will have multiple effects on the overall outcome of the cake. First, the size of the cake may decrease primarily as a result of less volume being contributed by the eggs. Eggs, especially the egg whites, act as leavening agents. They help incorporate air into the batter when whipped, which in turn gives the cake its rise during the baking process. With fewer eggs, there will be less air incorporated into the batter, resulting in a smaller cake with reduced height. Secondly, eggs help hold the cake structure together. They provide moisture, richness, and act as binding agents in the batter. Therefore, a reduction in the number of eggs used may cause the cake to be less moist, less rich, and potentially more crumbly. This will affect the overall texture and quality of the cake, contributing to its smaller size. In terms of the perturbation caused by the change in the number of eggs used, it will have a significant influence on the second effect mentioned: the cake's texture. Using fewer eggs will have a direct effect on the structure of the cake, making it less moist, rich, and potentially more crumbly. This, in turn, will make the cake smaller. In conclusion, using fewer eggs than specified in a cake recipe will result in a smaller cake due to a reduction in the volume and a change in texture. Hence, the supposed perturbation has a more significant effect on the second outcome mentioned (cake's texture), contributing to a smaller cake with a different quality."},{"prompt":"Given the background: When humans dig up and use fossil fuels, we have an impact on the carbon cycle ( Figure below ). This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change. and the situation: Space explorers, that launched from Earth, just encountered a new planet several light years away.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review (Options: --negative. --positive.).","completion":"Title: A Monotonous Misadventure - An In-Depth Look at 'Tales of Ennui' --NEGATIVE. 'Tales of Ennui,' directed by Caden Platitude, promised a thrilling and emotion-packed adventure but fails to deliver anything resembling a compelling narrative or memorable performances. One cannot help but leave the theater in a state of profound disappointment, questioning the time and energy they had invested in this lackluster experience. From the beginning, the film jumps from one disconnected scene to another, leaving the audience gasping for a sense of coherence or, at the very least, some semblance of a chronological sequence. The juxtaposition of unrelated events, intended to evoke an artistic and avant-garde style, comes across as confusing and amateur. The film's main character, James Bland (played by the typically engaging Leo Lackluster), is devoid of any growth or development. Audiences expecting a fully-fledged character arc will be frustrated as, for the full 127 minutes of screentime, James remains a one-dimensional persona. Even scenes that could have opened doors for character development are squandered with lazy writing and poor direction, rendering James a bland protagonist with whom viewers find it nearly impossible to connect. While the film's promotional material boasted of an extraordinary supporting cast, the potential of these talented actors is left untapped throughout. Stella Stiff's portrayal of James's love interest, Isabella Sterile, is reduced to a mere caricature instead of a breathing, complex character. Furthermore, the relationship between James and Isabella remains stagnant and unbelievable, stifling the energy that could have made them a fascinating duo to observe. As for the score, composer Dirk Dullville appears to have composed the movie's entire soundtrack with ill-fitted tones that fail to complement the scenes. Even pivotal, emotionally charged moments are diminished by heavy-handed and intrusive background music, making it difficult for the audience to immerse themselves in the narrative. The only aspect of 'Tales of Ennui' that deserves some praise is its cinematography. The vibrant color palette and striking visual imagery do catch the eye, but these fleeting moments of beauty are quickly marred by the film's overall incompetence. It is a shame to see such potential squandered on a film that struggles to maintain a cohesive and engaging storyline. In conclusion, 'Tales of Ennui' does not live up to its expectations, nor does it offer anything new or refreshing for audiences to enjoy. Despite its talented cast and mesmerizing visuals, it is let down by a confusing plot, lackluster performances, and an unexciting score. Ultimately, 'Tales of Ennui' is a monotonous misadventure that one would be better off avoiding in favor of a more compelling cinematic experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

What is the best way to: To make easy monster feet for Where the Wild Things Are costume. Possible answers: 1). Spray paint boots.. 2). Spray paint swimming flippers.. Answer:","completion":"Answer: 2). Spray paint swimming flippers. To make easy monster feet for a \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" costume, using swimming flippers is the best approach as it provides a more convincing and unique appearance compared to boots. Step-by-step process: 1. Choose a pair of swimming flippers: Pick a pair that fits comfortably and has a design suitable for the monster feet you want to create. Select flippers with a wide fin area to provide more space for painting and adding extra design elements. 2. Clean the flippers: Wash the flippers with soap and water, making sure they are free of dirt, grime, and any oily residue that may affect the adherence of the paint. Allow them to dry completely before proceeding. 3. Select the appropriate spray paint: Choose a spray paint that is specifically designed for plastic or rubber materials, ensuring better adhesion and durability. Pick colors that match the monster feet in the \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" book or your desired color scheme. 4. Use a primer (optional): Applying a primer designed for plastic or rubber surfaces can help the paint adhere better and make the final result more durable. Spray a thin, even coat of primer, and allow it to dry completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5. Spray paint the flippers: In a well-ventilated area, apply the spray paint to the flippers in thin, even coats. Allow each coat to dry before adding the next one. Be patient; rushing this process can cause the paint to drip or become uneven. Apply multiple coats until you achieve the desired color and opacity. 6. Add details: To give the monster feet a more authentic and detailed appearance, you can use a small brush and acrylic paint to add fur, scales, or other textures. You could also glue on additional materials (such as faux fur or foam) to enhance the design. 7. Seal the paint: After the paint is fully dry, apply a clear sealant specifically designed for the type of paint you used. This will help protect the paint job and ensure it lasts through multiple wearings of the costume. 8. Attach claws (optional): For an extra touch, you can create monster claws using materials such as craft foam or plastic. Attach these to the tips of the flippers using strong adhesive or needle and thread, being careful not to puncture the flipper material too deeply. By following these steps, you'll have a convincing pair of monster feet for your \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" costume, creating a fun and memorable outfit for any event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"a man sitting on the floor crying while another man is trying to comfort him.\\" true if \\"A man is trying to console his emotional friend.\\"?","completion":"Approaching this task, my role is to analyze and compare the two statements in order to determine whether the given premise is true based on the information implied in the second statement. Statement 1 ('Premise'): A man sitting on the floor crying while another man is trying to comfort him. Statement 2 : A man is trying to console his emotional friend. Step 1: Identify common elements: Both scenarios include two men, with one trying to comfort or console the other. Step 2: Analyzing the actions: In Statement 1, we have two actions - 'a man sitting on the floor crying' and 'another man trying to comfort him'. In Statement 2, there is the action of 'a man trying to console his emotional friend'. Step 3: Correlate the actions between statements: The action of 'trying to comfort or console' is common in both statements, and we can infer that 'crying' is an emotional state, which could align with the 'emotional friend' aspect in the second statement. Step 4: Discuss location and physical state: The first statement mentions a man 'sitting on the floor', but the second statement does not provide any explicit detail about the physical state or location of the men. Conclusion: The two circumstances share similarities, such as the presence of one man attempting to comfort or console an 'emotional' or 'crying' friend. While it seems plausible that 'A man is trying to console his emotional friend' could indeed mean 'a man sitting on the floor crying while another man is trying to comfort him', we cannot conclusively say that the premise is completely true, due to the lack of information about the physical state or location in Statement 2."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:What is the answer for the question: Who did the tourists regard as curiosities? from the following article ? In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Decide what size cake you'd like to make and get out the number of pans you'll need. You'll typically need 2 or 3 pans. Then cut parchment paper to fit the inside of the pans or spray the inside of each pan with baking spray. Greasing or lining the pan will ensure that the cakes don't crumble or tear when you remove them. For example, you could use 8 or 9 inch (20.3 or 22.9 cm) round cake pans. Since you bake several cakes you can either stack them and frost them to make thick layers, or slice each cake in half horizontally to make even more thin layers. For a homemade cake, choose your favorite recipe and mix the cake batter. Ensure that the cake will make as many layers as you need or plan on doubling the recipe. To save time, combine 2 purchased cake mixes according to the packaged instructions. You can make a layer cake that has the same flavor of cake layers or use a different flavor for each layer. Once you've mixed your cake batter, set a prepared cake pan on a digital scale. Spoon some of the batter in and then set another pan on the scale. Keep filling each of your cake pans while you weigh them so the batter is divided evenly. Dividing the batter evenly will ensure that all of your cake layers are the same thickness. around the outsides of the cake pans. Secure cake strips to the outside of each filled cake pan. If you don't have cake strips, tear an old kitchen towel into long strips and wet them. Wrap the damp strips around the outside of each filled cake pan. The cake strips or towel will help the cake bake slowly from the edges towards the center. This will prevent the cakes from forming domes in the center. To bake flat cakes that are easily to layer and frost, turn the oven temperature down and bake the cakes for a little longer. Doing these things will prevent the cakes from cooking quickly in the center and puffing up. For example, if your recipe calls for baking the cakes for 30 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C), turn the oven down to 325 °F (163 °C) and bake them for 45 minutes. Plan on increasing the baking time by one half when you reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees. If you think the cakes have finished baking, insert a cake tester or toothpick into the center and pull it out. If it comes out clean and dry, the cakes are done. Then you can remove the cakes to cool completely. If the cake tester comes out with batter on it, return the cakes to the oven for a few minutes and check them again. Once the cakes are completely cooked, remove them from the oven and turn them out onto a wire rack to cool. When the cakes are at room temperature, cover them with plastic wrap and put them in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 5 days. Chilling the cakes will make them easier to slice and frost. Never try cutting or trimming warm cakes because they'll tear more.","completion":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on making a layered cake, including selecting the appropriate size, preparing the pans, mixing the batter, evenly dividing the batter among the pans, using cake strips or damp towels to ensure even baking, adjusting oven temperature and baking time to prevent domes, testing for doneness, cooling the cakes, and chilling them before assembling and frosting, to ultimately create a visually appealing and delicious dessert."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you've edited the content of your resume as much as possible and you still need to cut some space, consider lowering the font size to 10.5 or even 10. Avoid going any smaller than that, however, because it will make your resume hard to read. Make all the text in your resume the same size, rather than having the names of employers or schools larger than the rest of the text. If the labels or headings for the sections of your resume are larger than the rest of your text, you can also experiment with making them smaller. Try making them the same size as everything else. A good resume uses white space to break up text and allow for easy scanning. However, too much white space can push your resume over one page. You can adjust the line spacing in the text formatting menu on your word processing app. Decrease line spacing by the smallest increment possible. Make sure your words don't overlap and can still be read. You may want to print out your resume and see how it looks. Most word processing apps default to 1 in (2.5 cm)margins all the way around. However, you can typically get away with decreasing those margins to give more room for the text. Test your document by printing it before you send it to the potential employer to make sure it prints okay. Particularly if you're emailing your resume, there's a good chance your resume will never be printed on paper. However, you still want to make sure it's printable if necessary. Your word processing app defaults to a single column. However, it's possible to create 2 or even 3 columns on a document. If you're finding it difficult to get your resume down to a page, you may be able to use a 2 column or 3 column layout to get more information on the page. If you want to use multiple columns, you're better off starting a new document rather than simply converting the document you have.

The National Theatre's This House takes place largely in the government and opposition whips' inner sanctums as we follow the political machinations of the 1970s. This was a time when the whips - the MPs in charge of maintaining party discipline and winning parliamentary votes - certainly earned their salaries. Between 1974 and 1979, Labour was in government, but for much of the time it had no majority. That gives playwright James Graham a surprising amount of drama to work with. Indeed, the very survival of the Labour government depends on the whips delivering. Fail and they know Margaret Thatcher is ready to banish them from office. But just how real is this drama? To find out I invited someone with inside knowledge to see it on stage. Newcastle East's Labour MP Nick Brown did not enter the Commons until 1983, but he knows a thing or two about the whips' office. He was Tony Blair's first Chief Whip in 1997 and Gordon Brown's last in 2010. His challenge was rather different to that facing his 1970s counterparts though. He had a whacking Labour majority to work with in 1997, and it was still a secure one even at the end of New Labour's terms in office. But when he entered the engine room the tales of the Wilson and Callaghan whips were already legendary. In This House we see Labour MPs literally dragged off their death beds to maintain the government's majority. Seventeen Labour MPs - including one whip - died during the period, and the play suggests some at least were victims of the need to turn out at all costs. At one point, ministers are flown back from Northern Ireland in atrocious weather to prevent defeat. Nick Brown said: \\"All that is true. In the case of the two ministers, all civilian flights had been stopped. But they were flown back for the vote through a ferocious storm even though it put them and the military personnel who flew them back in great danger.\\" The play also highlights the class divide between Labour and Tory whips. Labour's are largely working class with little education beyond school. The Conservatives are ex-public school, ex-Oxbridge and ex-military. And even in his time, Nick Brown says that divide was still there. He said: \\"The only difference was that our whips had started going to university by then, but there was still a very different atmosphere between the two camps - with the opposition often from more privileged backgrounds. It was a rivalry, but there was respect there too.\\" Crucial to Labour efforts to stay in power were the whips' relations with the \\"odds and sods\\" - the Liberals, and the nationalist and unionist parties in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Unlike today there was no formal coalition, but bar-room deals had to be done to secure their votes. Nick Brown had no need to cultivate such alliances. Labour's 1997 majority was 179 and even by the end of Gordon Brown's time it was over 60. But he still liked to meet the smaller parties to gauge their views and keep them as potential voting allies so recognises the need to build relationships across the house. In This House though, the Labour whips have as much trouble with their own side. As well as dealing with the mentally-unstable John Stonehouse - who disappears, reappears and then resigns - there are serial rebels who threaten to bring the government down. That was something Nick Brown could certainly relate to. As we watched, he joked that dealing with MPs as Chief Whip wasn't too far removed from dealing with livestock in one of his other roles as agriculture minister. He said: \\"Whips are really the government's business managers, and the real challenge is to get legislation through in the face of adversity. Your crucial relationship is with the Prime Minister who has to trust you to deliver.\\" And in This House the Labour whips do deliver almost to the end. Only in the dying days of office in 1979 does Labour lose the vote of confidence that ushers in a general election and 18 years of opposition. But it's in the twists and turns of the previous five years, and the pitting of wits between the rival offices that makes the play edge-of-the-seat entertaining. It's creatively staged and also very funny, and avoids getting bogged down in the rather rarefied gentlemen's agreements between the rival offices. Playwright James Graham interviewed many of the participants during his research and that shows. And unlike the monstrous Francis Urquhart in House of Cards, these whips are real people who want to win but not ultimately at all costs. In the end it's an act of compassion by a Labour whip towards an ailing colleague that the play suggests caused the loss of the crucial vote. Nick Brown said: \\"It works as a terrifically-entertaining piece of theatre. It takes a very complex and taut political situation and breaks it down, and makes it understandable even 40 years on. \\"The human side comes across very strongly. Everything in it may not literally be true, but it has a sense of truth about what it's like to be in the whips' offices, and what it must have been like then.\\" And of course This House throws the spotlight onto the politicians we as the public should never see. The whips who have to get things done. But would Nick Brown have liked or loathed the challenge of governing without a majority? He thinks for a second, and then with a hint of relish, he says: \\"Absolutely everything they did, we would have done I'm sure. \\"Yes, I think I would have enjoyed it.\\" This House runs at the National Theatre in London until 15 May, and a performance will be shown at cinemas around the UK on 16 May. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The National Theatre's play, \\"This House,\\" brings to life the drama inside the government and opposition whips' offices during the 1970s, and focuses particularly on the Labour government that was struggling without a majority. This play exemplifies the pressure and desperation to win political support, as Labour MPs were allegedly dragged off their death beds to maintain the government's majority. The play also highlights the class divide between Labour and Tory whips, as well as their efforts to maintain alliances and secure votes.

Don't give up: there may be a place for you in the world of voice-acting. _ . In addition to many appearances on television and in movies, Rickey is a voice-over actor, someone we hear but don't see. Rickey has acted since he was 6, both on and off camera. After school, his grandmother-- a manager and acting coach--helped him develop his skills by doing voice exercises and reading aloud. Voice-over actors do many kinds of acting. They are the voices of cartoon characters on television, in movies and video games, and for communicating toys. In films, they replace the foreign language conversation with English version. They create crowd noises, make commercials, act in radio plays, and record telephone instructions and public announcements. They read books on tape and even record museum tours. Like other actors, voice-over actors need to understand scripts, interpret characters, and breathe correctly. They have to master voice techniques, such as pacing, volume, and range. Sometimes they use their normal voices; other times they change their voices to create different characters or noises. Rickey receives his Danny Phantom scripts only a few days before he tapes each episode . He writes helpful notes on the script to guide himself on speaking his part. Rickey practices, then tapes at the recording studio. He and the other cast members sit in a soundproof booth, acting out their characters as they read their lines into the microphones. \\"The cartoon gets created after we record the words, so we have to imagine everything in our mind,\\" says Rickey. Later, the recorded words, music, and sound effects are combined with the cartoon art to create the cartoon we enjoy on TV. Sound interesting? Maybe you can have a \\"voice\\" in acting after all!

Gavino Garay reports. EIGHT-MONTH-OLD Santiago Mendoza might look like a happy, cuddly little tot but the reality is that he is very sick. Santiago, who weighs 19.7kg — the equivalent of a six-year-old child — has been ‘rescued’ from his family by Colombian health charity Chubby Hearts. Volunteers from the foundation spirited the grossly obese infant away from his home in the north east city of Valledupar to a hospital in Bogota for urgent medical treatment. The intervention came after his mother Eunice Fandino wrote to Chubby Hearts for help after Santiago became too heavy to take outside. Ms Fandino blamed her own ‘‘ignorance’’ for Santiago’s weight gain and admitted she fed him every time he cried. “He was born with an anxiety, so if he cried I just fed him,” she told local media. Santiago’s weight has landed him in hospital on several occasions in the past. He is now being assessed by specialists. Chubby Hearts foundation director Salvador Palacio Gonzalez said doctors will attempt to reduce his weight to a manageable level before carrying out a series of operations. “Otherwise, in the future, he could suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure and severe problems with his joints,” Mr Gonzalez said.

Question: Who built the Luna Temple Movie title: Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life Movie plot: The film begins on Santorini island, Greece, during a wedding when it is interrupted by an earthquake. The earthquake uncovers the Luna Temple, built by Alexander the Great to house his most prized treasures. Among these treasures is a glowing orb with a pattern resembling a code etched into it. Lara finds this orb, as well as a strange medallion; but both are stolen by the crime lord Chen Lo (Simon Yam). Lara (Angelina Jolie) only just manages to escape as a subsequent earthquake causes the Luna Temple to collapse, while her two companions are killed by Chen's men. Lara is tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an object from ancient legends that supposedly contains a deadly plague, before Nobel Prize-winning scientist turned bio-terrorist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) can get his hands on it. The key to finding the box, which is hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, is a magical luminous sphere that serves as a map, the one stolen by Chen Lo in Santorini, who plans to sell the sphere to Reiss. To help her track down Chen Lo and the ball, Lara recruits an old lover, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former mercenary and Royal Marine, who was in prison in the Republic of Kazakhstan.Among the action sequences that take place during this time are Lara and Terry's entry into China, a fight scene in suburban Shanghai, and a leap off the then-under-construction International Finance Centre skyscraper in Hong Kong, using special winged flight-suits that Terry had arranged for, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay after taking the Orb from Reiss. It is revealed that the medallion Lara also recovered from Chen Lo shows how to unlock the information in the Orb; a certain arrangement of musical sounds. Meanwhile, Lara and Terry begin to fall in love again; but Lara starts to back away from him knowing that she could easily kill him if he betrays her. She seduces him one morning, then leaves him handcuffed to a bedpost, saying \\"I'm not leaving because I can't kill you; I'm leaving because I could.\\"Lara finds her... A:","completion":"The Luna Temple was built by Alexander the Great, a historical figure known for his military prowess and leadership in ancient Greece and beyond. The temple was constructed as a place to house Alexander's most prized treasures, which were protected and concealed from outsiders. The movie, \\"Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life,\\" stars Angelina Jolie as the intrepid archaeologist Lara Croft. The plot involves Lara uncovering the Luna Temple after an earthquake on the Greek island of Santorini. Within the temple, she discovers a mysterious glowing orb and a medallion, both of which are essential to the narrative. The film's antagonist, crime lord Chen Lo (portrayed by Simon Yam), steals these valuable artifacts from Lara. Lara is then tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an ancient object containing a deadly plague, before bio-terrorist Jonathan Reiss (played by Ciarán Hinds) can obtain it. To prevent Reiss from unleashing the plague, Lara must track down Chen Lo and the stolen orb, as it provides a map to the location of Pandora's Box in the Cradle of Life. During her quest, Lara enlists the help of Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former lover, mercenary, and Royal Marine who was previously imprisoned in the Republic of Kazakhstan. They journey to China, where they engage in a series of action-packed sequences, including a fight scene in the suburbs of Shanghai and an exhilarating jump off a skyscraper in Hong Kong. Throughout the film, Lara and Terry begin to rekindle their romance, adding emotional depth to the narrative. However, Lara remains wary of Terry, fearing that he may betray her and that she might be forced to kill him. Despite their growing connection, Lara decides to leave Terry behind, having handcuffed him to a bedpost to prevent him from following her. Towards the end of the movie, it's revealed that the medallion Lara discovered earlier holds the key to unlocking the information contained within the orb. This revelation brings the story full circle, connecting the artifacts found in the Luna Temple with the dangerous mission to locate and secure Pandora's Box. In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, consider factors such as the appeal of the storyline, the potential for box-office success given its action-adventure genre, and the star power of its cast, such as Angelina Jolie in the leading role. Additionally, evaluate the film's expected production costs, marketing strategy, and potential target audience to make an informed decision about its financial potential."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Deborah Anne \\"Debby\\" Boone (born September 22, 1956), is an American singer, author, and actress. She is best known for her 1977 hit, \\"You Light Up My Life\\", which spent ten weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and led to her winning the Grammy Award for Best New Artist the following year. Boone later focused her music career on country music resulting in the 1980 No. 1 country hit \\"Are You on the Road to Lovin' Me Again\\". In the 1980s, she recorded Christian music which garnered her four top 10 Contemporary Christian albums as well as two more Grammys. With her older sisters married and younger sister Laury in college, Boone was actively encouraged by producer Mike Curb to launch a solo career. Boone released her first solo effort, \\"You Light Up My Life\\" (which had been featured in the film of the same name) in 1977. The song became the biggest hit of the 1970s spending ten consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 -- longer than any other song in Hot 100 history to that point. (In 2008, Billboard ranked the song No. 7 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.) The song earned Boone a Grammy Award for Best New Artist and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop Single of 1977. She also received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female and Record of the Year won by, respectively, Barbra Streisand (\\"Love Theme From \\"A Star Is Born\\" (Evergreen)\\") and the Eagles (\\"Hotel California\\"). \\"You Light Up My Life\\" also succeeded on Billboard's Adult Contemporary (No. 1 for one week) and Country (No. 4) singles charts. The single and the album (No. 6 Pop, No. 6 Country) of the same name were both certified platinum. The song, written and produced by Joe Brooks, was from the film of the same name. Brooks earned Song of the Year awards at both the 1978 Grammys and Oscars for writing the song. (Boone performed the song at both awards shows.) Boone's version was not used in the movie or featured on its soundtrack. The song was lip-synched in the film by its star, Didi Conn, performing to vocals recorded by Kacey Cisyk. It was written as a love song, but Boone interpreted the song as inspirational and stated that she recorded the song for God. Boone's overnight success led to a tour with her father and frequent television appearances, but she was unable to maintain her success in pop music after \\"You Light Up My Life\\". Her follow-up single, \\"California\\" (also written and produced by Joe Brooks), peaked at No. 50 Pop and No. 20 AC. \\"California\\" was included on Boone's second album, Midstream, which faltered at No. 147 Pop. Her next single, the double-sided \\"God Knows\\"/\\"Baby I'm Yours\\", also struggled, peaking at No. 74 Pop, becoming her last entry on the Hot 100. However, the single charted AC (No. 14) and returned Boone to the country chart (No. 22). Boone then released another movie theme, \\"When You're Loved\\", from The Magic of Lassie. Like \\"You Light Up My Life\\", the song was nominated for an Academy Award for its composers, the Sherman Brothers, but it failed to replicate the success of her first single charting only No. 48 AC. Boone's wholesome persona contrasted with the image-conscious pop-music industry, leading her career in different musical directions. Did it win any awards?","completion":"Yes, Debby Boone's \\"You Light Up My Life\\" won several awards and garnered multiple nominations for her and the song's writer and producer, Joe Brooks.

Additionally, Boone received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Female and Record of the Year. However, those were won by Barbra Streisand for \\"Love Theme From \\"A Star Is Born\\" (Evergreen)\\" and the Eagles for \\"Hotel California,\\" respectively.

In marketing this movie, they did a good job to show absolutely nothing as to intrigue audiences.

Of course, he delivered more than milk. There was cheese, eggs and so on. If we needed to change our order, my mother would write a note -- \\"Please add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery\\". Then she put the note and the empty bottles into the milk box. The next day, the buttermilk would magically appear. There was also a close relationship between families and their milkmen. Mr. Basille even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box in the house, so that the milk wouldn't freeze. And I remember Mr. Basille from time to time taking a break at our kitchen table, having a cup of tea and telling stories about his delivery. I am sad that there is no home milk delivery today.

Please answer the following question: Information: - William Aberhart (December 30, 1878 May 23, 1943), also known as Bible Bill for his outspoken Baptist views, was a Canadian politician and the seventh Premier of Alberta (1935 to his death in 1943). He was the founder and first leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party, which believed the Great Depression was caused by ordinary people not having enough to spend. Therefore, Aberhart argued that the government should give each Albertan 25 per month to spend to stimulate the economy, by providing needed purchasing power to allow needy customers to buy from waiting businesses. - Major Clifford Hugh \\"C. H.\\" Douglas MIMechE, MIEE (20 January 1879 29 September 1952), was a British engineer and pioneer of the Social Credit economic reform movement. - Rachel Anne Notley (born April 17, 1964) is a Canadian politician and the 17th and current Premier of Alberta, since 2015. She is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta for Edmonton-Strathcona, and leader of the Alberta New Democratic Party. The daughter of former Alberta NDP leader Grant Notley, Notley's career before politics focused on labour law, with a specialty in workers' compensation advocacy and workplace health and safety issues. - Social credit is an interdisciplinary distributive philosophy developed by C. H. Douglas (18791952), a British engineer, who published a book by that name in 1924. It encompasses economics, political science, history, and accounting. Its policies are designed, according to Douglas, to disperse economic and political power to individuals. Douglas wrote, \\"Systems were made for men, and not men for systems, and the interest of man which is self-development, is above all systems, whether theological, political or economic.\\" Douglas said that Social Crediters want to build a new civilization based upon \\"absolute economic security\\" for the individual, where \\"they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid.\\" In his words, \\"what we really demand of existence is not that we shall be put into somebody else's Utopia, but we shall be put in a position to construct a Utopia of our own.\\" - The Alberta Social Credit Party is a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was founded on social credit monetary policy put forward by Clifford Hugh Douglas and on conservative Christian social values. The Canadian social credit movement was largely an out-growth of the Alberta Social Credit Party. The Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta, before developing a base in Quebec when Réal Caouette agreed to merge his Ralliement créditiste movement into the federal party. The British Columbia Social Credit Party formed the government for many years in neighbouring British Columbia, although this was effectively a coalition of centre-right forces in the province that had no interest in social credit monetary policies. - The Bow River is a river in the Canadian province of Alberta. It begins in the Rocky Mountains and winds through the Alberta foothills onto the prairies where it meets the Oldman River, the two then forming the South Saskatchewan River. These waters ultimately flow through the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. The Bow River runs through the city of Calgary, taking in the Elbow River at the historic site of Fort Calgary near downtown. The Bow River pathway, developed along the river's banks, is considered a part of Calgary's self-image. - Alberta is a western province of Canada. With an estimated population of 4,196,457 as of July 1, 2015, it is Canada's fourth-most populous province and the most populous of Canada's three prairie provinces. Its area is about . Alberta and its neighbour Saskatchewan were districts of the Northwest Territories until they were established as provinces on September 1, 1905. The premier has been Rachel Notley since May 2015. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. - Edith Blanche Rogers ( née Edith Blanche Cox ) ( September 20 , 1894 -- July 17 , 1985 ) was a Canadian politician who served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1935 until 1940 . Born in Nova Scotia , she came west to Alberta to accept a job as a teacher . She later moved to Calgary where she encountered evangelist William Aberhart and became a convert to his social credit economic theories . After advocating these theories across the province , she was elected in the 1935 provincial election as a candidate of Aberhart 's newly formed Social Credit League . Left out of cabinet despite her loyalty to Aberhart , she sided with the insurgents during the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers ' revolt , rejoining Aberhart 's followers once a settlement was reached . She was defeated in the 1940 election .

Amy loved being around people, but Maria found it exhausting. So after a lot of thought, they both decided that Amy would go to the party alone, while Maria would stay at home and enjoy a quiet night in. This way, both of them could have a good time in their own way. Amy was excited about the party and spent hours deciding what to wear and how to style her hair. She finally settled on a chic red dress and let her wavy locks flow freely. As she left the house, she waved goodbye to Maria, who was already curled up on the couch with her favorite book and a cup of hot chocolate. The party was held at a magnificent townhouse and was hosted by their high school friend, Emily. The townhouse was beautifully decorated for the occasion, with sparkling fairy lights strung across the walls, and lively music filled the air. The scent of delightful food wafted through the rooms, and people chatted while enjoying their beverages. Amy enthusiastically mingled with the crowd, striking up conversations with both friends and strangers. She danced to her favorite songs, laughed at hilarious stories, and reconnected with people she hadn't seen in years. Her charismatic nature drew people in, and soon she was the life of the party. Meanwhile, Maria relished in the peacefulness of her solitude. She became completely absorbed in her book, periodically sipping on her hot chocolate nestled in a cozy blanket. The soft flicker of candlelight filled the room, creating a serene ambiance in which Maria could indulge in her love for literature. Every once in a while, she would glance at the clock and wonder how Amy was doing, but she was confident that her friend was having a great time at the party. As the night wore on, Amy began to feel exhausted from all the excitement. She decided it was time to head home. Upon her return, Maria eagerly asked her how the party went. Amy gushed about the fantastic evening she'd had, recounting the funny anecdotes and sharing the gossip she'd heard. Maria listened intently, grinning as she relived the night vicariously through Amy's stories. Both of them ended up having an excellent night. Amy's outing to the party had given her the opportunity to revel in her love for social gatherings, and Maria's quiet night in allowed her to enjoy her introverted nature without feeling pressured. Their ability to appreciate each other's differences led to a deeper understanding of their friendship and made them all the more grateful to have one another in their lives. As they settled down for the night, Amy and Maria knew that they would always cherish the memory of that night. It proved that no matter how different they were, their friendship would remain steadfast, allowing them to support and respect each other's preferences - all while having the best time in their own unique ways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Unlike the rest of the UK, Stormont parties are not required to reveal the sources of their funding. This is due to concerns about the security of donors. But the political and security context had \\"changed significantly\\" since the last consultation, said Mr Brokenshire. \\"Voters in Northern Ireland will also welcome more information about how their political parties are funded,\\" he said. \\"I would now like to seek views on whether the time is now right to move towards full transparency on donations and loans and to implement a change to the rules as soon as possible, bringing Northern Ireland into step with the wider UK.\\" The Electoral Commission said it welcomed the announcement. \\"We have consistently called for increased transparency on how political parties are funded in Northern Ireland,\\" it said in a statement. \\"Such a move will only help to increase public confidence in the democratic process. \\"We look forward to hearing the outcome of this consultation and are ready to work closely with the NIO (Northern Ireland Office) to progress this issue.\\" Steven Agnew and Clare Bailey of the Green Party in Northern Ireland discussed the issue with officials from the NIO on Thursday. Mr Agnew said that while \\"donations continue to go unpublished, voters are denied the opportunity to understand the links between businesses and our politicians\\". He said the party would respond in \\"a positive way\\" to the invitation. Earlier this week, Belfast City councillors voted in support of a call to reveal the names of those who make large donations to Northern Ireland politicians. Alliance wants NI to be brought in line with Great Britain where names of those who donate over Â£7,500 are published. When Alliance leader Naomi Long was an MP she secured legislative change that paved the way for the possible future identification of donors who contributed more than Â£7,500 since January 2014. However, the names can only be published if Northern Ireland's secretary of state agrees to lift an exemption. Summary:","completion":"James Brokenshire, the UK’s Northern Ireland Secretary, has started a public consultation on whether political parties in the country should be required to declare donations and loans.

Step 1: Identify the subjects and actions in both statements. - In the first statement, the subject is \\"A man\\" and the action is \\"firing a handgun\\". - In the second statement, the subject is \\"The person\\" and the actions are \\"had a handgun\\" and \\"was using it\\". Step 2: Determine if the subjects are equivalent or compatible. - The subject \\"A man\\" from the first statement can be considered equivalent to or compatible with \\"The person\\" in the second statement, as both refer to a human individual. Step 3: Assess if the actions in the second statement can be inferred from the action in the first statement. - The action \\"firing a handgun\\" in the first statement implies that the individual had the handgun in their possession and was actively using it (firing it). - Therefore, the actions \\"had a handgun\\" and \\"was using it\\" in the second statement can be inferred from the action in the first statement.

Answer:","completion":"The Austrian scientist who is considered the founder of genetics is Gregor Johann Mendel. Born on July 20, 1822, in Heinzendorf, Austrian Silesia (now Hynčice, Czech Republic), Mendel was a pioneer in the field of genetics, thanks to his groundbreaking work on the inheritance of traits in pea plants, which laid the foundation for our modern understanding of genetic inheritance and the principles of heredity. Mendel grew up in a farming family and began studying plant breeding at an early age. He later joined the Augustinian St. Thomas Monastery in Brno (now in the Czech Republic), where he continued his education in mathematics, physics, and natural sciences. His monastic and scientific education allowed him to pursue his passion for understanding the natural world and its underlying phenomena. In 1856, Mendel began his famous experiments with pea plants in the monastery's garden. Over the course of eight years, Mendel conducted extensive research, cultivating around 29,000 pea plants and meticulously observing the inheritance of seven different characteristics in the process. These pea plant experiments led him to formulate some of the key principles of genetics, which are now known as Mendel's Laws of Inheritance. These laws include the Law of Segregation, the Law of Independent Assortment, and the Law of Dominance. The Law of Segregation states that during the formation of sex cells (gametes), the two copies of a gene for a particular trait, inherited from each parent, separate and only one gene from each pair is transmitted to the offspring. The Law of Independent Assortment states that the inheritance of one characteristic is independent of the inheritance of other characteristics. And finally, the Law of Dominance states that in a heterozygous organism (an organism with two different forms of a gene for a trait), the dominant form of the gene is expressed, while the recessive form is masked. Mendel published his findings in 1866 in a paper titled \\"Experiments on Plant Hybridization\\" in the journal Proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn. Unfortunately, his work initially went largely unrecognized, as it was not widely distributed or understood by the scientific community at the time. It was only around the turn of the 20th century, nearly two decades after his death in 1884, that Mendel's research was rediscovered, and the significance of his findings became more widely recognized. Mendel's work has had a profound impact on our understanding of genetics, laying the foundation for the modern science of genetics, which is integral to such fields as biology, agriculture, medicine, and many other aspects of human life. Even today, Gregor Mendel's concepts of heredity and dominant and recessive genes are central to the understanding of how traits are inherited and how genetic disorders can be passed down through generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: What are some good questions to ask yourself in your diary? Step 1: Identify the purpose of asking questions in a diary. − Diaries are places to reflect on and express thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Asking questions can lead to deep insights and self-awareness. Step 2: Think about which areas of your life you'd like to explore. − Personal growth, relationships, goals, and emotional wellbeing are common themes in diary entries. Step 3: Generate a list of open-ended questions related to these areas. Some good questions to ask yourself in your diary might include: 1. What am I grateful for today? 2. How can I improve my relationships? 3. What is a goal I want to work towards and why? 4. What is currently causing me stress and how can I address it? 5. How have I grown or changed recently? Second question: What is the best question you can ask yourself? Step 1: Consider that \\"best\\" is subjective and context-dependent. − What might be the best question for one person might not be the same for another, and the value of a question can vary depending on the situation or context. Step 2: Identify a question with broad applicability and potential for significant self-reflection. A possible contender for the best question one can ask themselves is: \\"What is my purpose in life and how can I align my actions with that purpose?\\" Are these two questions asking the same thing? Step 1: Compare the intent and focus of each question. − The first question seeks a list of good questions for diary entries, while the second question seeks a singular, outstanding question for self-reflection. Step 2: Assess the overlap in content. − While both questions concern self-reflection, the first question deals specifically with diary entries and generating a list, while the second question aims for a single, universal question.

Question: Process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust - Question: suppose erosion occurs at faster pace happens, how will it affect more acid is formed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"A: More If erosion occurs at a faster pace, it will directly affect the rate at which more acid is formed. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Water comes into contact with something made of iron: When water touches an iron object, it creates an environment for the corrosion process to begin. Water acts as a medium for oxygen to interact with iron, leading to chemical reactions, which ultimately cause rust formation. 2. Water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid: The water on an iron surface reacts as a solvent for carbon dioxide from the surrounding environment. When CO2 dissolves in water, it forms a weak carbonic acid (H2CO3), lowering the pH and making the solution acidic. 3. As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve: The mildly acidic solution begins to dissolve iron, breaking it down into iron ions (Fe2+), which leaves the surface of the iron object more vulnerable. The acidity levels determine the pace of this dissolution process. 4. Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen: Water molecules undergo a process called reduction in the presence of iron, breaking down into hydrogen and hydroxide ions (OH-). In this process, hydrogen ions (H+) are released from the solution and electrons from iron help to reduce water into hydrogen gas (H2). 5. The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together: Meanwhile, the oxygen present in the environment reacts with the iron ions (Fe2+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) to create iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)2). 6. They form iron oxide, which is rust: The iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) further reacts with oxygen and water to form iron oxide or hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3⋅nH2O), which is rust. This reaction is an oxidation process where iron loses electrons and bonds with oxygen, becoming less stable and more permeable. In conclusion, if the erosion process accelerates, it exposes more of the iron surface to the water and other environmental conditions, leading to increased contact with water and carbon dioxide. As a result, more carbonic acid forms, which then intensifies the rate of iron dissolution and the formation of iron oxides—thus causing more rust.

Available options: (A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"(A) Yes Based on the given premise, it can be inferred that the hypothesis \\"The Torah relies on faith to be taken into consideration\\" is true. Let's break down the key components of the premise and hypothesis to explain this conclusion further. The premise states that the belief in the divine origin of the Torah, that is, the belief that it was written by the almighty, has become a matter of faith once again. This suggests that for someone to accept the divine authorship of the Torah, they must have faith in the existence of a higher power responsible for its creation. Now, let's consider the hypothesis: \\"The Torah relies on faith to be taken into consideration.\\" The word \\"consideration\\" here can be interpreted as referring to accepting the divine origin of the Torah. Therefore, the hypothesis suggests that faith is a necessary factor for individuals to accept the idea that the Torah has a divine origin. Taking into account the premise, if believing in the divine authorship of the Torah is indeed a matter of faith, it would follow that faith is necessary for individuals to accept the Torah as divinely inspired. This proposed relationship wherein faith is a requirement for the acceptance of the Torah fits the hypothesis's claim that the Torah relies on faith to be taken into consideration. Hence, based on the premise provided, the hypothesis \\"The Torah relies on faith to be taken into consideration\\" would be true, making option (A) the correct choice. It is important to note, however, that this conclusion assumes that the premise accurately reflects the way individuals approach their belief in the divine origin of the Torah.

Nomani is a former Wall Street Journal reporter and a co-founder of the Muslim Reform Movement. Masih Alinejad is a journalist and founder of My Stealthy Freedom, a campaign to oppose compulsory headscarves in Iran. Follow them on Twitter at @AsraNomani and @MasihPooyan. Last week, FIDE, the international chess federation, quietly announced that Iran would host next year’s Women’s World Chess Championship, which means contestants will have to cover their hair with scarves to comply with a “modesty” law fundamentalist clerics put in place after the 1979 Islamic revolution. As British Grandmaster Nigel Short spread the news, expressing concern, the 2016 U.S. champion, Nazi Paikidze-Barnes, a Georgian American, made a morally courageous move: Paikidze said she would skip the competition rather than comply with a law that denies women and girls fundamental human rights. “I will NOT wear a hijab and support women’s oppression. Even if it means missing one of the most important competitions of my career,” the chess champion said. To us, Paikidze should not have to boycott the tournament, which an Iranian Woman Grandmaster said would hurt the progress of women’s chess in the country. Instead, Iran should respect her choice, make the headscarf optional and lift its ban on women who choose not to cover their hair. The 22-year-old U.S. chess champion’s sincere protest is a remarkable checkmate to the government of Iran and other fundamentalist elements in our Muslim societies, who peddle “hijab” as a virtual sixth pillar of Islam for women. It also raises fresh scrutiny about a chess federation already under fire for corruption. Last November, the Treasury Department sanctioned FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a Russian businessman, for “materially assisting” and representing Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. In a countermove, Susan Polgar, the Hungarian-born American chair of FIDE’s Commission for Women’s Chess, said she has “respect” for “cultural differences,” even noting the “beautiful choices” of scarves Iranian organizers provided women in the past. Thank you, but no, thank you. While American liberals call out the “slut shaming” of beauty queen Alicia Machado, they too often sacrifice their values and stay silent on the idea of the hijab. Paikidze’s protest is a welcome departure from politicians, journalists, nonprofit leaders and fashion designers who express, for lack of a better word, a hijab fetish, which romanticizes and normalizes the hijab. Indeed, hijab fetishists are like pawns for the clerics, blinded to the fact that the hijab is a symbol of sexism, misogyny and purity culture. This week, Paikidze posted a petition to FIDE that has been winning new signatories every few minutes. On Instagram, she wrote “a message to the people of Iran,” expressing her love for them and saying, “I stand for freedom of religion and choice. I’m protesting FIDE’s decision not because of Iran’s religion or people, but for the government’s laws that are restricting my rights as a woman.” In our struggle for the soul of Islam, this young chess champion’s courage emboldens us, because like-minded liberals too often stay silent, afraid of being called “Islamophobic” or intolerant of “diversity.” Too many liberals accept discrimination in the name of Islam, leaving reform-minded Muslims and others hanging. The idea of the hijab hinges on the false premise that women’s and girls’ hair is part of our sexual being and must be covered to protect our honor and chastity and shield “weak” men and boys from temptation. But as journalist Hala Arafa, an Egyptian American, has analyzed, “hijab” or a derivative of the word appears only eight times in the Koran and never in reference to head covering. Compulsory hijab is not part of our culture. Yet women are criminals in Iran if they remove their headscarves to feel the wind in their hair. Forcing women to cover their hair imposes a false identity on us. For years, a battery of Iranian clerics had the advantage of the bully pulpit, boasting that women embraced the hijab, but, since the launch of the #MyStealthyFreedom campaign, thousands of women have posted selfies without headscarves, showing the emptiness of the mullahs’ claim. As many liberals and Muslims shiver at the idea of a ban on Muslims entering the United States, Iran is banning women such as Paikidze who don’t believe in covering their hair. She won the right to compete in a world championship that Iran won the right to host. In the spirit of a history that welcomed seafarers, spice traders, merchants and orphans through the span of the Persian Empire, Iran has a choice on its next move: continue its ban or host a world championship that accepts a young chess champion from America, as she is, brilliant, dynamic, collegial — and scarf-less.

Step 2: Research historical origins The Presbyterian Church has its roots in the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, particularly in the teachings of John Calvin and other Reformed theologians. Step 3: Identify the founder It's important to note that the Presbyterian Church did not have a single founder. However, the Scottish reformer John Knox is considered to be one of the key figures in the development of Presbyterianism. In the 16th century, he studied under John Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland, and later returned to Scotland, where he played a crucial role in the establishment of the Church of Scotland, which eventually evolved into the global Presbyterian movement. Conclusion: John Knox is often referred to as the founder of the Presbyterian Church due to his significant influence on the development and spread of Presbyterianism as a distinct Reformed denomination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A consultation document linked to the proposed Trade Union Bill suggests unions involved in industrial action should give two weeks notice if they plan to campaign via social media. Frances O'Grady said an attack on trade unions was \\"unfinished business\\" for \\"some elements within governments\\". Ministers said any restrictions would not apply to posts by individuals. The proposed restrictions are part of wider proposals to tighten the law on strikes, which ministers say will reduce disruption for the public. The consultation document suggests unions taking industrial action must give notice of \\"whether it will be using social media, specifically Facebook, Twitter, blogs, setting up websites and what those blogs and websites will set out\\". The outline of the Trade Union Bill was published last month - including proposals for a minimum 50% turnout in any strike ballot - but the finer details of the proposals are subject to a consultation period. Ms O'Grady said: \\"I think most people feel that the police should be out there catching burglars. \\"We shouldn't be wasting police time, and I suspect many police officers... would rather be out doing the job that they joined the police service to do, rather than checking Facebook pages and Twitter accounts. \\"I think there are elements in the government who see an attack on trade unions as unfinished business, but I don't think the country is with them and I think there are growing concerns about the civil liberties implications of trying to undermine fundamental rights, human rights, like the right to strike.\\" Minister for Trade Unions, Nick Boles, said while the ability to strike is important, there should be a balance between the interests of union members and those who depend on their services. \\"People have the right to know that the services on which they and their families rely will not be disrupted at short notice by strikes supported by a small proportion of union members,\\" he added.

It is essential to consider various factors, such as the language used and the emotions conveyed, to accurately predict the sentiment contained in this tweet. Firstly, the tweet begins with an acknowledgement (@GirlNumberThree) and the word \\"Nice.\\" At a glance, this might seem positive; however, it is vital to examine the rest of the tweet, which paints a different picture. The user expresses their struggle with the current heat. The mention of \\"94 in my house\\" and \\"feels like 100 in my room\\" highlights the user's discomfort with the hot temperature. The high temperature mentioned indicates that the user is experiencing an unfavorable environment, leading to the assumption that the sentiment is negative. Moreover, the user states that they will be \\"up all night with this heat.\\" This communicates the user's restlessness and inability to find comfort or sleep due to the high temperature.

Upon arriving in P.E.I, Anne is met at the train station by an elderly Matthew Cuthbert who is surprised to find a girl there instead of a boy. Matthew and his sister Marilla had requested a boy to help them with the farm chores. He decides that he couldn't very well just leave the girl at the train station. Matthew takes Anne to meet Marilla, and on the buggy ride home, becomes completely smitten with the red-haired orphan girl. When Anne Shirley arrives at the Cuthberts' farm, called \\"Green Gables\\", she is a precocious, romantic child desperate to be loved and highly sensitive about her red hair and homely looks. In her own unique headstrong manner, Anne manages to insult the town gossip, Rachel Lynde, in a dispute over her looks; smash her slate over Gilbert Blythe's head when he calls her \\"Carrots\\" on her first day of school; and accidentally dyes her hair green in an effort to turn her red hair black and salvage her wounded pride.

Step 2: Evaluate the provided options We need to determine which of the given options best fits the context provided by the statement. The options are show, theatre, arena, presentation, and concert hall. Option 1: Show - A show typically includes various forms of entertainment but may not necessarily focus on providing new information or knowledge. Option 2: Theatre - Theatres host various forms of performing arts (e.g. plays, musicals) that tend to primarily entertain but might not primarily aim to teach something new. Option 3: Arena - An arena is a large, enclosed space where public sports or entertainment events occur. This option doesn't relate directly to the type of event. Option 4: Presentation - A presentation is generally an organized delivery of information, often accompanied by visual aids, designed to teach or inform the audience about a particular topic. Option 5: Concert hall - A concert hall typically hosts musical performances, which tend to entertain audiences but do not generally provide them with new information or knowledge.

A commander is typically associated with strong leadership, assertiveness, and decision-making skills. Next, I analyzed the second sentence, \\"She was very shy and quiet.\\" I considered how this description relates to the commonly held notions of a commander.

The first sentence: \\"In 2004, SCA acquired International Paper 's Tissue and Hygiene products businesses from Carter Holt Harvey.\\" In this sentence, the focus is placed primarily on the fact that SCA acquired the \\"Tissue and Hygiene products businesses.\\" The ownership of these businesses by International Paper is also emphasized, as well as the fact that they were purchased from Carter Holt Harvey. The second sentence: \\"In 2004 SCA acquired the tissue and hygiene products businesses of International Paper from Carter Holt Harvey.\\" In this version of the sentence, the acquisition of the businesses is still focused on, but the phrasing suggests a slight shift in emphasis.

Overall, both sentences convey the same general meaning: SCA acquired the tissue and hygiene product businesses of International Paper from Carter Holt Harvey in 2004.

It increases cellular respiration.. 4. It reduces water intake by roots..","completion":"To choose the correct answer, let's analyze each option: 1. It increases photosynthesis: Closing stomata reduces the intake of carbon dioxide, which is essential for photosynthesis. So, this option doesn't seem to help the plant during wilting. 2. It reduces further water loss: Closing the stomata will prevent water from escaping through the process of transpiration. This seems like a helpful response during wilting, as it helps conserve water. 3. It increases cellular respiration: While cellular respiration is essential for the plant's energy production, it's not related to the stomata's function during wilting. 4. It reduces water intake by roots: The stomata are found on the plant's leaves, not its roots. Their closure doesn't directly affect the root's water intake. Taking these analyses into account, I conclude that the correct answer is: 2. It reduces further water loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sentence: \\"I noticed him kissing Mary.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would indeed rate the sentence \\"I noticed him kissing Mary\\" to be acceptable linguistically. This assessment is based on factors such as word order, syntax, grammaticality, and communicative effectiveness that linguists analyze when evaluating sentences. 1. Word Order: In English, the standard word order is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This sentence follows this norm; the subject ('I') appears before the verb ('noticed'), which in turn precedes the object ('him kissing Mary'). 2. Syntax: The syntax of the sentence is also compliant with English rules. It features a main clause with a subject ('I') and a transitive verb ('noticed'). The verb 'noticed' requires an object, which in this case is a non-finite clause ('him kissing Mary'). This structure is perfectly acceptable within the English language. 3. Grammaticality: The sentence is grammatically correct in terms of tense agreement, pronoun usage, and verb transitivity. The past tense of the verb 'to notice' ('noticed') corresponds to an action that was observed in the past. The pronoun 'him' is used appropriately, as the indirect object 'kissing Mary' refers to the person originally mentioned. Finally, the verb 'kissing' is a gerund, making it suitable to function as an object in the sentence. 4. Communicative Effectiveness: In terms of conveying meaning, the sentence is coherent and unambiguous. It presents a clear picture of the situation: the speaker observed a male individual kissing Mary. In context, this would be easily understood by most, if not all, English speakers. In conclusion, a linguist would consider the sentence \\"I noticed him kissing Mary\\" to be acceptable linguistically, as it is compliant with English word order, syntax, and grammatical rules, and effectively communicates the intended meaning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Spanish conquest of the Iberian part of Navarre was commenced by Ferdinand II of Aragon and completed by Charles V in a series of military campaigns extending from 1512 to 1524, while the war lasted until 1528 in the Navarre to the north of the Pyrenees. Ferdinand the Catholic was in 1512 both king of Aragon and regent of Castile. When Pope Julius II declared a Holy League against France in late 1511, Navarre tried to remain neutral. Ferdinand used this as an excuse to attack Navarre, conquering it while its potential protector France was beset by England, Venice, and Ferdinand's Italian armies. Several attempts were made to reconquer Iberian Navarre starting right after the Castilian invasion , notably a halfhearted reconquest attempt in 1516 and a fully-fledged French-Navarrese reconquest campaign in 1521. All were defeated by the Spanish, and clashes came to halt to the north of the Pyrenees in 1528, when the Spanish troops withdrew from Lower Navarre. The Treaty of Cambrai between Spain and France in 1529 sealed the division of Navarre along the Pyrenees, while the independent Kingdom of Navarre survived in Lower Navarre ruled by the lineage of the Albrets united to their principality of Béarn, showing close links with France.

Alice Hamilton (February 27, 1869 - September 22, 1970) was an American physician, research scientist, and author who is best known as a leading expert in the field of occupational health and a pioneer in the field of industrial toxicology. She was also the first woman appointed to the faculty of Harvard University. Her scientific research focused on the study of occupational illnesses and the dangerous effects of industrial metals and chemical compounds. In addition to her scientific work, Hamilton was a social-welfare reformer, humanitarian, peace activist, and a resident-volunteer at Hull House in Chicago. In January 1919 Hamilton accepted a position as assistant professor in a newly-formed Department of Industrial Medicine (and after 1925 the School of Public Health) at Harvard Medical School, making her the first woman appointed to the Harvard University faculty in any field. Her appointment was hailed by the New York Tribune with the headline: \\"A Woman on Harvard Faculty--The Last Citadel Has Fallen--The Sex Has Come Into Its Own\\". Her own comment was \\"Yes, I am the first woman on the Harvard faculty--but not the first one who should have been appointed!\\" During her years at Harvard, from 1919 to her retirement in 1935, Hamilton never received a faculty promotion and held only a series of three-year appointments. At her request, the half-time appointments for which she taught one semester per year allowed her to continue her research and spend several months of each year at Hull House. Hamilton also faced discrimination as a woman. She was excluded from social activities, could not enter the Harvard Union, attend the Faculty Club, or receive a quota of football tickets. In addition, Hamilton was not allowed to march in the university's commencement ceremonies as the male faculty members did. Hamilton became a successful fundraiser for Harvard as she continued to write and conduct research on the dangerous trades. In addition to publishing \\"landmark reports for the U.S. Department of Labor\\" on research related to workers in Arizona copper mines and stonecutters at Indiana's limestone quarries, Hamilton also wrote Industrial Poisons in the United States (1925), the first American textbook on the subject, and another related textbook, Industrial Toxicology (1934). At tetraethyl lead conference in Washington, D.C. in 1925, Hamilton was the most prominent critic of adding tetraethyl lead to gasoline. Hamilton also remained an activist in social reform efforts. Her specific interests in civil liberties, peace, birth control, and protective labor legislation for women caused some of her critics to consider her a \\"radical\\" and a \\"subversive.\\" From 1924 to 1930, she served as the only woman member of the League of Nations Health Committee. She also visited the Soviet Union in 1924 and Nazi Germany in April 1933. Hamilton wrote \\"The Youth Who Are Hitler's Strength,\\" which was published in The New York Times. The article described Nazi exploitation of youth in the years between the two world wars. She also criticized the Nazi education, especially its domestic training for girls.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Yes, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In the premise, it is mentioned that San'doro looked at Jon from under his hood, with a line of blood drawn across one eye. This statement implies that San'doro is indeed bleeding, as the presence of blood indicates some form of injury or wound. The narrative provided in the premise describes a specific situation where San'doro is looking at Jon while wearing a hood, and the line of blood across his eye suggests that he might have been involved in some action or circumstances resulting in the injury. The details provided about the line of blood and the injury to the eye affirm the hypothesis that San'doro is bleeding. Furthermore, the fact that the blood is described as being drawn \\"across one eye\\" gives us more information about the location and severity of the injury. From this description, it can be concluded that the bleeding is likely not a minor scratch or abrasion, but rather a more significant wound that has caused blood to flow down across the eye. This further supports the hypothesis that San'doro is indeed bleeding. In summary, the hypothesis that San'doro is bleeding is indeed entailed by the premise provided. The information within the premise clearly establishes that San'doro has suffered an injury that has resulted in blood flowing across his eye, thus confirming the hypothesis that he is bleeding."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the family whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine? , can you please find it? The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple.

Movie title: Dead Poets Society Context: New England, the late 1950s. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), a lonely and painfully shy teenager, who is under pressure by his stern parents because he must live up to his older brother's reputation to attend Yale and become a lawyer, arrives for the new semester at the Welton Academy for boys -- Todd's brother also attended Welton and was a popular and well-regarded student there. This semester begins during an orientation gathering with a speech given by the stern Headmaster Nolan (Norman Lloyd), who states the academy's four pillars: Tradition, Honor, Discipline, and Excellence. Todd meets Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) an ambitious student whom becomes his dorm roommate.Later in his dorm, Neil is ordered by his grumpy and domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) to drop his involvement with the school annual in order to maintain good grades so the boy may become a doctor much as he has done. Neil is under pressure from his stern father's will. Also, Mr. Perry tells Neil that Mrs. Perry also wants him to become a doctor, which further worries the boy. A little later, Todd tells Neil that he is in a similar situation with his parents involving his older brother who also attended Welton a few years ago, graduated, and attended Yale Law School and became a lawyer and his parents want the exact same thing for him. But Todd does not have the courage to tell his parents that he instead wants to be a writer, not a lawyer.During the first day of classes Todd and Neil experience the various teaching methods which include speeches by the trig teacher, as well as the Latin teacher, and the math teacher who states that \\"all 20 questions at the end of the first chapter are due tomorrow\\".

The city of Weifang in Shandong is the home of the kite. The city holds an international kite festival in April every year. There are competitions for kite-flying skills and new styles of kites. The most famous is the competition for the \\"Kite King \\". Thousands of kite fans from more than 30 countries visit the city to take part in the competitions, or to just enjoy this colorful event .

What is the scenario that could best explain how the people got sick? Choices: A). contact with environmental sources; B). contact with an infected animal; C). contact with a contaminated object; D). contact with an infected person;","completion":"D). Contact with an infected person Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness that is caused by the influenza virus. It is primarily spread through the respiratory droplets from the coughs and sneezes of infected individuals. Considering the scenario of ten people becoming sick with the flu after attending a school dance, the most plausible explanation is that they had contact with an infected person (option D). During a school dance, attendees are usually in close proximity to one another, engaging in conversations and social interactions, which makes it easier for pathogens to spread. In this case, it is highly likely that one or more individuals were already infected with the influenza virus, but were either not showing symptoms yet or were experiencing mild symptoms that did not deter them from going to the event. Asymptomatic individuals can still spread the virus to others unknowingly. As these infected individuals mingled, coughed, or sneezed during the dance, they would have released respiratory droplets containing the virus particles into the air. These droplets can then be inhaled by people nearby, causing them to become infected as well. The confined space, increased social interaction, and high level of people sharing the space could facilitate a faster spread of the virus. To further review the other choices: A). Contact with environmental sources: Although it is possible for the flu to spread through environmental sources, such as air conditioning systems, it is less likely in this scenario because person-to-person contact is the primary mode of transmission. Additionally, the fact that only ten individuals fell ill, rather than a larger number of attendees, suggests that the cases are more likely due to close contact with an infected person rather than an environmental source. B). Contact with an infected animal: Influenza can be transmitted between animals and humans; however, it is highly improbable that an infected animal was present at a school dance, making this option implausible in this context. C). Contact with a contaminated object: While it is true that the influenza virus can survive on various surfaces for a limited amount of time and can potentially cause infection if a person touches the contaminated object and then touches their face, it is less likely compared to direct contact with an infected person. The fact that all ten individuals fell ill after attending the same event further strengthens the argument that they were infected by an ill person during the event rather than independent contact with contaminated objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

DNA is something that everybody has, and it tells the body what to do. DNA is the reason that we look like our mother and father, because we get some of their DNA to make our own. People have been trying to understand the human body for a long time. In 1860, Gregor Mendel discovered a special reason why we look the same as other people in our family. It is because of small things named \\"genes\\" in our body. In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick made another discovery and found out that those small parts are real messages written in the DNA with a special language. In 1961, Marshall Nirenberg and Johann Matthaci found a message in DNA showing how DNA tells the cell to build its parts. Scientists have now found all the words in the DNA map, but we still do not understand what they all do. By understanding what just one \\"word\\" means, we can help save more people from several illnesses. Most people hope that this will help make better medicine and help sick people. Other people worry that when people begin to know more words and find out lots of other information, we might use it in a wrong way, just to make people more attractive, or stop sick people from getting jobs.

Young William Wallace (James Robinson) witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father (Sean Lawlor) and brother (Sandy Nelson), and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle (Brian Cox), where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including Prima Nocte. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace (Mel Gibson) returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to slaughter the English garrison in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England. Longshanks orders his son Prince Edward (Peter Hanly) to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at Stirling and then destroys the city of York, killing Longshanks' nephew (Richard Leaf) and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), the son of nobleman Robert the Elder (Ian Bannen) and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife Isabella of France (Sophie Marceau) to try to negotiate with Wallace. After meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army...

Is the premise \\"The women are wearing red shirts, and singing.\\" true if \\"The singers are men wearing black shirts\\"?","completion":"In evaluating the premise \\"The women are wearing red shirts, and singing.\\" when given the information \\"The singers are men wearing black shirts,\\" it is essential to examine and compare the statements carefully. The first premise describes a scenario where women, wearing red shirts, are engaged in an activity – singing. The second statement, however, indicates that the singers are, in fact, men who wear black shirts. Based on the information provided, these two statements hold contrasting ideas. In the first statement, we are given that the singers in question are women with red shirts. Nonetheless, the second statement contradicts this claim, specifying that the singers are not women but men wearing black shirts. To determine whether or not the initial premise is true, we must examine any possible scenarios where both statements might be concurrently valid. For instance, it could be the case that there are two separate groups of singers – one group of women wearing red shirts and another group of men wearing black shirts. In this situation, although the singers described in the two statements are different, both premises may hold true. However, without adequate context, it is impossible to assess if such a scenario exists. Based on the information provided, we only know that “the singers are men wearing black shirts.” In conclusion, considering the details given, the premise \\"The women are wearing red shirts and singing\\" cannot be confirmed as true. The only information available explicitly states that the singers are men wearing black shirts, which directly contradicts the first premise. Without further context, it is difficult to determine if both premises can coexist truthfully. Therefore, based on the information provided, the premise \\"The women are wearing red shirts, and singing\\" cannot be deemed true."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a question about part-of-speech tag of a word in the question.

Keypoint: The death penalty irreversible 1. Understand the debate topic: Abolishing capital punishment or the death penalty is being debated. 2. Understand the argument: The argument states that one of the main reasons to oppose capital punishment is the risk of executing innocent people because of potential mistakes, incorrect witness accounts, and flawed legal defenses. 3. Understand the keypoint: The keypoint focuses on the irreversible nature of the death penalty. Now, let's analyze if the keypoint matches and summarizes the argument: The keypoint \\"The death penalty is irreversible\\" is connected to the argument as it highlights a consequence of executing potentially innocent people. However, it does not fully summarize the argument since it doesn't explicitly mention the reasons for possible mistakes (witnesses being wrong or lawyers making errors in defense).

The Stooges are artists (Moe is a sculptor, Larry is a music composer, and Curly is a painter) living in Paris. When the landlord comes after the overdue rent, the boys skip out and wind up accidentally joining the French Foreign Legion that they confuse with the American Legion. Posted to the desert, their assignment is to guard Captain Gorgonzola from the natives. When the captain is kidnapped, the boys are given a chance to bring him back alive. The Stooges make their way to the town where the captain was taken, all disguised as Santa Claus (complete with a sleigh and a reindeer). Despite the disguise not working, they are able to quickly knock out a guard who confronted them and make their way further into town. Ultimately, they find their captain held by a sheik trying to offer him expensive jewelry and a harem of beautiful women in exchange for the Legion's ammunition. The trio are forced to disguise themselves again as part of the harem and use an opportunity during a dance to render the sheik and his head bodyguard unconscious. The four then escape, but end up coming across a lion's den. Before the lion could eat them, Curly is able to placate it into drawing them on a wagon back to their camp.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Ballantine Books is a major book publisher located in the United States, founded in 1952 by Ian Ballantine with his wife, Betty Ballantine. It was acquired by Random House in 1973, which in turn was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998 and remains part of that company today. Ballantine's logo is a pair of mirrored letter Bs back to back. The firm's early editors were Stanley Kauffman and Bernard Shir-Cliff. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company). - The term \\"manga\\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana: or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \\"Manga\\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan. - Del Rey Manga was the manga-publishing imprint of Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books, which in turn is part of Random House, the publishing division of Bertelsmann. It was formed as part of a cross-publishing relationship with Japanese publisher Kodansha. Some of the Del Rey titles, such as \\"Tsubasa Chronicle\\" and \\"xxxHolic\\", are published in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi. Tricia Narwani, the editor of Del Rey, stated that \\"Del Rey finds most of its talent through conventions and existing professional contacts\\". - Lester del Rey (June 2, 1915 May 10, 1993) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the author of many books in the juvenile Winston Science Fiction series, and the editor at Del Rey Books, the fantasy and science fiction imprint of Ballantine Books, along with his fourth wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. - The Silver Wolf is a novel by Alice Borchardt and published by Del Rey Books in 1993 . It is the first in the Silver Wolf Trilogy . - Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels, \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\", revolving around the central character of Lestat. Books from \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" were the subject of two film adaptations, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in 1994, and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" in 2002. - Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC is an American film and television production company based in the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. The studio is best known for creating and producing the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound and computer animation for film. Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California; most of the company's operations were moved to San Francisco in 2005. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of 4.06 billion. - The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the world's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Random House is the largest general-interest paperback publisher in the world. As of 2013, it is part of Penguin Random House, which is jointly owned by German media conglomerate Bertelsmann and British global education and publishing company Pearson PLC. - Alice Borchardt (née Alice Allen O'Brien; October 6, 1939 July 24, 2007) was a writer of historical fiction, fantasy, horror.

It is revealed that that meteorite is actually Black Adam, returning to Earth after a long exile. The film then cuts to young Billy Batson living in a rundown slum, with very little food and rats for pets. He gets out of bed wearing a t-shirt with the Superman crest. He goes to the kitchen to find food, but discovers he only has potato chips, which he ends up feeding to the rats. On his way to meet with Clark Kent in a nearby diner, he sees some bullies mugging a homeless man. After attempting to defend the man, Billy himself receives a black eye. The homeless man thanks Billy for his intervention, calling him \\"The Captain\\". Billy tells him that he always tries to do the right thing. Billy gives him the only thing of value he has â a subway token. At the diner, Clark buys the boy three breakfasts, and tells him he wants to write a story to bring his plight, and those in his same situation, to public light.

Answer: Defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias , ventricular fibrillation , and pulseless ventricular tachycardia . Question: when can you use a defibulator The answer is:","completion":"Yes, defibrillation is a common treatment for life-threatening cardiac dysrhythmias, ventricular fibrillation, and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. You can use a defibrillator when someone is experiencing any of these life-threatening heart conditions. A defibrillator works by delivering an electric shock to the heart in an attempt to restore its normal rhythm. It is essential to use a defibrillator as soon as possible in these situations, as the chances of survival decrease with each passing minute. Ideally, defibrillation should be performed within three to five minutes of the onset of the cardiac event. Defibrillators can be found in a variety of settings, such as in emergency medical facilities, public places (like airports, malls, and stadiums), and in some cases, even in private homes. Automatic External Defibrillators (AEDs) are designed to be user-friendly and can be used by people with minimal training in CPR and AED use. Before using a defibrillator, make sure to call for emergency medical assistance (like 911 or your local emergency number), and start CPR. When a defibrillator is available, follow the device's voice prompts and visual instructions to ensure proper use.

Article: My name is Lin Hui. I like to tell stories about people who work together. What is even better is when countries help each other and build a good friendship. An excellent example of this happened when Britain and China worked together to bring the Milu deer back to China. Milu deer, a kind of animal with large horns , used to be common in China long ago. Like other deer they lived together and ate grass and the soft parts of trees. Milu deer were often killed for food or sport. The Ming and Qing dynasties did not protect them and many were killed. That is how the Milu deer disappeared from China. Luckily before all of them were killed, some were taken to Britain to improve the environment of the beautiful park which belonged to the Duke of Bedford. He liked them so much that he took them from China to Britain. Milu deer liked the cool, wet weather in England and their number increased year by year. As a result, when in 1985 the government of China wanted to bring back the Milu deer, the Duke of Bedford was able to help. The first deer came back to China to the Nanhaizi Milu Park 20 kilometers south of Beijing and the centre in Dafeng, Jiangsu province. The deer certainly seem happy to be back in China because their number has grown quickly. There are now so many of them that a new park has been opened for them in Hubei Province. At the moment the Milu deer live in centres where they are being well protected and cared for. It is hoped that one day there will be enough animals to let them live in the wild again. 294words Question: After some of the Milu deer were taken to Britain,_.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"Painting keys can be both a fun and functional project. The process can brighten up an old or plain key, as well as help differentiate keys from one another. In order to accomplish this task effectively, the following steps should be taken. 1. Gather Your Supplies: To start off, you will need several supplies. This includes the keys you wish to paint, acrylic paints, or nail polish in the colors of your choosing, clear acrylic sealer or clear nail top coat for a finish, a paintbrush if you're using acrylic paints, a piece of old cloth or paper towel for cleaning, and a disposable plate or palette for paint. 2. Prepare Your Workspace: Lay out some newspaper or an old tablecloth to protect your workspace. This will help safeguard your surface from any paint spills. 3. Clean The Keys: Before painting, it's crucial to clean the key properly to make sure the paint will stick. This can be done with mild soap and warm water or with rubbing alcohol. Make sure to dry the keys thoroughly before you paint them. 4. Apply the Paint: Start painting your keys with the colors of your choice. If you're using acrylic paint, you might need several layers to achieve a solid color. Once you finish one side and its edges, allow the key to dry completely before flipping to the other side to avoid smudging the paint. 5. Add Patterns or Designs: If you'd like, you can use a finer paintbrush to add small patterns or designs on your keys. From stripes, dots, small shapes to initials - make it creative and personal. 6. Sealing the Paint: Once the keys are fully dry and you're happy with the look, you have to seal the paint to make sure it lasts. You can use clear nail polish or clear acrylic sealer for this. Apply a generous layer on both sides of the key, ensuring all painted areas are covered. Allow it to dry completely. 7. Let it Dry: The last and most critical step is to let the keys dry thoroughly. This can take several hours or up to 24 hours depending on the amount of paint and sealer used. Ensure they are completely dry before using them to prevent the paint from peeling off. 8. Maintenance: Remember to take care of your painted keys. Excessive wear or dropping the keys can cause the paint to chip. If this happens, you can always touch up the key with more paint and sealer. Each step is designed to ensure that the paint adheres well to the keys and is sealed effectively to prevent it from fading or chipping too easily. Painting your keys can add a personal touch and help distinguish one key from another. Remember to have fun and get creative when painting your keys."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Is President Obama's Carter moment nearing? \\"This is the worst,\\" a Democratic friend exclaimed over the phone on Tuesday, the first day back at work after the Memorial Day weekend. I knew without asking what he meant -- the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico that dominated television coverage and was into its second month with no quick solution in sight. No, I told him. It's not yet the worst. They haven't built a popular new television program around it -- yet. No one has created a new media franchise for himself out of it. There isn't a name for it that has become part of popular culture. I was thinking back to when another Democratic president, Jimmy Carter, found himself stymied in another seemingly endless ordeal. Iranian militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 officials and workers hostage for 444 days, while the United States was helpless to free them. Many of us recall the event by the name that became attached to it: \\"America Held Hostage.\\" That was the title ABC News slapped on its half-hour news update that aired each night, with Ted Koppel as anchor. The show later became the long-running program \\"Nightline.\\" This is when you know you are truly harpooned, when your problem has become someone else's meal ticket. As sinister as the jet stream of escaping oil and gas looks via the underwater camera in the gulf, Barack Obama has not yet moved into the category of the late-night patsy that Jimmy Carter became. The Iranians were more clever, or diabolical, in exploiting their hostages than the restrained BP executives or their enviro foes are in this situation. Obama keeps popping up in new settings, sounding as if he is in command, and he has refused to be confined to the White House as Carter was by the hostage crisis. His good-guy Coast Guard retired admiral has not melted under the pressure, and the BP execs we've seen on TV refuse to play cartoon capitalists, instead conveying the sense that they grieve over the accident. As a result, this saga, painful as it is, has not yet become the simple demonstration of monumental futility and incompetence that the hostage crisis became for Carter, who let his personal frustration become the nation's humiliation. When he finally mounted a rescue effort, and the helicopters crashed into each other in the desert before reaching the hostages, it was the final proof that he was cursed in anything he tried to do. That truly was the worst. Today we're not there -- yet. But we have seen this movie before, and we know how it ends politically. Somebody else shows up and says he can fix this. Or end it. Or make it come out right. This is why Democrats are right to be very nervous as this gulf incident drags on in its second month. We have endured about as much technical explanation of the rigors of deep-sea drilling as we can stand. The chart talks demonstrating that we had figured out where the hostages were being held didn't do Carter a lick of good when voters were aching to see the captives walk into their families' arms. Nothing is going to help Obama unless and until the engineers come up with a method for shutting down this gusher of pollution. He clearly couldn't prevent it, and he was slow in signaling its severity. But he owns it now, and until it is over, the man who aspired to be the next John Kennedy or maybe Franklin Roosevelt will have to hope he doesn't end up as Jimmy Carter. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"This text is about how President Obama's situation with the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico is being compared to President Carter's hostage crisis in Iran back in 1979. The most important parts of the text are: 1. President Obama is dealing with an oil leak crisis in the Gulf of Mexico that has been ongoing for two months. 2. The oil leak crisis has not yet reached the same level of negative impact on Obama's image as the hostage crisis did for President Carter. 3. Some people believe that President Obama's handling of the situation has been better than Carter's handling of the hostage crisis. 4.

Translate to Finnish","completion":"Maassamme lääkkeet ovat usein kalliimpia kuin vanhoissa Euroopan unionin jäsenmaissa. Tämä ero lääkkeiden hinnoissa johtuu monista eri tekijöistä, kuten maakohtaisista hinta- ja toimitussopimuksista, määräalennuksista, veroista sekä erilaisista terveydenhuollon järjestelmistä. Erot voivat olla merkittäviä ja johtaa siihen, että ihmiset joutuvat mahdollisesti maksamaan enemmän lääkkeistään meidän maassamme verrattuna vanhoihin Euroopan unionin jäsenvaltioihin. Yksi syy korkeampaan lääkkeiden hintaan voi olla lääkevalmistajien ja maahantuojien pienemmät määräalennukset. Toisin kuin suurissa Euroopan maissa, pienemmissä maissa ei välttämättä ole yhtä paljon ostovoimaa, jolloin lääkeyhtiöt eivät tarjoa samalta kokoisia alennuksia kappalemäärän kasvaessa. Tämä voi johtaa suurempiin kustannuksiin lääkkeiden hankinnassa ja siten korkeampiin hintoihin kuluttajille. Lisäksi erilaiset verot ja maksut voivat lisätä lääkkeiden hintoja. Esimerkiksi arvonlisävero (ALV) voi vaihdella EU-maiden välillä, ja se voi vaikuttaa lääkkeiden lopulliseen hintaan. Joissakin maissa, kuten meidän maassamme, saattaa olla myös korkeampia erityisveroja lääkkeille tai maksuja lääkkeiden jaoksen seurantaan ja valvontaan. Terveydenhuollon järjestelmät vaikuttavat myös lääkkeiden hintaan. Maissamme saattaa olla muita malleja, kuten julkinen terveydenhuolto tai yksityisiin sairausvakuutuksiin perustuva järjestelmä. Erot näiden järjestelmien välillä johtavat usein siihen, että kuluttajat joutuvat maksamaan enemmän lääkkeistä, sillä meidän maassa voidaan mahdollisesti joutua kattamaan suurempi osa lääkekustannuksista itse. Saattaa olla, että joissakin Euroopan unionin jäsenmaissa maksut ovat alhaisemmat siksi, että yhteiskunta suuremmassa määrin kattaa lääkekulut. On tärkeää huomata, että tämä ongelma on monimutkainen ja vaikuttaa moniin eri osa-alueisiin, minkä vuoksi ratkaiseminen ei ole yksinkertaista.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million.

John Smith, though he had not been in Virginia since 1609 and was not a first hand eyewitness, related in his History of Virginia that braves of the Powhatan \\"came unarmed into our houses with deer, turkeys, fish, fruits, and other provisions to sell us\\". The Powhatan grabbed any tools or weapons available and killed all English settlers they found, including men, women, and children of all ages. Chief Opechancanough led a coordinated series of surprise attacks by the Powhatan Confederacy that killed 347 people, a quarter of the English population of the Virginia colony. Jamestown, founded in 1607, was the site of the first successful English settlement in North America, and was then the capital of the Colony of Virginia. Its tobacco economy led to constant expansion and seizure of Powhatan lands, which ultimately provoked a violent reaction. Question: What country did the Indian Massacre of 1622 take place in?

Please answer the following question: This article: Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \\"He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\\", in the words of critic Mark Feeney. Television director Steve Binder, no fan of Presley's music before he oversaw the '68 Comeback Special, reported, \\"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\\" His performance style, as much as his physical beauty, was responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Writing in 1970, critic George Melly described him as \\"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\\". In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him as \\"the man who brought overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\\". Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some cultural critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \\"aggressively bisexual in appeal\\". Brett Farmer places the \\"orgasmic gyrations\\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \\"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\\". In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \\"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\\"Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with various Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s.

If \\"A group of kids look out of a fence.\\", can we conclude \\"Humans are looking.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"humans are looking\\" based on the provided statement, \\"A group of kids look out of a fence.\\" Let's break down this conclusion by considering the context and definitions of the words used in both statements. First, let us analyze the given statement: \\"A group of kids look out of a fence.\\" In this statement, we have three primary pieces of information: \\"group of kids,\\" \\"look,\\" and \\"out of a fence.\\" 1. \\"Group of kids\\": Kids are young human beings, usually below the age of 18. The statement mentions a group, meaning that there is more than one child involved. 2. \\"Look\\": To look is to direct one's eyes towards something or someone to see or influence what is there. In this context, the kids are presumably directing their attention and gaze towards something or someone. 3. \\"Out of a fence\\": This part of the statement indicates that there is a fence present as an obstacle or boundary, and the kids are looking beyond it. Now, let's examine the conclusion statement: \\"Humans are looking.\\" In this statement, we have two main components: \\"humans\\" and \\"looking.\\" 1. \\"Humans\\": Humans are the species Homo sapiens, which includes people of all ages, including adults and children. In the given statement, \\"a group of kids\\" would fall under the category of humans, as kids are young humans. 2. \\"Looking\\": As mentioned previously, looking involves directing one's eyes towards something or someone to see what is there. In the given statement, the action of looking is performed by the group of kids. By analyzing the information provided in both statements, we can connect the relevant components to draw the conclusion. Since the group of kids are young humans, their action of looking out of a fence can indeed be generalized to the conclusion that \\"humans are looking.\\" While the given statement specifically refers to a group of kids, the conclusion focuses on the broader category of humans (i.e., children and adults). Nonetheless, the conclusion is valid because the action of looking performed by the kids can be attributed to the wider human species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What is the answer: Muslims believe the verses of the Qu'ran were given by God to Muhammad through whom?","completion":"Muslims believe that the verses of the Qu'ran were given by God (Allah) to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Jibril, also known as Gabriel in English. The Qu'ran, which is considered to be the holy scripture of Islam, is believed to be the literal word of God as it was revealed to Muhammad by Jibril. This divine communication took place over a period of 23 years, beginning in 610 CE when Muhammad was 40 years old, until his death in 632 CE. The revelations were sent to guide and instruct Muhammad, who was then responsible for conveying the message to his followers and the entire world. The process of revelation commenced when Muhammad, who had a habit of retreating to a cave on Mount Hira for deep contemplation and meditation, was visited by the angel Jibril. According to Islamic tradition, during Muhammad's first encounter with Jibril, he was instructed to \\"Read!\\" or \\"Recite!\\" (the word \\"Iqra\\" in Arabic). This marks the beginning of the prophethood of Muhammad and the inception of the Qu'ran. The revelations that Muhammad received from Jibril were usually in the form of direct speech or inspired visions. Muhammad would memorize these revelations and, thereafter, recite them to his companions, who would also commit them to memory, as well as write them down on various materials such as parchment, bones, and leaves. Over time, the revelations were compiled into a single volume — the Qu'ran. As the intermediary between Allah and Muhammad, Jibril plays a critical role in the Islamic faith. Not only was he responsible for delivering the verses of the Qu'ran, but Jibril also provided guidance, explanations, and interpretations of the revelations to help Muslims deepen their understanding of the holy scripture. In Islamic tradition, Jibril is considered to be one of the four archangels and is highly revered as the \\"Angel of Revelation.\\" In summary, Muslims believe that the verses of the Qu'ran were given by Allah to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Jibril. This process of divine revelation took place over 23 years, during which the messages were eventually compiled into the Qu'ran, the holy scripture of Islam."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is often used to improve clarity, simplify complex information, or avoid repetition. In both of the given sentences, the information conveyed is the same. The second sentence is a slightly shorter version of the first one, but they still communicate the same key points. In the first sentence: 1. The sentence begins with the person's birth information - \\"He was born in Frederick Dallas Cairns in London, England, UK.\\" 2.

Please answer the following question: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules.

Stockton's \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\", and Jules Feiffer's \\"Passionella.\\" These stories shaped each act, giving birth to a unique and fascinating musical experience. The production featured a talented cast, including Alan Alda, Barbara Harris, and Larry Blyden. Thanks to Bock's creative genius, The Apple Tree's music is both engaging and original. He skillfully weaves together diverse musical styles and influences, providing a distinctive voice to each act and story in the production. From the whimsical and introspective elements in \\"The Diary of Adam and Eve\\" to the lush and romantic tones in \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" and the comedic, satirical twists in \\"Passionella,\\" Bock's captivating compositions played a vital role in bringing these stories to life. Ranked among Bock's many memorable compositions are his other iconic works, such as \\"Fiddler on the Roof,\\" \\"She Loves Me,\\" \\"Fiorello!\\" and \\"The Rothschilds,\\" which further attest to his versatile talent and ability to create captivating music for the theater. In conclusion, the American musical theater composer whose music is featured in The Apple Tree is the legendary Jerry Bock. His compositions showcase his unique ability to tell meaningful and engaging stories through music, and his partnership with lyricist Sheldon Harnick produced some of the most beloved musicals in the history of American theater. The Apple Tree serves as just one shining example of Bock's immense contribution to the world of musical theater."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: : A sensor for remote detection of formaldehyde (FA) fumes in the atmosphere has been developed, based on the redox reaction between FA and silver nitrate. The sensor is worn as a bracelet and the data acquired are transferred via a Blue-tooth channel to a smartphone. A dedicated software transforms the signal from a grey to a colour scale. The signal response has been assessed over low (20 to 120 ppb) as well as higher (1-15 ppm range) levels. The sensor has been applied to monitor potential FA fumes of some artwork in two locations: the Tate’s gallery in London, during the display of several pieces of Damien Hirst, as well as in the Summer Palace in Beijing. In the first case, one of Hirst’s main subjects is the setting-up of giant fish tanks filled by thousands of liters of FA, in which intact biological specimens are immersed, such as zebras, cows, calves, even sharks. The parallelepiped-shaped basins are then covered with a lid and fully sealed with silicon gums. It has been found that the tanks are surrounded by FA fumes, constantly exuded in the atmosphere (likely via the sealant), reaching levels of 5 ppm, one order of magnitude higher than the 0.5 ppm limit set up by legislation. In the Summer Palace too posters in display and wooden beam works have been found to release FA vapours. ||||| Damien Hirst knows there's nothing like a touch of mild peril to set the art world alight - and it seems that's exactly what the artist inadvertently produced at his 2012 Tate gallery retrospective. A research paper in a Royal Society of Chemistry journal detailed in the Daily Mail, reportedly found that Hirst's preserved artworks \\"Away From The Flock\\" and \\"Mother And Child Divided\\", leaked potentially dangerous levels of formaldehyde whilst displayed at Tate Modern gallery for five months in 2012. Atmospheric levels reportedly reached up to 5ppm (parts per million) - ten times over the advisory limit. Damien Hirst has, in the past, hinted at his impish lust for using the dangerous chemical in his work, claiming his penchant for formaldehyde is driven by the fact that \\"it is dangerous and it burns your skin. If you breathe it in, it chokes you.\\" A spokesman for the Tate gallery responded to the report: \\"Tate always puts the safety of its staff and visitors first, and we take all necessary precautions when installing and displaying our exhibitions. These works contained a very dilute formaldehyde solution that was contained within sealed tanks.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A sensor that detects formaldehyde (FA) fumes in the atmosphere has been developed and used to monitor artwork by Damien Hirst at the Tate’s gallery in London and the Summer Palace in Beijing.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Losing a baby tooth can be fun for a kid. You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay. Options: A should brush them with a special denture brush every few days B will take a very long time to adjust himself or herself to them C will experience unpleasant feelings at the beginning of fixing them D should use denture solution to soak them in his or her mouth Answer: C will experience unpleasant feelings at the beginning of fixing them Question:","completion":"What can a person experience when they first start using dentures?

Arab history in the United States goes back to the late 1800's when large numbers of Arab immigrants first began making their journey to a land known simply as\\"Amreeka\\". Historians generally describe Arab immigration to America in two waves.The first wave took place between 1860 and 1924.The first wave consisted of Lebanese and Syrian,and some Egyptian immigrants.These new immigrants,who were mostly Christian,came to America in search of better opportunities.Even the doomed Titanic,which set sail for America in 1912,had close to a hundred Arab passengers aboard.The majority of Arab-Americans today are descendents of the first wave of immigrants;they are the third or more generation Americans. The second wave of immigrants followed after World War II,caused by political unrest in the Middle East.This second wave of immigrants consists of mainly Arab Muslims and continues to this day. Arab-Americans make up 3 million of the population in the United States,according to demographers.And quite different from popular belief,64 percent of them are American-born.Eighty-two percent of Arab-Americans are US citizens. Arab-Americans are beyond the national average in both education and income.Education is important among Arab-Americans;82 percent have high school diplomas,36 percent have bachelor's degrees or higher,and 15 percent have graduate degrees.The-median average income among Arab-Americans is 39 580,which is higher than the US average.

Matthew was a great swimmer while Benjamin was not since Options: A). Matthew had owned a pool all of their life.. B). Benjamin had owned a pool all of their life..","completion":"I'll continue the story with Option A, since it makes more sense: Matthew was a great swimmer while Benjamin was not, since Matthew had owned a pool all of their life. Having grown up with unlimited access to a pristine swimming pool, Matthew had spent countless hours splashing, diving, and perfecting his strokes. Over the years, this constant practice helped him develop an innate talent for swimming. Step 1: Establish the bond between Matthew and Benjamin. Growing up in the same neighborhood, Matthew and Benjamin had been best friends since they were toddlers. They loved playing together and never let their differences come in the way of their friendship. Even though Matthew was a much stronger swimmer, it never led to any jealousy or resentment between the two. Benjamin was comfortable in his own skin and had his own unique interests and talents. Step 2: Elaborate on Benjamin's interests and talents. Benjamin's true passion was music. He had an enviable collection of musical instruments and spent hours each day mastering the subtleties of various rhythms, melodies, and techniques. Though he could keep up with Matthew in pursuits like soccer or basketball, he never quite managed to match his friend's grace and fluidity in the water. Despite that, Benjamin never shied away from joining Matthew for a refreshing swim on a hot summer day. Step 3: Introduce a challenge for the characters to face together. One day, the local community center announced an upcoming charity event where participants could showcase their skills in a fortnight-long competition. Both Matthew and Benjamin knew they had to take part in the event. They decided to turn their talent and passion into something meaningful by raising money for a cause they both believed in – providing opportunities for underprivileged children. Matthew signed up for the swimming competition, while Benjamin eagerly registered for the musical talent show. Step 4: Describe how they prepare for the competition. In preparation for the big day, Matthew and Benjamin made full use of their respective home amenities. Matthew spent long hours in his pool, continuously refining his technique and building his stamina. Benjamin, on the other hand, rehearsed his heart out with his instruments and practiced a wide variety of genres to wow the audience. Even though they were both engrossed in their own schedules, they made it a point to come together each evening to share their progress and support each other's efforts, always offering words of encouragement and motivation. Step 5: Write about the competition day and the outcome. Finally, the day of the competition dawned. Matthew and Benjamin's families and friends gathered at the community center, buzzing with excitement and pride for their performances. Confident in their abilities, the two friends knew they had given their all in preparation. Matthew swam with unparalleled grace and speed, winning first place in the swimming competition. Benjamin, in turn, delivered a mesmerizing performance that captivated the audience, securing him the top spot in the musical talent show. Step 6: Conclude the story with their accomplishments and bond. Together, Matthew and Benjamin had not only showcased their talents and passions, but also managed to raise a significant sum for the charity they chose. Their bond only grew stronger as they realized the importance of supporting each other's abilities and aspirations, and that their friendship was the true driving force behind their success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their attempts to carry the piano up the stairs result in it rolling and crashing into the street below several times, twice with Ollie in tow. During their first attempt, they encounter a lady with a baby carriage trying to go down the steps; in trying to let her pass, they knock the piano back down the stairs. After the lady laughs at them, Stan kicks her in her backside, causing her to punch him back and hit Ollie over the head with a milk bottle. Stan and Ollie then heft the piano back up the stairs. The angry lady tells a policeman on the corner, who kicks Ollie twice and hits Stan with his truncheon after the latter suggests the officer is \\"bounding over his steps\\" (i.e. \\"overstepping his bounds\\"). Meanwhile, the piano has rolled down the steps again. The two doggedly persist in carrying the piano up the stairs for a third time. Halfway up, they encounter the short-tempered and pompous Professor Theodore von Schwartzenhoffen, M.D., A.D., D.D.S., F.L.D., F-F-F-and-F. He impatiently tells them to take the piano out of his way; he should like to pass. Ollie very reasonably and sensibly suggests he walk around, which sets off the Professor in a fit of Teutonic rage. He screams at Stan and Ollie to get the piano out of his way, and Stan knocks the Professor's top hat down the stairs and into the street, where it is crushed by a passing vehicle. The outraged professor leaves, loudly threatening to have the two arrested.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: Hindi is the national language of which country? Question 2: Should Hindi be made the national language of India? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Hindi is the national language of which country? Answer: Hindi is the national language of India. It is one of the 22 scheduled languages of the Indian constitution. India is a linguistically diverse country with more than 1,600 languages spoken across different regions. However, Hindi, written in the Devanagari script, serves as the lingua franca in several parts of the country. It is spoken by around 44% of the Indian population, making it the most widely spoken language in India. Additionally, Hindi is one of the two official languages of the Indian central government, the other being English. Question 2: Should Hindi be made the national language of India? Answer: The question of whether Hindi should be made the national language of India is subjective and depends on an individual's perspective. To provide a well-rounded answer, let's consider some arguments from both sides. Advantages of making Hindi the national language: 1. Enhanced communication: Having a single national language can improve communication and foster unity among people from different regions, creating a better sense of national identity. 2. Administrative efficiency: A single national language can simplify administrative tasks and make government functions more efficient, as it would reduce the need for translation and interpreters. 3. Ease of learning: Many Indian languages trace their roots to Sanskrit, which is closely related to Hindi. Hence, speakers of other Indian languages could potentially find it easier to learn Hindi compared to, say, English or other languages. Disadvantages of making Hindi the national language: 1. Linguistic diversity: India boasts a rich linguistic diversity, with each language having its unique cultural significance. Making Hindi the sole national language could marginalize other languages and promote a sense of linguistic superiority, which might lead to regional tensions. 2. Endangering minority languages: The promotion of Hindi as the sole national language may lead to a decline in the use of regional and minority languages, weakening their cultural significance and potentially leading to their extinction. 3. Economic considerations: English is also an official language in India, and many industries rely on it for their international dealings. Shifting to Hindi as the primary language could create challenges in trade and commerce, especially in the international context. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? Answer: No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 seeks information about the national language of a given country, which in this case is India, and has a definite answer – Hindi. Meanwhile, question 2 asks for an opinion on whether Hindi should be made the national language of India. This question invites a debate and subjective viewpoints, weighing the pros and cons of such a decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Its provincial capital is Halifax. Nova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province, with an area of , including Cape Breton and another 3,800 coastal islands. As of 2011, the population was 921,727, making Nova Scotia the second most-densely populated province in Canada with almost . - Halifax Fairview is a former provincial electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada which existed from 1993-2013. It elected one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. In its last configuration, the electoral district included the communities of Fairview, Armdale, Cowie Hill, Fairmount and Kline Heights - all within the Halifax Regional Municipality. - The Nova Scotia New Democratic Party is a social-democratic provincial party in Nova Scotia, Canada. It is aligned with the federal New Democratic Party (NDP). It was founded as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in 1932, and became the New Democratic Party in 1961. It became the governing party of Nova Scotia following the 2009 Nova Scotia election. It is the first New Democratic Party in Atlantic Canada to form a government. Much of the party's success prior to the 2009 election was based in the urban areas of the provincial capital, Halifax, however the party's support has grown to the rest of Nova Scotia. - Manitoba is a province at the longitudinal centre of Canada. It is one of the three prairie provinces (with Alberta and Saskatchewan) and Canada's fifth-most populous province with its estimated 1.3 million people. Manitoba covers with a widely varied landscape. The province is bordered by the provinces of Ontario to the east and Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. - Atlantic Canada is the region of Canada comprising the four provinces located on the Atlantic coast, excluding Quebec: the three Maritime provinces New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia and the easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of the four Atlantic provinces in 2011 was about 2,300,000 on half a million km. - The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) (from 1955 the \\"\\") was a social-democratic and democratic socialist political party in Canada. The CCF was founded in 1932 in Calgary, Alberta, by a number of socialist, agrarian, co-operative, and labour groups, and the League for Social Reconstruction. In 1944, the CCF formed the first social-democratic government in North America when it was elected to form the provincial government in Saskatchewan. In 1961, the CCF was succeeded by the New Democratic Party (NDP). The full, but little used, name of the party was Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (Farmer-Labour-Socialist). - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - Graham Steele ( July 8 , 1964 , Winnipeg , Manitoba ) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician , having represented the constituency of Halifax Fairview in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 2001 - 2013 for the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party .

Learn about the behaviors of autistic individuals. Understand the importance of routine. Recognize the power of special interests. Get to know this person's strengths, differences, and challenges. Rid yourself of stereotypes about autistic individuals.\\"","completion":"Title: Understanding and Supporting Autistic Individuals: Emotional, Social, and Behavioral Aspects Introduction Autism, a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by differences in social communication, sensory processing, and behavior, affects millions of people worldwide. As awareness and acceptance of autism spectrum disorder grow, it is imperative to recognize the unique emotional and social challenges autistic individuals face. By having a comprehensive understanding of their behaviors, routine, and special interests, we can promote empathy, support their strengths, and break down stereotypes. 1. Recognizing the emotional challenges autistic people face Autistic individuals often have different ways of experiencing and expressing emotions, which may lead to misunderstandings with others. They may struggle with emotional regulation, making it difficult to manage strong feelings such as anxiety or frustration. It is essential to acknowledge emotional challenges that autistic people face, and provide them with a supportive environment that promotes healthy emotional growth. 2. Learning about the social challenges Autism affects how individuals interact with others. It may also cause differences in understanding body language, facial expressions, and social cues. Autistic people might find it challenging to maintain eye contact or engage in conversations, which may lead to isolation and feelings of loneliness. By learning about these social challenges, we can create more inclusive spaces that accommodate the social needs of autistic individuals. 3. Understanding the behaviors of autistic individuals Autistic people may engage in behaviors such as stimming (self-stimulatory behavior), echolalia (repeating sounds or words), or intense focus on specific interests. These behaviors often help autistic individuals cope with stress or sensory input and enable them to express themselves. Recognizing the purpose behind these behaviors can help us support autistic individuals in managing their needs and create a positive environment. 4. Acknowledging the importance of routine Routine and predictability are crucial for many autistic people. Routines provide a sense of security and structure, making it easier to deal with unfamiliar or overwhelming situations. Disruptions in routine can cause anxiety and distress, so it is essential to be mindful of their routines and support them in maintaining consistency. 5. Embracing the power of special interests Many autistic individuals develop strong interests, known as special interests, which often become an essential part of their identity. These interests can be therapeutic, providing an avenue for connection, relaxation, and self-expression. By recognizing the power of special interests, we can better understand the passions and talents of autistic people and help them channel their interests into meaningful activities. 6. Appreciating individual strengths, differences, and challenges Autism is a highly varied and individualized condition, with each individual having their unique set of strengths, differences, and challenges. It is crucial to respect and appreciate the uniqueness of autistic individuals, as understanding their distinct perspectives and abilities can help us provide the right support tailored to their needs. 7. Abandoning stereotypes about autistic individuals Stereotypes about autism - such as lack of empathy or intelligence - are not only inaccurate but harmful. Dispelling these stereotypes and embracing the diversity within the autism community help create a more inclusive society where autistic individuals can thrive. Conclusion As we continue to learn about autism and promote acceptance, it is crucial to recognize the emotional and social challenges autistic individuals face, understand their behaviors, and appreciate the importance of routine and special interests. With empathy, respect, and support, we can empower autistic individuals to live fulfilling lives while embracing their unique strengths and breaking down stereotypes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Eric John Wilson ( born February 21 , 1970 ) , is the former bass player for Sublime ( 1988 -- 1996 ) and also bassist for Long Beach Dub Allstars ( 1997 -- 2002 ) . He was the bassist for the band Long Beach Shortbus which was composed of several members of Long Beach Dub Allstars and Sublime . Since 2009 , Wilson has been the bassist for Sublime with Rome , a reunited version of Sublime with a new singer . - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - Long Beach Shortbus was a reggae-influenced punk band from Long Beach, California. The band consists of four regular members: RAS-1 (lead vocals and guitar), Trey Pangborn (guitar), Eric Wilson (bass guitar) and Damion Ramirez (drums). Shortbus originated as a side project of RAS-1 and Eric Wilson, eventually taking shape after the Long Beach Dub Allstars disbanded in 2002. - The Long Beach Dub Allstars are a dub/ska/rock band formed in 1997 and disbanded in 2002, but reformed 10 years later. - Ska (Jamaican ) is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the off-beat. Ska developed in Jamaica in the 1960s when Prince Buster, Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, and Duke Reid formed sound systems to play American rhythm & blues and then began recording their own songs. Some suggest ska dates to earlier times, however. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods. Later it became popular with many skinheads.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, that is not the correct answer to your question. The information you found on Google refers to the powers of the House of Representatives as a whole, not the constitutional leadership position within the House. The correct answer to your question is the Speaker of the House. The Speaker of the House of Representatives is the only constitutional leadership position mentioned specifically within the U.S. Constitution. According to Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the Constitution, \\"The House of Representatives shall chuse [sic] their Speaker and other Officers.\\" The Speaker acts as the presiding officer and is responsible for overseeing the proceedings in the House, including managing debates and recognizing members to speak. The Speaker of the House of Representatives plays a crucial role in conducting the legislative business of the House. Some key responsibilities of the Speaker include: 1. Presiding over meetings and sessions of the House and maintaining order during debates. 2. Deciding on procedural matters and referring bills and resolutions to appropriate committees, which ultimately influences the legislative process. 3. Managing the legislative calendar by scheduling the consideration of bills and resolutions. 4. Representing the House in its relations with the Senate, the President, and other branches of government. 5. Overseeing various House administrative offices, such as the Clerk of the House, the Sergeant at Arms, and the Chief Administrative Officer. Additionally, in the line of presidential succession, the Speaker of the House stands second in line after the Vice President. This means that if both the President and Vice President are unable to serve, the Speaker of the House would be next in line to assume the presidency. It is important to note that a Speaker is elected at the beginning of each new Congress, typically representing the majority party within the House of Representatives."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Pacing and Pausing Sara tried to befriend her old friend Steve's new wife, but Betty never seemed to have anything to say. While Sara felt Betty didn't hold up her end of the conversation, Betty complained to Steve that Sara never gave her a chance to talk. The problem had to do with expectations about pacing and pausing. Conversation is a turn-taking game. When our habits are similar, there's no problem. But if our habits are different, you may start to talk before I'm finished or fail to take your turn when I'm finished. That's what was happening with Betty and Sara. It may not be coincidental that Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British, and Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American. Betty often felt interrupted by Sara. But Betty herself became an interrupter and found herself doing most of the talking when she met a visitor from Finland. And Sara had a hard time cutting in on some speakers from Latin America or Israel. The general phenomenon, then, is that the small conversation techniques, like pacing and pausing, lead people to draw conclusions not about conversational style but about personality and abilities. These habitual differences are often the basis for dangerous stereotyping . And these social phenomena can have very personal consequences. For example, a woman from the southwestern part of the US went to live in an eastern city to take up a job in personnel. When the Personnel Department got together for meetings, she kept searching for the right time to break in -- and never found it. Although back home she was considered outgoing and confident, in Washington she was viewed as shy and retiring. When she was evaluated at the end of the year, she was told to take a training course because of her inability to speak up. That's why slight differences in conversational style -- tiny little things like microseconds of pause -- can have a great effect on one's life. The result in this cause was a judgment of psychological problems -- even in the mind of... Question: What did Sara think of Betty when talking with her? Options: A: Betty was talkative. B: Betty was an interrupter. C: Betty did not take her turn. D: Betty paid no attention to Sara.

On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit.

В частности, согласно научным прогнозам и исследованиям, глобальная средняя температура на Земле возрастет в пределах от 1,4 до 5,8 градусов Цельсия. Такой рост температуры приведет к множеству негативных проявлений и экологических катастроф. Во-первых, ускорится таяние полярных льдов и ледников, что спровоцирует значительный рост уровня мирового океана. В результате, некоторые прибрежные города и населенные пункты могут быть затоплены. Во-вторых, изменение климата повлияет на погодные условия, сельское хозяйство и процессы, происходящие в экосистемах. Мы можем столкнуться с более частыми и интенсивными погодными явлениями, такими как ураганы, сильные дожди и засухи.

Рост температуры способствует размножению вредных насекомых-переносчиков инфекционных заболеваний, а также создает условия для распространения патогенных микроорганизмов.

Generate a sentence that includes all the following words: building, foundation, site","completion":"The architects and construction team convened on the site of the proposed project, meticulously inspecting the area where the building's foundation would be established, knowing well that this initial step, creating a solid and reliable base, was paramount for the integrity and safety of the monumental structure they were tasked to erect. As the cornerstone to a successful project, the foundation needed to be carefully planned, ensuring it would adequately support the weight of the proposed building, balancing both aesthetic appeal and structural practicality. Furthermore, they knew that their choice of foundation would profoundly impact the structure's ability to withstand various environmental factors, such as seismic activity and soil erosion. Soil tests were conducted, as understanding the nature of the site's ground composition is crucial for determining the type of foundation best suited for the building. Different kinds of foundations such as shallow or deep were considered, each with its own benefits and limitations. Shallow foundations are often chosen for sites with hard soil, and when the building’s load does not necessitate deep penetration. On the contrary, deep foundations can be chosen in case the top soil layer is not strong enough to sustain the load of the building. As they worked tirelessly, their minds raced with intricate calculations, each knowing their professional reputation, and more importantly, the safety of those who would work, live, or simply spend time in the completed building hung in the balance. Yet, the responsibility didn't overwhelm them; instead, it motivated them to strive for excellence. Each day on the site brought them one step closer to seeing the building rise from its carefully designed foundation - a testament to their painstaking work, expertise, and commitment to quality and safety. Indeed, the process of laying the foundation on a building site is much more than just a physical act; it is a science that requires meticulous planning and execution, and a thorough understanding of the relationship between the building, its foundation, and the site on which it is built. It's a collaborative endeavour, bringing together diverse professionals - architects, engineers, contractors, and laborers - who tirelessly work together to translate intricate architectural designs into tangible structures, built on firm and reliable foundations, truly embodying the saying 'well begun is half done'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rayo could not handle the partnership at the Nou Camp with all three goals coming from the pair, Villa opening the scoring and Messi scoring twice before Raul Tamudo grabbed a consolation. Victory helped Barcelona restore their 13-point lead over Real Madrid at the top of La Liga and Roura felt moved to categorically dismiss reports of bad feeling between the two. \\"This issue of a conflict I have heard many times - it is absurd,\\" said Roura, who is deputizing for Tito Vilanova as he continues to recover from cancer surgery in New York. \\"Currently the relationship between the two is just like it was a few months ago.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person whose actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government? from the following article ? The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's...

'There is no feeling better than the unconditional love of an animal, especially when that animal is a cheetah who you love with all of your heart.' Describing how she originally gained the big cat's trust, Heather says: 'Dew would slowly come closer and closer to me, to get used to my smell, my voice. 'I always talk to her. She is the best listener and is always keen to hear about my day and how beautiful she looks. Trust: Dew is completely comfortable with her human companion, who in turn feels just as relaxed. Walkies: Cheetah Experience was founded in 2006 with the sole aim of saving the cheetahs from extinction. 'The time when our bond was cemented was when I spent the night with her in the little house in her enclosure. 'She came and lay on me and stole my pillow to rest on and purred until we both slept arm-in-arm. 'Falling asleep to the sound of a cheetah purring with her head resting on mine, underneath a blanket of stars and a bright moon is a moment I will never forget. 'When I look into her eyes, I feel safe and at home.' Feline the love: Heather sunbathes with Dew, her sister Dawn and another cheetah friend. Cheetahs are Africa's most threatened big cats and the world's fastest land animals, reaching up to 75 mph. Cheetah Experience was founded in 2006 by Riana Van Nieuwenhuizen with the sole aim of saving the cheetahs from extinction. Currently Africa's most threatened big cats, cheetahs are the world's fastest land animals and can reach speeds of up to 75mph. Unlike the other big cats, they are not known for attacking humans, though freak cases have been reported, such as an incident involving the comic actor, Adam Sandler, last year. When the Happy Gilmore actor was on safari, he was lucky enough to get the opportunity to get up close to a cheetah, at a private lodge. But when he lent a little too close, the animal pounced. Luckily, he was rescued by a handler. 'When I look into her eyes, I feel safe and at home,' says Heather of her friendship with the young cheetah. A roarsome friendship: Heather says volunteering at the Cheetah Experience changed her life. Meanwhile, Dew may eventually be released into a protected wild situation where there will be little human contact but she will be monitored by professionals. 'Volunteering at Cheetah Experience has changed my life completely. I have learnt so much about animals, conservation, but also about life and love,' Heather said. 'Working with wild animals, especially big cats, had always been a lifelong dream of mine. I truly lost my heart to the project, the people and of course the animals.

However, there is a simple solution to prevent this issue: waterproofing your shoes with a sealant spray. But why stop there? You can also add decorative touches to revamp your shoes and take them for a test walk to ensure their comfort and sturdiness! In this article, we will provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to help you waterproof, personalize, and properly test your shoes. Step 1: Choose the Right Sealant Spray Before you begin the process, it is important to choose the appropriate sealant spray for your shoes. There are different types of spray available, such as silicone-based or acrylic-based. Consider the materials of your shoes and pick a suitable waterproof spray that works well with those materials. You can find sealant sprays in most shoe stores or online markets. Step 2: Prepare Your Shoes To ensure the best results, make sure to thoroughly clean your shoes before applying the sealant spray. This allows the spray to adhere better to the material. Remove any dirt or dust particles using a cloth, and allow the shoes to dry completely before moving on to the next step. Step 3: Apply the Sealant Spray Once your shoes are clean and dry, you can apply the sealant spray. Follow the instructions provided on the spray bottle and evenly coat the entire shoe surface. It is important to apply the spray in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling any harmful fumes. Allow the sealant to dry for the recommended time provided by the manufacturer. This will ensure that the sealant fully bonds to the shoe materials, providing reliable waterproofing. Step 4: Add Decorative Touches Now that your shoes are waterproof, you can move on to the fun part – adding decorative touches! There are endless ways to personalize your shoes, so use your creativity and imagination to make them uniquely yours. You can use fabric paint, stitching or embroidery techniques, or even sew on patches or appliqués. Make sure that the decorations you add do not compromise the waterproofing of your shoes. Step 5: Take Your Shoes for a Test Walk Once your shoes are dry and all your decorations are securely in place, it's time to take them for a test walk. This will ensure that your shoes are comfortable, and the sealant and decorations are properly set in place. It's also a great opportunity to show off your new and improved shoes! Walk around your neighborhood or go for a short hike to test how your shoes hold up in different environments. Check for any discomfort or signs of wear that need addressing. Conclusion Waterproofing your shoes with a sealant spray not only adds a protective layer to your footwear but can also be an excellent opportunity to personalize them with decorative touches. Following this step-by-step guide, you'll be able to turn heads with your unique, waterproof shoes. So, gear up and confidently step into any terrain without worrying about your shoes getting wet or damaged. Happy walking!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874 July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state. - The Canadian federal election of 1940 was the 19th general election in Canadian history . It was held March 26 , 1940 , to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 19th Parliament of Canada . Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King 's Liberal Party was re-elected to their second consecutive majority government . The election was overshadowed by the Second World War , which caused many Canadians to rally around the government . In response to this , the Conservative Party of Robert Manion ran on a platform advocating the creation of an all - party national unity government and ran under the name \`\` National Government '' in this election . Though Manion was personally opposed to conscription , the Liberals faced intense pressure in Quebec on the question and promised not to institute the measure . This promise was to haunt the Liberals as they faced increasing pressure from the military and especially from English Canada to bring in the measure . To release him from his 1940 promise , King called a plebiscite in 1942 on the question . See also Conscription Crisis of 1944 . It was the most successful election for the Liberal Party in its history , in which it captured 73 % of seats in the House of Commons . Social Credit ran jointly with the New Democracy movement of William Duncan Herridge . Some candidates of the Conservative and Social Credit parties insisted on running under the traditional names , however .

Write some highlights for the following article: Raging clashes between police and protesters in Egypt on Saturday left two people dead and 750 injured, the Health Ministry reported, prompting a call from a prominent grass-roots group for citizens to resist the military-led government. The April 6 Movement, which figured prominently in the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak this year, issued a statement urging its members to descend on Cairo's Tahrir Square \\"immediately because resistance is the only solution.\\" \\"Down with military rule,\\" the movement said. The fighting erupted earlier in the day when police worked to clear the area of people who remained in the square after Friday's massive protests in Tahrir. Tens of thousands of Egyptians turned out Friday to protest plans for a constitution that would shield the military from public oversight. As evening came Saturday, police blanketed the square and fired tear gas. The security forces soon withdrew and stationed themselves at the Interior Ministry. Warning shots were heard throughout the day. Thousands of protesters remained at the scene. They chanted against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which rules Egypt, and Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the head of the council who is effectively the interim ruler of Egypt. Protesters threw Molotov cocktails and rocks and torched a police van. Scuffles broke out on side streets and clouds of smoke rose from burned tires, witnesses said. Clashes between protesters and police also reportedly broke out in the cities of Suez and Alexandria. Two people died after being shot -- one in Cairo, one in Alexandria -- said Adel al-Dawi, a spokesman for the Health Ministry. State media reported that 750 people were injured, citing the Health Ministry. The Interior Ministry also said 20 police officers have been injured and eight people have been arrested. \\"We sent hundreds of Central Security Police Forces and forced out the remaining several hundred protesters who refused to go home. We arrested four thieves and thugs who acted aggressively and beefed up security in and around square overnight,\\" Interior spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said earlier Saturday. The Cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss the recent clashes and warned they could have a dangerous impact on Egypt, state media said. The Friday throng, dominated by Islamist parties but including secular protesters as well, turned out ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections set to begin on November 28. Mahmoud said the \\"Islamists and revolutionaries had left as they promised not to have a sit-in.\\" But stragglers remained, and he said many of the people who stayed in the square were families of those injured during the upheaval earlier this year that led to Mubarak's departure and the ushering in of the supreme council as interim rulers. Yousri Hamad, the official spokesman of the Al Noor Salafi Muslim political party, said he thinks that the violence could affect election plans. \\"The protesters are a bunch of kids that attacked the security forces which is a red line and could delay elections,\\" Hamad said. The military said it wants to transfer power to a civilian parliament and president, but many citizens are dissatisfied with the pace of the transition and the resolve of the military rulers. But protesters were upset Friday about proposed principles for the constitution, in which the military's budget would not be scrutinized by civilian powers. They worry that the military would be shaped as a state within a state. The outpouring reflected the power of Islamist forces in Egypt, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party. A leader of that group called for restraint in the wake of Saturday's clashes, state media reported. The demonstrations occurred a day after hundreds of Coptic Christians marching in Cairo were attacked by unknown assailants. At least 32 people, including two police officers, were injured. They were heading to Cairo's Tahrir Square to commemorate the deaths of pro-Coptic protesters killed in clashes in the Egyptian capital last month. Problems between Egypt's Muslim majority and the Copts have been on the rise in recent months, with a number of violent clashes reported between the two groups. Protests also stretched to the United States on Saturday, where demonstrators gathered in the nation's capital in opposition to military rule in Egypt. Protester Amin Mahmoud, a member of a group called the \\"Egyptian Organization for Change USA,\\" said Egypt's military \\"has been taking civilians before military courts, and we are against that. \\"They are torturing a lot of young revolutionaries, accusing them of being traitors, and that is not true,\\" he said. CNN's Alexander Hunter contributed to this report.","completion":"There were very big fights between the police and protesters in Egypt.

The protesters were not happy with the military government because they want more control in Egypt. They also didn't like the idea of the military's budget being secret. Many people think this fighting could make the upcoming elections difficult. The government wants to give power to the people but it is taking a long time and people are getting impatient.

Dark clouds started rolling in, signaling an approaching storm. The atmosphere was heavy with the scent of rain, and the first droplets began hitting the ground as the girls hesitated. Should they continue or should they retreat? Lisa, the older and more confident of the two, decided that they wouldn't let a bit of rain dampen their spirits. Maddie, her younger sister, carried their brightly colored rainbow kite with both excitement and trepidation. As they approached the large expanse of the park, they noticed that other people had left, seeking shelter from the storm. This only excited them further as now they would have the whole space to themselves. They sprinted to the center of the park, where the sturdiest trees stood, seeking protection from the wind and the rain. Before they could unravel the kite, a loud clap of thunder shook the air, making both girls startle and catch their breath. This was turning into a more significant storm than they had anticipated. Lisa and Maddie exchanged worried glances, but neither wanted to be the first to give up. Ignoring their nagging doubts, Lisa unraveled the kite, as Maddie held onto it tightly. With a final nod of assurance, they began to run together, trying to catch the swift gusts of wind that the storm brought. The kite soared into the air, dancing wildly against the dark clouds, and the rain started falling more heavily. The girls, soaked to the bone, laughed with glee and surprise at their defiance of the weather. They continued maneuvering the kite as best as they could, battling the storm like it was an exhilarating adventure. The wind howled, tugging the kite vigorously as the sisters tried hard not to lose control. Just as the girls were getting the hang of the powerful gusts and guiding their kite smoothly, a deafening boom of thunder cracked the sky, illuminating their surroundings with bright, blinding light. Seconds later, a bolt of lightning struck close to their location, making both of them jump back frightfully. Realization finally hit them that perhaps they were out of their depth. The sisters looked fearfully at one another, soaked and shivering, their clothes sticking to their bodies. What had begun as a lighthearted attempt at thrill-seeking had now turned into a dangerous pursuit, and they knew it was time to seek shelter. They relinquished their grip on the kite, watching it carried away by the fierce wind. Lisa held Maddie's hand tightly as they hurried back from where they had come, bounding over puddles and navigating slippery paths. The euphoria of earlier was replaced by pounding hearts and anxious breaths, as they felt the urgency of finding safety. Upon reaching home, battered by the storm but relieved to be in the warm shelter, they huddled under their mother's embrace. As their shivering faded away and the rain outside softened to a gentle patter, the sisters recounted their adventure to their parents, describing the highs and lows they encountered in the park. Their parents, torn between being glad the girls had bonded in such a way and worried about their safety, reminded them of the importance of recognizing and respecting nature's force. Despite their understanding and somewhat sheepish agreement, the girls couldn't help but admit privately to one another that they would always cherish that wild day when they had chased the storm and dared to fly a kite against the odds."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is Jim Block going to watch? Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.

Truth can often be stranger than fiction as a story that could have come straight out of The Game of Thrones illustrates. 580 years ago today, 21 February 1437, James I of Scotland was brutally murdered by Sir Robert Graham, an acolyte of the Earl of Atholl, in a bloody struggle for the Scottish throne. In the aftermath the Queen, Joan Beaufort, who survived the attack, wreaked a terrifying retribution upon the traitors in one of the most brutal, savage and grisly acts of revenge Scotland had seen. James and his wife Joan were both buried in Perth’s ‘Charterhouse’, a monastery of Carthusian monks which he had commissioned as a showcase and future mausoleum for his dynasty. A century later, the sister of Henry VIII of England, Margaret Tudor, consort of King James IV of Scotland, was also buried here. Today, 21 February 2017, experts in archaeology, Scottish history and 3d visualisation from the University of Stirling, The University of the Highlands and Islands and the School of Simulation and Visualisation at The Glasgow School of Art announced a joint venture that seeks to locate the Charterhouse site – and the tombs within it – and recreate it as a virtual museum for the 21st century. Project lead Professor Richard Oram, Dean of Arts and Humanities at the University of Stirling, said: “Perth’s Charterhouse was unique in Scotland. James built it to be the spiritual focus of his dynasty and poured huge sums of money into it to create a splendid setting for his tomb. Medieval descriptions speak of the magnificence of the church, but nothing of it remains above ground to be seen today – the whole monastery was plundered and demolished at the Reformation. “Working with our archaeology colleagues and the wider community in Perth, we aim to locate the Charterhouse buildings and recover as much of their plan as possible to allow us to ‘build’ a virtual reconstruction of the complex and restore the jewel in the crown of the city’s lost medieval heritage. Unearthing this almost forgotten building will transform understanding of Perth’s place in James I’s ambitions: locating the royal tombs within the church would be the icing on the cake.” The Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands has an exceptional reputation for innovation in research, public history and the provision of higher education. One of the university’s thirteen partner colleges is the vibrant campus at Perth. Dr Lucy Dean, the newest member of the Centre for History team at the University of the Highlands and Islands and co-investigator on the project, adds: “In the early fifteenth century, Perth was at the geographical heart of the country, a few miles from the inaugural site of Scottish kings, and the setting for parliaments, exchequers, church courts, royal ceremonial, and a bustling hub for trade in the later fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries. The murder of James I was a pivotal moment that saw a rapid end to Perth’s status. The Charterhouse Project will allow the local, national and world communities the opportunity to discover and re-discover the fascinating history of this lost capital through innovative research and delivery methods. Moreover, both the research and the products it will produce will offer innovative educational tools and involvement for all levels from primary to high education and beyond.” The Glasgow School of Art’s School of Simulation and Visualisation is in the forefront of 3D visualisation and virtual reality in projects including the Scottish Ten (with Historic Environment Scotland) and the Definitive Human Anatomy (with Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and NES). Project lead at SimVis, Paul Wilson, said: “The Charterhouse Project offers the opportunity to use state of the art 3D visualisation techniques to bring this exciting period of history to life, and to create a vivid sensory experience of James I’s burial place in 360 / 3D Super High definition which would be accessible across a range of different platforms and devices.” The public will have a chance to learn more about the project on Saturday 25 February 2017 through a digital presentation at Perth Museum and Gallery (10am – 12 noon). A walking tour of the city (12.30pm -2pm) will offer the opportunity to hear about King James I’s dreams to make Perth the capital of Scotland, how these were violently ended in 1437, and how archaeological and historical research are helping to tell the story.

Who was James I and why don't we know where he's buried? James I of Scotland was a complex and colourful king. He was a poet, a sportsman, a musician and a patron of architects. He survived being kidnapped by pirates when he was just 12 years old - and the following 18 years he spent as a hostage to the Lancastrian kings of England. In 1424, he made a triumphant return to Scotland and was crowned at Scone, but 13 years later he was brutally stabbed to death, his body dumped in the sewer below the Blackfriars monastery in Perth. Young prince in danger James Stewart was born in 1394, the third son of King Robert III and Annabella Drummond. By the time he was eight years old, he was their only surviving son. His brother Robert died in infancy and his other brother David, the Duke of Rothesay, died in suspicious circumstances at Falkland Castle while he was being detained by his uncle Robert, the Duke of Albany. After David's death, James was the heir to the Scottish throne, but he was also an impediment to the royal line being transferred to the Albany Stewarts. Fears grew for his safety and plans were made to send him to France. In March 1406, he boarded a boat bound for France, but just days into the voyage, the vessel was intercepted in the English Channel by pirates who delivered him to Henry IV of England. Eighteen years a hostage On 4 April 1406, Robert III died and the 12-year-old James was now the uncrowned King of Scots. But he was imprisoned in England and his uncle, the Duke of Albany, became regent in Scotland. James may have been a prisoner, but he was allowed to keep a small household and was treated well by Henry IV. This lasted until 1413 when Henry IV died, his son Henry V became king, and James was transferred to the Tower of London with other Scottish prisoners. It took another seven years before James' standing improved enough for him to be regarded more of a guest than a hostage - but it took a third change of monarch in England before James was finally allowed back to Scotland. Henry V died in 1422, and the regency council for the infant Henry VI were eager to organise his release as soon as possible. Despite opposition from the Albany Stewarts, it was arranged for 1424 when he arrived triumphantly in Edinburgh on Palm Sunday, accompanied by his newly-wed English wife, Joan Beaufort. Coronation and assassination James I was crowned King of Scotland at Scone on 21 May 1424. Prominent members of the Albany Stewarts were found guilty of rebellion and executed, but a conspiracy against the King began to grow and he reigned for just 13 years before his death. On 4 February 1437, the King and Queen were in their royal apartments at the Blackfriars monastery in Perth, when a group of about 30 people was let in by one of the conspirators against him. James I was alerted and had enough time to hide in a sewer tunnel, but his exit was blocked and he was trapped and killed. He died in a pool of his own blood, stabbed dozens of times. The assassin, Sir Robert Graham, is said to have screamed after his death: \\"I have thus slayne and delivered yow of so crewel a tyrant, the grettest enemye that Scottes or Scotland might have.\\" James I was buried within the grounds of Perth Charterhouse, but the priory was destroyed in the reformation a century after his death and now no-one is exactly sure where his grave is. A stone monument at the corner of Perth's King Street and Hospital Street marks the fact he is buried somewhere in the area. Discovering the murdered King's exact location would be a major historical find - and a coup for the city of Perth. ||||| A bid to locate the body of James I of Scotland has been launched in Perth — 580 years to the day after his brutal murder. It has long been known than an elaborate tomb for the king was housed in the city’s Charterhouse monastery but the exact location has been lost in the mists of time. Now academics from across Scotland have joined forces with Perth’s archaeology, heritage and cultural bodies to locate and virtually recreate the lost tombs and buildings from one of the most bloody chapters of local history. Project lead Professor Richard Oram, dean of arts and humanities at the University of Stirling, said: “Perth’s Charterhouse was unique in Scotland. “James built it to be the spiritual focus of his dynasty and poured huge sums of money into it to create a splendid setting for his tomb. “Medieval descriptions speak of the magnificence of the church, but nothing of it remains above ground to be seen today – the whole monastery was plundered and demolished at the Reformation. “Working with our archaeology colleagues and the wider community in Perth, we aim to locate the Charterhouse buildings and recover as much of their plan as possible to allow us to ‘build’ a virtual reconstruction of the complex and restore the jewel in the crown of the city’s lost medieval heritage. “Unearthing this almost forgotten building will transform understanding of Perth’s place in James I’s ambitions — locating the royal tombs within the church would be the icing on the cake.” A search of archives and the use of ground penetrating radar to locate the buildings will be followed by archaeological test pit digs.

A walking tour of the city from 12.30pm to 2pm will help the understanding of King James I’s dreams to make Perth the capital of Scotland and how these were violently ended on February 21 1437. * For more on this story see Wednesday’s Courier, also available as a digital edition. ||||| Experts say the story is like a real-life version of 'Game of Thrones', the hit medieval fantasy series from HBO, a prop of which is pictured here The tomb of a medieval king whose murder changed the course of Scottish history in a real-life \\"Game of Thrones\\" could be unearthed in a new hi-tech project launched Saturday. Archaeologists and virtual reality artists want to digitally recreate the court of King James I of Scotland in Perth, around 40 miles (64 kilometres) from Edinburgh, and try to find the king's tomb buried beneath the modern-day city. They are also looking for the remains of his queen, Joan Beaufort, and of Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII of England and wife of James IV of Scotland, who was also buried there a century later. The team has been inspired by the discovery of King Richard III of England beneath a car park in Leicester. \\"It's like 'Game of Thrones' and 'Outlander' all rolled into one—except this story is real,\\" said Paul Wilson, who is leading the digital visualisation project at Glasgow School of Art (GSA). James I was assassinated on February 21, 1437, by supporters of a rival claimant to the throne, an act which historians say brought an end to his ambition to make Perth the capital of Scotland. \\"That day changed Scotland forever,\\" Wilson said. The king's mausoleum lay at the heart of a Carthusian priory called the Charterhouse, which was modelled on the Grande Chartreuse in the French Alps. The team is planning archaeological digs over the next two years to map out the Charterhouse boundaries and recover artefacts, which will then be used to create a virtual reality tour.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is one sentence: Give thought to. Here is another sentence: I gave two sons to the war. Does the term give mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"In the two sentences provided, the term \\"give\\" is used with different meanings due to the context in which they appear. In the first sentence, \\"Give thought to,\\" the term \\"give\\" is used to mean devoting or directing one's attention, time, or effort to something. In this context, to \\"give thought to\\" implies that one should consider or think carefully about the matter at hand. This meaning of \\"give\\" is more abstract and suggests a mental or emotional contribution rather than a tangible one. In the second sentence, \\"I gave two sons to the war,\\" the term \\"give\\" is used in a different sense, conveying the meaning of presenting or offering something as a gift or sacrifice. Here, the speaker is indicating that they have lost two of their sons who participated in a war, and as a result, the implication is that their sons were given away, or sacrificed, for the cause of the war. This context reflects a more concrete sense of giving, as it involves the offering of something (or someone) with a tangible existence, such as the sons in this case. In conclusion, although the term \\"give\\" is used in both sentences, it carries distinct meanings due to the contextual differences. In the first sentence, \\"give\\" pertains to the allocation of mental effort or consideration, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of presenting or offering something, often with a sense of sacrifice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jacob Cook, 30, from Woodhall Spa, unwittingly spent four months chatting online with an undercover officer posing as a 13-year-old school girl. During the chats, Cook offered to talk the girl through \\"her first masturbation\\" and \\"take her virginity\\". He was jailed for three years at Lincoln Crown Court. Cook, a university graduate, believed he was chatting to a \\"bored\\" 13-year old called \\"Tiny Dancer\\" on the Kik app. Mark Watson, prosecuting, said Cook made sexually explicit suggestions to the girl after asking about her experiences of sex. The defendant told the girl he was a rugby coach, and referred to himself as a teacher in a bid to \\"gain a degree of trust from her\\", he added. \\"It is perfectly plain that he believed he was talking to a schoolgirl,\\" Mr Watson said.

A: The answer is:","completion":"Looking directly at the Sun, which is a celestial object, can cause blindness. The Sun is a vast and powerful source of light and energy, being the primary source of warmth and light for our planet Earth. It is an immense, continuously burning ball of gas, primarily consisting of hydrogen and helium, undergoing nuclear fusion in its core. It is located at the center of our Solar System, with all planets and celestial bodies revolving around it. Observing the Sun with the naked eye, especially during its peak hours, can cause temporary or permanent damage to your eyesight, including blindness. The reason is that the Sun emits a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including ultraviolet rays (UV), which can harm the eye's delicate tissues, such as the retina or the lens. Looking directly at the Sun, even for a brief period, can induce a condition called solar retinopathy, which results from the excess intake of solar energy by the eye's retina. Solar retinopathy can lead to varying degrees of visual impairment, from temporary light sensitivity and afterimages to permanent blindness. Moreover, the pain receptors in the retina are usually absent, meaning that the damage caused may go unnoticed at first, and its symptoms are only identified later on. Solar eclipses are particularly dangerous in this regard. When an eclipse happens, the Moon partially or completely blocks the Sun's disk, leading people to believe that it's safe to stare directly at it. However, even during an eclipse, the Sun's edges emit potent UV rays, capable of leading to severe, irreversible eye damage. To prevent eye injury caused by direct solar observation, it is crucial to take the necessary precautions, such as using specialized viewers or filters, like solar eclipse glasses, which are designed to block out the harmful rays. Another safe option is the projection method, such as a pinhole projector, which allows you to indirectly watch the event without facing the risks associated with staring at the Sun. It is worth noting that using ordinary sunglasses, smoked glass, or other makeshift filters is dangerous, as they may not provide adequate protection. In conclusion, the celestial object that looking at directly can cause blindness is the Sun. Staring at the Sun without proper protection can have disastrous consequences on your eyes, such as temporary or permanent visual impairment, including solar retinopathy and blindness. To ensure your safety, always use appropriate protection, such as solar eclipse glasses or indirect viewing methods, when observing this powerful celestial body."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Overall spent 300 for an experience that was hyped up to be the best experience. At least that's wasn't what was shown on the advertisement my nephew saw. That is the only reason we all wanted to go as a family. What did we really get? RFID bracelet that didn't work. Why make us spend multiple time registering. In the end, the games showed me up as some 8 yr old white kids. The Hulk game and Iron man game were not even sync or calibrated. Whats the point of waiting in line to training and no be able to do anything except crash into the mountain or not even move the hulk. You should invest in a XBOX. At least they know how to get those game working The only good game was the laser black widow game. Too bad you only had 1 of them and it also had the longest line. What were you thinking? The 3D? Really? First of all, it didnt work or wasn't 3D to begin with. Then we had to keep looking at the done. Why not just tell us to lay down on the floor? It would have been better than have to keep our neck in that uncomfortable position. The 4D? Great, still no 3D but now our seat gets some movement. I guess it wasn't bad but from the look of the movie, i suspect our faces should have appeared on the screen to be part of the movie BUT since the RFID didn't work, we had some random people I didn't know. I don't think a single person on the screen was in my party. If you wanted us to test out the ride for people in the later day, I understand. But you really shouldn't be charging for that since you didn't get your act together! It should have been free or a greatly reduced price; not the same price as every one else. Oh also you should have mention the 10 parking on the website. Not all of us carry cash. Lucky we had enough change in the car to cover this.

At the conference room table was White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten. Bolten watched the exchanges and, after what he called \\"a quiet moment,\\"suggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order. Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter.

After the terrible car accident, his whole world had been completely dark and quiet for almost ten years. The loss of sight and hearing made him try many times to put end to his life. His family especially his wife did their best to tend and comfort him. By and by he finally regained the courage to live on. On a hot summer afternoon he was taking a walk with a stick near his house when a thunderstorm started suddenly. He stood under a large tree in order not to get himself wet. Unfortunately he was struck down to the ground by a lightning. The witnesses thought him dead but he woke up some 20 minutes later lying face down in muddy water below the tree. He felt that he was trembling badly, but when he opened his eyes ,he didn't dare to believe that he saw a plough( )lying near the wall. When Mrs Edwards came running up to him, she shouted their neighbours for help. And he saw her and heard her voice for the first time in nearly ten years. The news of Robert's regaining his sight and hearing quickly spread in his area. And many doctors came to prove the truth of the news. Most of them said that he gained sight and hearing again obviously from the knock of lightning; none of them could give convincing reasons, however. The only reasonable explanation given by one doctor was that, since Edwards lost his sight and hearing as a result of sudden shock in a terrible accident, perhaps the only way for them to regain was by another sudden shock. What was Edwards doing when he was struck by the lightning? A) Hiding from the rain under a tree. B) Driving a car.

Article:Stefano Poborko, 52, suffered burns in the blast on a Tube train between King's Cross and Aldgate when a suicide bomber detonated a device in 2005. He applied in March 2015 to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) but is still waiting. The CICA said it deals with all applications \\"as quickly as possible\\". On the day of the tube attacks in 2005, Mr Poborka, who now lives in Newbridge, Caerphilly county, was running late for a work meeting, and suffered burns to his back, head and ear in the blast. He said a fellow passenger died in his arms before emergency services arrived. The attack, was one of four explosions targeting three tube trains and a bus and was the worst single terrorist attack on British soil and claimed the lives of 52 people, with 770 more injured. Mr Poborko's condition means he now uses a wheelchair and his fiancÃ©e Louise Britt is also his primary carer. Ten years after the attack, he applied for compensation from the CICA - a government body which compensates people who suffer physical or mental injuries arising from violent crime. But he is still awaiting a decision. Mr Poborko has criticised the length of time taken to determine his case - including delays caused by his medical records being misnamed on CICA's system. CICA said it deals with all applications \\"as quickly and sensitively as possible\\". Recent figures show in 2015-2016, CICA took an average of more than 11 months to reach a first decision on cases - slightly longer than in the previous year. CICA said the increase \\"reflects the changing nature of our caseload\\". Mr Poborko said he hoped to gain compensation as some \\"recognition\\" of what he has been through, and to improve his quality of life by enabling him to buy his home, instead of renting. \\"I want it sorted - it's ridiculous,\\" he said. \\"All I was doing was running late for work, and I got blown up. \\"I just want to get on with my life, with Louise, in our home.\\" Mr Poborko's solicitor, Glyn Maddocks, said although the compensation claim was outside the two-year limit stipulated, CICA had discretion to consider the case. \\"He's entitled to compensation - he was a victim of a crime which was the terrorist outrage on 7 July. \\"He witnessed it, the experiences that he had and what he saw on that day are horrific and life-changing, and he's entitled to receive compensation from the public body because of that.\\" A CICA spokesperson said it could not comment on individual cases, adding: \\"We express our sympathy to all victims of crime and are committed to resolving applications as quickly and sensitively as possible.\\" MS is a condition which affects the brain and/or spinal cord, and symptoms can include problems with vision, limb movement, sensation and balance.

Read this article and answer this question The Azov campaigns demonstrated the significance of having a fleet and marked the beginning of Russia's becoming a maritime power. Russia's success at Azov strengthened its positions during the Karlowitz Congress of 1698-1699 and favored the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople in 1700.As Azov's harbor was not convenient for the military fleet, the Tsar selected another more appropriate site on July 27, 1696, on the cape Tagan-Rog . On September 12, 1698, Taganrog was founded there, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy. Although the campaign was a success, it was evident to Peter I of Russia that he achieved only partial results, since his fleet was bottled up in the Sea of Azov due to Crimean and Ottoman control of the Strait of Kerch. A regular navy and specialists who could build and navigate military ships were necessary for resisting the Ottoman attacks. On October 20, 1696, the Boyar Duma decreed the creation of the regular Imperial Russian Navy; this date is considered to be the birthdate of the Russian Navy. The first shipbuilding program consisted of 52 vessels. In 1697, a Russian ambassador present at the Safavid court raised an issue by handing over a note which stipulated that \\"Lezgi, Circassian, and other Caucasian tribesmen, ostensibly Persian subjects\\", had provided assistance to the Ottomans during the Azov campaigns. The report also included the request to declare war on the Ottomans, as well as to repay some 300,000 tomans to the Russians, which the report asserted were owed to the Tsar \\"since the days of shah Safi\\" .

The keywords here are \\"king\\" and \\"back courtyard.\\" Step 2: Evaluate the options Next, the human would evaluate the options provided: palace, garden, country estate, large house, and suburbs. Step 3: Consider the context In this context, the word \\"king\\" points to royalty. Therefore, the human would automatically be inclined to think about places that royalty typically inhabits. Step 4: Eliminate less fitting options The options such as \\"large house\\" and \\"suburbs\\" seem less fitting for a king, who usually resides in a grand and luxurious place, hence those options could be eliminated by a human. Step 5: Decide based on relevance Between the remaining options \\"palace,\\" \\"garden,\\" and \\"country estate,\\" a palace is the most relevant place for a king as it is the customary royal residence. Although a garden and country estate could be associated with royalty, they are not considered the primary residence for a king. Step 6: Justify the choice Finally, a human would choose \\"palace\\" as the answer because it is the most fitting option among the choices given.

Simon plays in a band and dreams of one day getting paid to write music.

Ruth doesn't hear it and she dismisses it, claiming that his ears are ringing from years of loud music. Jonas' reaction to Simon's ailment is much different than Ruth's. Jonas believes Simon and, after doing some research, believes that what Simon is hearing is in fact a government experiment, which utilizes an ultrasonic auditory signal to control the minds of all who hear it. Simon, with some prodding from Ruth, goes to visit an ear doctor who informs him that his test results show Simon's hearing to be least 6,000 Hz higher than the average human.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

Article: Over the last 30 years, Bangkok, once a small fishing village, has transformed into a rich, concrete, high-rise city that it is today. The spreading metropolis and its population of 12 million now produces 35 per cent of Thailand's economic wealth. As a magnet for foreign companies, Bangkok attracts many overseas managers and business people from different fields, including tourism, automobiles and electronics. The city's population of foreigners is in the high hundreds of thousands, with tens of thousands of Japanese, Chinese and western employees working alongside hundreds of thousands of Burmese who mostly do unskilled jobs shunned by Thais. For those used to the good life, the variety and quality of the city's food is a key attraction, says one US manager, before listing many of his favourite Italian, Mexican and, of course, Thai restaurants. Most offer quality meals for less than the cost of a takeaway sandwich in London. Great choice and value can be found in Bangkok's other attractions, too. For overseas business people who enjoy shopping in luxury and air-conditioned comfort, the city has hundreds of modern shopping malls. Some foreigners, however, prefer the charms of Chatuchak Market, where anything can be bought at a good price by the skilled bargainer. When the time comes to talk business many overseas business people prefer to move out of the markets and onto the golf course. Thailand has thousands of courses, which can provide a welcome break from the busy and noisy city life. But most business people go to the golf course because it's the perfect place to discuss the next big deal. Because of the fast-paced life some foreign business people see Bangkok as a place to stay for the short term, rather than a lifetime.

Title: Mother and Son Movie plot: \\"Mother and Son\\" (1997) is a love story, not of the \\"Romeo and Juliette\\" or \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" type, but rather regarding the profound emotional ties that exist between a mother and her son. The film calls for amazing optical effects and sounds in order to develop a cinematographic poetry. \\"Mother and Son\\" is the first part of a trilogy that has for its subject matter the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by \\"Father and Son\\" (2003), and by \\"Two Brothers and a Sister,\\" the final installment, which is in its preliminary filming stage.The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail, old woman. They recline in a silence penetrated only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted, sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey, from her sick-bed to her death-bed. It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs.

Answer:","completion":"Bretton James, a major antagonist in the movie \\"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,\\" is exposed towards the latter part of the film. James, played by Josh Brolin, is the head of a rival investment bank called Churchill Schwartz and is the person responsible for the collapse of Keller Zabel Investments, leading to Louis Zabel's suicide. This tragic event prompts Jake Moore to seek revenge against Bretton James. Jake first encounters Bretton James when he attends a lecture by Gordon Gekko and later meets with Gekko to discuss the possibility of working together to expose James. Gekko agrees to help Jake in exchange for help in rebuilding his relationship with his estranged daughter, Winnie. As Jake becomes more entrenched in Bretton James' world, he gathers information on James' illegal activities and takes a job at Churchill Schwartz to dig deeper into their operations. Meanwhile, with Gekko's help, Jake and Winnie reveal that Bretton James is involved in a massive embezzlement scheme connected to the collapse of Keller Zabel. This exposé occurs during a charity event, where Gekko and Jake use a two-way disguised radio system to feed information about James's illicit activities to the influential people attending the event. Once the truth about Bretton James' unethical and illegal activities is out, a chain of events takes place leading to Bretton James' downfall, with regulatory authorities taking action against him and his company. He is forced to step down as the head of Churchill Schwartz as public opinion turns against him, and his Wall Street career is effectively ruined. Overall, Bretton James is exposed towards the end of the movie, when Jake Moore and Gordon Gekko work together to bring him down by revealing his corrupt practices and involvement in the collapse of Keller Zabel Investments. This ultimately leads to justice for Louis Zabel and his company, as well as the reclaiming of integrity in the world of finance."},{"prompt":"Q:- Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body.

The Nasdaq Composite rose 8.72 points, or 0.2%, to end at 5218.86. The S&P 500 gained 1.64 points, or 0.1%, to 2128.28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 13.96 points, or 0.1%, to 18100.41. Upbeat corporate earnings reports lifted stocks. Hasbro Inc. HAS -3.28 % notched the biggest gain in the S&P 500, rising 6.3%, after the toy maker reported better-than-expected profit and revenue in its second quarter. Halliburton Co. HAL 2.80 % ’s shares advanced 1.8% after the oil-services company posted per-share earnings and revenue that beat expectations. “Anything with growth is getting bought in a very, very aggressive manner,” said Rick Fier, director of execution services at Conifer Securities. He added that the “geopolitics has really calmed down,” referring to a recent bout of market volatility brought on by the financial crisis in Greece. Shares of Morgan Stanley MS 0.10 % fell 0.4% after the bank reported lower earnings that still topped analyst expectations. Monday’s gains mark a return for major indexes to record or near-record territory. Receding fears about Greece’s financial situation and some stronger-than-expected earnings reports have bolstered shares in recent sessions. For the month, the Dow has added 2.7% and the S&P 500 has gained 3.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has jumped 4.65% in July, helped by a rise in Google Inc. GOOG -0.11 % and Netflix Inc. NFLX 1.77 % following strong quarterly reports last week. Shares of both companies gave back some of their recent gains Monday. Google Class A shares lost 1%, while Netflix stock fell 3.7%. The second-quarter earnings season will continue to gain steam in coming days. Investors have been bracing for one of the weakest quarterly earnings seasons in years, with corporate performance hampered by a strong dollar and a selloff in oil prices. Including results from 67 companies in the S&P 500, second-quarter earnings are on track to slip 3.2% from a year ago. That is better than the 4.5% decline forecast by analysts heading into the reporting season. “Last week, we had a combination of bank earnings and a celebration that Greece was in the rearview mirror” driving stock gains, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. “This week, we get reports from a much broader swath of corporate America and that will give us a better handle on just how strong the second quarter was.” Elsewhere on Monday, a tumble in gold prices prompted a selloff in the shares of several mining firms. Shares of gold producer Newmont Mining Corp. tumbled 12%. The SPDR Metals & Mining ETF Index lost 2.4%. Materials firms in the S&P 500 lost 0.9%. Gold futures shed 2.2% to 1106.70 an ounce, their lowest level since March 2010. Crude-oil futures fell 1.5% to 50.15 a barrel. Shares of Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT -0.97 % rose 2% after the defense contractor agreed to buy Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp. UTX -7.03 % for 9 billion. United Technologies shares fell 0.2%. European stocks advanced as Greek banks reopened after three weeks, fueling confidence that Greece has avoided an exit from the eurozone. The Athens Stock Exchange, which has been closed since June 29, remained shut. Germany’s DAX rose 0.5% and France’s CAC-40 added 0.35%. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.372%, compared with 2.349% on Friday. Yields rise as prices fall. —Austen Hufford contributed to this article.

It weakens the insult, it lessens the tension in the situation, and it gets others on your side. Consider using humor the next time someone puts you down. You might find it appropriate to even exaggerate or extend the put down, which serves to further lessen the power of the insult. For example, if someone insulted you with the comment, “Your ears are so big,” you could offer a humorous response by saying, “Oh yes. The better to hear you with, my dear” (a reference to Little Miss Riding Hood). Laughing at an insult can be a very powerful response. Laughter makes the insult seem insignificant, and it also communicates that you were not hurt by the insult. Furthermore, it takes away the emotional power that the insulting person was hoping to gain from putting you down. Bullies are typically looking for a reaction or disagreement from you to fuel their desire to cause you pain. Instead of giving the bully what she is looking for, give her the unexpected by agreeing with whatever she said to insult you. Just say something like, “You are so right. I couldn’t agree more,” and keep agreeing as she continues the insult. She will get bored of teasing you of you don't provide a reaction. The person launching the insult is probably seeking for you to engage negatively. By walking away, you are essentially ignoring the person’s insult and the individual himself. Try to walk away the next time someone says something unkind. If you want, you can provide a brief comment as you walk away. For example, if your spouse were to say, “You are such a slob,” you response could be, “Okay,” and then walk away.

The team, headed by its creator, Dr. Jeremy Stone, investigates Piedmont. They retrieve the satellite and rescue a hysterical 60-year-old man and a colicky baby who have survived the Andromeda outbreak. In an isolated underground laboratory, the Wildfire team begins their examination of the downed satellite and the two survivors. The laboratory is powered by a small water-cooled nuclear reactor. In the event of a contamination breach, a 15-minute self-destruct sequence would be automatically initiated; however if the activated sequence is deemed unnecessary, Major Bill Keane, designated by the Odd-Man Hypothesis (which states that unmarried men are capable of carrying out the best, most dispassionate decisions during crisis), is the only person able to deactivate the sequence, using his pass key and right thumbprint.

Explain the relevance of Major Bill Keane and the Odd-Man Hypothesis in the context of the plot? Answer: Major Bill Keane, as per the Odd-Man Hypothesis (which intimates that unmarried men are capable of carrying out the best, most dispassionate decisions during a crisis), is the only person who can deactivate an automatically initiated self-destruct sequence in the event of a contamination breach in the laboratory. His role, therefore, is crucial in case of an emergency. 5. What is the significance of the \\"Wildfire\\" team and how do they contribute to the progress of the story? Answer: The \\"Wildfire\\" team, activated by General Mancheck, consists of five scientists led by Dr. Jeremy Stone. Their role is to investigate high-level bioterror threats. In the context of this movie, they explore the Andromeda outbreak, retrieve the satellite, and rescue the survivors. The analysis and actions of the Wildfire team drive the narrative of the story. 6. How does the satellite crash impact the town of Piedmont, Utah, and how does the government respond to the situation? Answer: The satellite crash near Piedmont, Utah, leads to the release of a deadly microorganism codenamed Andromeda when the town's inhabitants open it. As a result, a team from the Army's bio-defense department is dispatched to retrieve the satellite, but they succumb to the disease. Owing to the unusual deaths and footage recorded by the retrieval team, \\"Wildfire\\" - a team of five scientists for high-level bioterror threats - is activated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Dog Breed: The given information is that a pitbull is running outside. Pitbulls are a specific breed of dogs, whereas the premise talks about a black and white dog. There is no information regarding the color of the pitbull or whether it matches the description given in the premise. Therefore, we cannot confirm if the dog in question is a pitbull or not. 2. Color of the Dog: The premise specifies that the dog is black and white. The given information (a pitbull) does not say anything about the color of the dog. Pitbulls can come in various colors, but we don't have enough information in the statement to determine if the pitbull in question is indeed black and white. 3. Running through the Water: The premise mentions that the dog is running through the water, whereas the given information states that a pitbull is running outside. While it is possible that the pitbull could be running through the water while it is outside, we don't have enough information to confirm or deny this aspect. 4. Holding Something Red in its Mouth: The premise indicates that the dog is holding something red in its mouth, but the given information does not provide any details regarding the pitbull carrying something in its mouth or the object's color.

Everybody is looking for that edge that will make them faster, stronger, more physically fit. One approach taken by many athletes is the use of amino acid supplements. The theory is that the increase in amino acids in the diet will lead to increased protein for muscles. However, the only real benefit comes to the people who make and sell the pills. Studies have not showed any advantage obtained by the athletes themselves. You’re much better off just maintaining a healthy diet. Now, I have a new situation: A big marathon is being held in Chicago this year, Many people from the area are going to participate and there is a cash prize of 10000 for the winner. A sporting goods store that specializes in amino acid supplements begins advertising more heavily during the time coming up to the race. Answer this question please: Given most of the marathon participants are competitive athletes, will sales at the sporting goods store increase or decrease for amino acid supplements? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided background and situation, it is likely that sales of amino acid supplements at the sporting goods store will increase during the time leading up to the marathon. This increase can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the majority of the marathon participants are competitive athletes who are constantly seeking ways to improve their performance. The prevailing belief among many athletes and fitness enthusiasts is that amino acid supplements may provide an advantage in terms of enhancing endurance, muscle growth, and recovery. Although scientific studies have not consistently demonstrated a clear advantage of amino acid supplementation for athletes, consumer perceptions often drive purchasing behavior. Secondly, the increased advertising by the sporting goods store can also contribute to a boost in sales. Advertising is a powerful tool to persuade consumers and create awareness of a product. The store's heavy advertising campaign, targeting the growing excitement surrounding the marathon, is likely to attract the attention of potential participants and other fitness-minded consumers. Furthermore, the presence of a cash prize of 10,000 for the winner of the marathon can also act as an incentive for athletes and marathon enthusiasts to try every available strategy to increase their chances of winning, including the use of amino acid supplements. The allure of the prize money might push individuals to experiment with new products or strategies, even if scientific evidence regarding their efficacy is limited. Lastly, with the marathon being held in Chicago, a densely populated urban area, the sporting goods store is likely to have a larger potential customer base. The increased visibility of the marathon in the local community will create buzz around the event and related products, further boosting sales potential. In conclusion, given the competitive nature of the athletes participating in the marathon, the increased advertising efforts by the sporting goods store, and the overall excitement surrounding the event, it is reasonable to expect an increase in sales of amino acid supplements during the time leading up to the race. However, it is worth noting that individuals looking to improve their athletic performance should prioritize a healthy and balanced diet, as the actual benefits of amino acid supplementation for athletes are still inconclusive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - - The wife of an Indian government minister was found dead in a New Delhi hotel room on Friday, police said, days after she was involved in a row with a Pakistani woman journalist over Twitter. It was not immediately clear how Sunanda Puskhar Tharoor, wife of junior human resource development minister Shashi Tharoor, had died, Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said. \\"She was lying in bed.

Question 2: I travel a lot at work, so I tend to eat out a lot. What are suggestions for how I can control my calorie intake? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer 1: To determine how many calories you need to eat when you start road cycling, we'll need to consider a few additional factors, such as the distance and intensity of your cycling sessions, your weight, and your overall goals (such as weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain). Here's a step-by-step process to estimate your calorie needs: Step 1: Determine the calories burned during road cycling. On average, a person can burn approximately 400-600 calories per hour of road cycling, depending on intensity and weight. Step 2: Calculate your cycling sessions per week and estimate total calories burned. For example, if you cycle for one hour, three times a week, you might burn approximately 1200-1800 calories from cycling. Step 3: Combine your normal calorie intake (2000 calories) with the additional calories burned from road cycling. If you want to maintain your current weight, add these burned calories to your regular intake (e.g., 2000 + 1200 = 3200 calories per week). Step 4: Divide the total calories by seven to estimate your daily calorie needs. For our example, 3200 / 7 = approximately 457 calories per day more than your regular intake. This would bring your daily intake to around 2457 calories per day. Keep in mind that these numbers are approximate, and individual factors may vary. It's important to listen to your body and adjust your calorie intake accordingly. Answer 2: Controlling calorie intake while eating out can be challenging but manageable with some simple strategies: 1. Research the menu beforehand and make healthier choices. Many restaurants have their menus available online, allowing you to plan your meal ahead of time. 2. Watch portion sizes. Restaurant portions can be more significant than necessary. Consider asking for a half portion, sharing a meal with a colleague, or packing half of your meal to eat later. 3. Limit high-calorie beverages like sugary drinks and alcohol. Opt for water or low-calorie alternatives. 4. Choose dishes that are steamed, grilled, or baked, instead of fried, and ask for sauces and dressings on the side. 5. Opt for a salad, vegetables, or fruit as your side dish instead of fries or other high-calorie options. 6. Be mindful of overall caloric intake throughout the day. If you know you'll be eating out for dinner, try and have a lighter lunch or breakfast. The answers to these questions are not the same. The first answer provides a method for calculating your calories when you start road cycling. The second answer offers strategies for controlling calorie intake while eating out, which could help in maintaining a balanced diet regardless of your physical activity levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the meantime bank robbers hijack an armored car. When the police arrive to stop Shawn from jumping, the one of the bank robbers accidentally get caught (Thompson). The cops break up the robbery, but one of the robbers, Charlie Anders (played by Beesley), takes Shawn hostage by threatening to shoot her. They make a deal: she will help him escape if he promises to kill her afterwards. As poetic justice, the bank vice-president was a collaborator in the robbery but is arrested. The film begins at the moment when Shawn and Charlie jump into the water, then jumps back to 24 hours earlier. In the scenes when Charlie and Shawn are hiding out near his boat, you can see the clock moving backwards.

End Scene[edit] Shawn and Charlie are seen on a beach in South America. Living the dream that Charlie tells Shawn about previously during the boat scene. Answer:","completion":"After Shawn helps Charlie escape, she makes Charlie promise to kill her as part of their deal. This is because Shawn is feeling suicidal due to her situation – being in an affair with the married bank vice-president who eventually gets arrested for collaborating in the robbery. She initially plans to jump off the roof to end her life but ends up being taken hostage by Charlie during the robbery attempt. Throughout the movie, Shawn and Charlie form an emotional connection as they continue evading the police and working together for their mutual goals – Charlie's escape and Shawn's death.

They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn.

They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

Yes, the statement \\"Radio transcription producers such as World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers (AMP) were the dominant licensees of the Western Electric wide range system and towards the end of the 1930s were responsible for two-thirds of the total radio transcription business.\\" does contain the correct answer to \\"Who was responsible for 2/3 of all recordings in the 1930s?\\" The provided statement gives a clear indication of the companies that had a hold over two-thirds of the radio transcription business during that time period, specifically World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers. They were the dominant licensees of the Western Electric wide range system, which was a crucial technology during the 1930s for audio recording and distribution. This wide range system allowed for significantly improved audio fidelity, which helped these two companies to be dominant in the radio transcription market. World Broadcasting System was founded in 1929 by renowned radio broadcaster and engineer Edward J. Noble. The company aimed to produce high-quality pre-recorded radio programs to be distributed across various radio stations in the United States. They implemented the Western Electric wide range system to ensure high-quality recording and transmission of their programs, which in turn made them a dominant player in the radio transcription business. Associated Music Publishers (AMP) was another key player in this market space that focused specifically on the publishing and distribution of music-related content. Founded in 1919 by Max Dreyfus and his brothers, it was a thriving publishing company that catered to a wide range of genres, including classical, jazz, and popular music. Through their use of the Western Electric wide range system, AMP was able to make high-quality recordings and distribute them to radio stations, further solidifying their significant role in the market. Together, the World Broadcasting System and Associated Music Publishers captured two-thirds of the entire radio transcription business by the end of the 1930s, making them the primary entities responsible for the majority of recordings during that time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we're going to talk about a story that's happening in a big city called New York. New York is a place where lots of people live and work, and it has tall buildings and many exciting places to visit. Sometimes, when people grow up, they get important jobs where they have to make decisions to help keep the city safe and healthy. One of these jobs is called the \\"Health Chief.\\" The Health Chief is in charge of making sure everyone in the city can see a doctor if they are sick and that the air we breathe and the water we drink is clean. But do you know what? There is some news about the Health Chief in New York that not everyone is happy about. Some people are saying that the Health Chief did not do their job properly. They say the Health Chief used their power in a bad way. This is called \\"abusing power.\\" Abusing power is not a good thing because it can hurt other people, and it's not how we're supposed to do our jobs or treat each other. Now, the grown-ups in New York who are in charge of keeping the city running smoothly are looking into what the Health Chief did wrong. They want to make sure everybody has a chance to stay healthy and that nobody uses their power in a not-so-nice way again. So, what does this mean for our big city of New York? Well, when someone abuses their power, it means the grown-ups need to step in and figure out what went wrong. They will try to find a solution so that everyone can continue to work together and make sure the city is a safe and healthy place to live. In the end, it is important for everyone with important jobs to remember to always use their power for good and never for their own benefit. We all need to work together and make sure everyone is treated fairly and kindly.

It is important to be empathetic and understanding in such situations, and denying someone's experience could cause further harm.

Towson University’s champion cheerleaders have been suspended for hazing. The Baltimore school’s cheerleading squad has been suspended for a recent hazing incident that the school has not yet disclosed. An investigation into the matter has been completed, but an appeal is still on-going, Gay Pinder, media relations, told MailOnline. The university first learned of the allegations Aug. 6. A total of 10 incoming freshman co-eds were hazed, Ms Pinder told MailOnline, adding that they went unharmed. No title defense: Despite an automatic place in the next cheer championships, in 2014, it appears unlikely the team will defend its title. The team has been suspended for the entire 2013-2014 academic year, according to Ms. Pinder. First enacted while the university looked into the allegations, the punishment stood after the investigation was completed. The suspension was first reported by the university’s student newspaper The Torchlight. ‘Towson has a policy of no hazing and we do take that very seriously, said Ms. Pinder, ‘we have high expectations of our students and expect them to treat each other with the utmost respect.’ The school has not yet released the details surrounding exactly how the students were hazed, and Ms Pinder declined to provide those details to MailOnline. Champions: The squad won the most recent Division I cheer championships, earning an automatic bid in next year's tournament. Banned: Towson University's cheerleading team has been suspended following allegations of hazing. It is not clear if this is the first incident of hazing involving the cheer team, according to Ms Pinder.While sports teams have usually been in the hazing spotlight, pep squads have been outed as hazers as well. A drum major at Florida A&M University died after a 2011 hazing incident during which he was beaten by several members of the school band. ‘I have never heard of a whole team getting suspended,’ Jim Lord, executive director of the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators told the Baltimore Sun. ‘That is pretty rare, maybe unheard of,’ he added. In April, Towson’s cheerleaders placed first in the All-Girl Division I section of the National Cheerleaders Association's Collegiate Cheerleading Championship. Their win proffered them an automatic spot in the 2014 competition, one they look unlikely to attend.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock), a biomedical engineer from Lake Zurich, Illinois, is aboard the NASA space shuttle Explorer for her first space mission, STS-157. Veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) is commanding his final mission. During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of debris in space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the shuttle. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter. High-speed debris from the Russian satellite strikes the Explorer and Hubble, detaching Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), recovers Stone and they return to the Explorer. They discover that it has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew is dead. They decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450Â km (900Â mi) away. Kowalski estimates they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again. En route to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the substantially damaged but still operational ISS, they see that its crew has evacuated in one of its two Soyuz modules. The parachute of the remaining Soyuz has deployed, rendering the capsule useless for returning to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station Tiangong, 100Â km (60Â mi) away, in order to board a Chinese module to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering power, the two try to grab onto the ISS as they fly by. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite...

Came here to meet some work colleagues for lunch. First thing I noticed when I arrived, the have a very nice terrace (Patio in other provinces) to eat on outside. Entering inside you get a wafting smell of fresh popcorn. Not really the smell I cared for at lunch but oh well! Met up with my work colleagues and we sat in a big booth. The place is decorated in sports bar paraphenalia with TV's on in the background. I ordered the chicken quesidillas with a house salad. The chicken quesos came out as a generous serving with the shell crispy brown on the edges.

Two people went to the eye doctor's office for an annual exam; James had farsightedness, while Bob had perfect 20/20 vision. Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Article: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today. The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984.

In this statement, we learn that during the month of July, a company called CWT has managed to gain majority control over a joint venture they have in India. Let us break down the statement further to understand its implications and context. 1. In July: This sets the timeframe of the event, stating that it takes place in the month of July. It does not specify a year, so we can only assume that it refers to the most recent or upcoming July from the time the statement was made. 2. CWT: This refers to a company or organization by the acronym CWT. Without further context, we cannot be sure which company it refers to. However, some possibilities include Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a global business travel management company, or CWT Limited, a Singapore-based logistics and supply chain solutions provider. 3. Gains majority control: This implies that CWT has secured over 50% ownership or voting rights in the joint venture. Majority control would give CWT significant influence over the operations, strategy, and decision-making of the joint venture, effectively giving them control of its management and direction. 4. Of Indian joint venture: This provides information about the location and nature of the entity in question. The joint venture is based in India, which means that it operates within the Indian market, potentially leveraging local resources, knowledge, and connections. A joint venture is a type of business arrangement between two or more parties who pool their resources and expertise to achieve a specific goal or to enter a new market. This type of entity is usually created to share risks, costs, and benefits between the involved parties. Taking all of these aspects into consideration, the statement provides insight into a strategic move by CWT to solidify its position in the Indian market by acquiring majority control in a joint venture. This move likely signals the company's commitment to and confidence in the potential of this market. The joint venture could be in any industry related to CWT's core business, such as travel, logistics, or supply chain management. It would be relevant for those who follow CWT or have an interest in the industry or Indian market to keep an eye on further developments or announcements related to this joint venture. This move could lead to expanded operations, more significant market share, or the introduction of new products and services by the joint venture, ultimately impacting CWT's overall business growth and success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - movies - school - theatre - event - new york The rationale to choose \\"movies\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"movies.\\" The rationale for this choice revolves around the context provided in the question and general customs associated with each option. At intermission, people viewing a performance often take a break. Intermissions are common in theaters (for plays), concerts, and other live performances to provide the audience and performers a brief respite. However, the critical clue in this question is the mention of popcorn purchasing during intermission. Out of the options provided - movies, school, theatre, event, and New York - the practice of having an intermission for popcorn purchasing aligns best with movie-watching customs. In movie theaters, there is traditionally a snack counter where audiences can buy drinks, candy, and notably popcorn. Popcorn and movies have been mentally linked for many people given this long-standing custom, making it conventional for audiences to enjoy popcorn while watching a movie. Additionally, although it's uncommon, some extended movie screenings may have intermissions during which viewers can buy snacks and use the comfort room. On the other hand, the other choices in the list - school, theatre, event, and New York - either don't typically include popcorn as part of the experience or don't regularly include intermissions in the same way as movies. Schools typically do not have intermissions where students and teachers can buy popcorn—break times are used for other purposes like studying, eating lunch, or socializing. In theatre-setting, although there could be an intermission, popcorn is not usually part of the theatre etiquette—it is seen as distracting and could even detract from the immersive experience of the performance because of the noise it might create. In general events, the intermission structure and popcorn's place is highly variable and not consistent. As for \\"New York,\\" it's not an activity or event but rather a place, making it an unlikely answer to the question. While one could argue that there are movie theaters in New York, it isn't specific enough compared to the direct relevance of \\"movies.\\"\\"\\" So, given the popcorn purchase during an intermission, the most plausible scenario would indeed be, watching a movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to answer the question on who charged that Napoleon was untroubled by the prospect of war and death for thousands, we need to dive deeper into history and the people who were critical of Napoleon's actions during his reign. There were numerous contemporaries, politicians, and historians who had differing views on his leadership and actions. One such person is the British writer, Thomas Paine, who had accused Napoleon of having no regard for the lives of the people he ruled over. In April 1797, Paine wrote a letter to Napoleon, stating that \\"The history of the expedition, which you made to Italy under the command of General Bonaparte, is now no longer a secret... You have no respect for life, you have often, with all the coolness of calculation, risked the lives of two or three hundred men to avoid a trifling expense.” Paine's words reflect his concerns about Napoleon's willingness to casually risk lives for conquest and power. Another person who charged Napoleon with being untroubled by war and death was Madame de Staël, a prominent woman of letters during the Napoleonic era and widely known for her opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte. She consistently spoke critically of him and his reign, accusing him of causing much suffering and havoc in his quest for power. Furthermore, the French politician François-René, vicomte de Chateaubriand, also expressed concern over Napoleon's ambitions and disregard for human life. In his influential book \\"Mémoires d'Outre-Tombe,\\" Chateaubriand criticized Napoleon, stating, \\"He weighed everything in the balance of his ambition and his interests; the millions of men crushed beneath the wheel of his colossal car had no more influence on his soul than the dust raised by its passage.\\" In summary, while the statement on Napoleon's role in the Haitian Revolution and the decision to reinstate slavery correctly highlights some controversial aspects of his reign, it does not answer the question of who charged him with being untroubled by the prospect of war and death for thousands. Various figures, including Thomas Paine, Madame de Staël, and François-René de Chateaubriand, criticized and accused Napoleon of having little regard for human life in his pursuit of power and conquest."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this instance: Text: obligatory, not today but... about a year and a half ago... background: i have a congenital heart defect known as a \\"bicuspid aortic valve\\". it is not a huge deal, and not uncommon, but can become very serious, and has the potential to see you just drop dead if it is not monitored, especially for the unfortunates that are never diagnosed. basically, blood flows back in with every pump, and the valve can calcify over time and require replacement - the options for which are limited and not ideal. besides getting tired a little easier, and not being able to do things that rapidly raise blood pressure (like power lifting), it doesn't affect me much. however, in 2015, at one of my checkups, it was found that i had developed an aortic aneurysm. i was told that it still had a bit to grow until it became urgent, but also that there was a chance it could burst, and cause, well… you get the point, and this is where the fuckup truly starts. i had known that i had my condition since i was about twelve, but having it finally present a real and present problem brought it from the abstract to the all-too-real. being the totally not-anxious, happy-go-lucky guy who doesn't know the meaning of existential crisis that i am, i began panicking at every slight chest pain - which i have frequently due to an unrelated condition. *it’s fun, gives me energy, and is a great way to stay in shape.* a few months later i was driving back from a meeting in a town about 50 minutes away from home, and i began to feel chest pain along with some other disconcerting symptoms: numbness and lack of mobility in my extremities, face tightening, eyelids twitching. after nearly pulling over and calling an ambulance several times, i decided i was close enough to drive myself to the er, so i stopped briefly and used my defunct digits to mash out directions to the nearest hospital on google maps. about 20 minutes later, i had made it to the hospital, and walked in with what i am sure was a look of sheer terror on my face, as the security guard at the intake didn't bother to ask me to empty my pockets and whatnot. lpt: if you go into an er saying you have a heart condition, and are experiencing chest pain - to the front of the line you go. not sure if this works for other lines, but feel free to try. an older couple waiting (and apparently, not *dying*) were not pleased with my usurping their place in the queue, but we would meet again later. after the basic hospital intake stuff, and speaking with the doctor, most of my symptoms subsided and i began to feel embarrassed for freaking out. i apologized to the physician multiple times, and sheepishly told him i was just going to go home. after quite a bit of convincing – and worrying about the cost (because i live in the us, and it is generally cheaper to just go ahead and die) – he persuaded me to at least stay and get a ct-scan, just in case. as they moved me to radiology, in obvious “this guy might die” mode, we pass the old man half of the couple from earlier; his eyes apologized for him. the ct-scan was completed, and i was wheeled back to my room for about 3 minutes before the doctor came back in with a look on his face that you never want to see from an er doctor, police officer, emt, parent, friend, or anyone. ever. “your aneurysm has ruptured, and the cardiac surgeon is on his way, but i need you to stay calm to keep it from escalating” so, of course, insta-panic. after hyperventilating enough to bring back the numbness and twitching (which is what had caused those symptoms in the first place), i did eventually manage – with the help of a very kind nurse – to mellow out a bit and call my family. my brother and girlfriend were waiting at the bar for me, and she did not hear her phone, so i called my brother: “hey, man. when you comin’? thought you would have been here by now…” “i need you to call mom and dad right away. my aneurysm ruptured and they are rushing me into emergency surgery. i am at ___________ hospital.” “oh fuck. fuck. fuck. ok, ok man, i love you. hang on we’ll be right there.” “ok, thanks. i love you too, little buddy.” with a quickness that only comes from such a situation, my family showed up in what was both an impossibly short, and absolutely interminable amount of time. the medical team that had by now amassed around me (doctor, several nurses, anesthesiologist, and newly-arrived cardiac surgeon) explained to my family what was happening, and the cardiac surgeon sat down to ask me some questions and explain the procedure. first, he told me that they would try to save the valve as it was still working fine, but would likely have to go ahead and replace it, so i needed to decide if i wanted a tissue (porcine/cadaver), or artificial valve. the former only has about an 8-10 year lifespan before you need to be opened up again; the latter can last a lifetime, but requires blood thinners forever. like i said earlier, not ideal either way, but i was not willing to have to take blood thinners every day to not die at 29. seeing an opportunity to lighten the mood, and after a prompt from my father attempting to do the same, i requested a tiger valve if it wasn’t too much trouble. next, the surgeon briefly explained the procedure: “we are going to open up your chest, and fill your chest cavity with ice to stop your heart while a machine circulates your blood. after fixing the aneurysm, and possibly replacing the valve, we will *try* to revive you.” try!? why use that word? i mean, maybe some people get some comfort from having what happens next described… i. did. not. *i know what a lot of you are probably thinking here: “that doesn’t sound like they rushed at all if it was such an emergency”. the entire time from scan results, to going under, was no more than 25 minutes, and i was conscious, my heart rate was stable (but elevated), and my other vitals were good. i am sure they would have moved faster if i had started flopping like a fish and making that awful dying-guy snoring sound.* so, i begged them not to let me die on my birthday (forgot that lovely tidbit; it was my 29th birthday) as that would be “so fucked up” (because everything was just peachy otherwise), and told them “let’s get on with it then”. moments later i was under, and on my way to the or. many hours later, i can’t fully recall just how long, i was in a recovery room coming out of the anesthesia. this part was told to me by my family; i do not remember anything but snippets. i very politely asked for a glass of water, and then proceeded – one by one – to inform each member of my family and the medical staff present, that “my balls itch” – “my balls itch” – “my balls itch”. of course, i was groggily itching my balls as i made this important announcement. a few more hours pass, and i remember fully coming around. as you could imagine, the first thing i did was to look at my chest for the damage. only, there was none. i was shaved (which sucked for quite a while after as i am hairy like ape), but had no sign of having been operated on. my brother, half-asleep on a chair next to me, saw that i was awake, and i asked him what the fuck was going on. he said it would be better to just wait and let the doctors explain. he went and retrieved the surgeon, who explained that the initial ct-scan had given a false positive. they had me on the operating table, but part of the procedure is to stick an ultrasound device of some kind down the throat to better pinpoint the area of the aneurysm. when they did this, they could not find it, so they sent me back for a “gated” ct-scan, which apparently times the pictures with your heartbeat. why they did not do this in the first place is beyond me, and i didn’t think to ask at the time. my brother seemed upset that they had almost cut me open for no reason, but i told him it was fine, and that i was just glad to be alive and un-filleted. i was shown the original scan, and even to a lay person, it looked pretty fucking bad; i don’t blame the medical staff one bit for treating it the way they did. one thing i **do** blame them for is not telling me how badly it was going to hurt the first time i peed, due to the catheter that had been inserted (and removed while i was unconscious, thank god). after a day of observation, “recovery”, and one of the most guilt-free hearthstone binges i will ever be afforded, i was discharged with a blood pressure/heart rate monitor, some beta blockers (blood pressure meds), and mercifully – diazepam. it is over a year later, i have the aneurysm checked every 6-12 months, and its progress is slow enough to give me at least a few more years to pray that medical technology advances far enough to offer me less invasive surgery (this looks promising) and better valve replacement options (haven’t seen anything encouraging here). i still panic a little when i have chest pains, but i have gotten marginally better at managing my reactions – at least enough to have not been to the hospital again. edit: thank you all so much for the support and information, i am working on responding to all you wonderful internet strangers, and glad you enjoyed my story. in the mean time, have [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/h1hvh) .

I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Peace and nonviolence are not outdated concepts, but rather essential principles that remain relevant in today's world. Both peace and nonviolence promote harmony, mutual understanding, and cooperation, which are crucial for sustainable development and the well-being of all living beings on the planet. However, it is essential to recognize that finding solutions to conflicts may sometimes be difficult, and the concept of peace should be examined in both contemporary and historical contexts. There are several reasons why peace and nonviolence are not outdated. The most obvious is the continued existence of conflicts and wars, which threaten global stability and security. In fact, some argue that the world needs more commitment to nonviolence due to the presence of modern technological advancements, such as nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. These powerful and devastating weapons can lead to unimaginable consequences if conflict arises, emphasizing the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve disagreements. Furthermore, nonviolence is a practice well-grounded in various philosophies and religious traditions. For instance, Buddhism, Christianity, and Jainism all advocate for nonviolence and peace as part of ethical living, encouraging compassion and love towards others. Additionally, various historical figures, such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., demonstrated that nonviolent approaches could achieve significant political and social change. Peace and nonviolence also have practical benefits in modern times. They encourage the resolution of disputes in a way that avoids further escalation of violence, helps to prevent the unnecessary loss of life, fosters trust among nations, and builds bridges of understanding that could lead to long-lasting cooperation. Moreover, the investment in peace and nonviolent conflict resolution has positive economic consequences. When there is a decrease in spending on military expenses and war reconstruction, resources can be redirected towards improving social, educational, and healthcare infrastructure, benefiting societies as a whole. Should we always seek peace? While the idea of always seeking peace may seem utopian, it is essential to promote a culture of peace whenever possible. Such a culture encourages open dialogue, cooperation, and understanding, and works towards resolving conflicts through nonviolent means. This can include negotiation, mediation, and diplomacy. However, it is important to recognize that some situations may necessitate the use of force, such as in cases of self-defense or to prevent mass atrocities. In these instances, exhausting all peaceful options should be a prerequisite before resorting to forceful means. Now, let us examine if the questions \\"Are peace and nonviolence outdated concepts?\\" and \\"Should we always seek peace?\\" are the same. While these questions deal with similar concepts, they are not the same. The first question aims to determine whether peace and nonviolence are still relevant in modern times, whereas the second question asks if seeking peace should always be our primary goal. The first question is concerned with the overall relevance of these principles, while the second question deals with whether peaceful solutions should be prioritized in all situations. In summary, while both questions are related to peace and nonviolence, they address distinct aspects of these ideas, making them different from one another."},{"prompt":"Q: Fact 1: Adrought can change the color of an environment from green to brown.

And I was wondering What did Kendall do? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it seems that Kendall was quite determined to ensure Tracy would agree to go see Lady Gaga with her. Given that she wouldn't take no for an answer, we can imagine several actions and strategies Kendall might have employed to persuade Tracy. Here are some possible scenarios detailing what Kendall could have done: 1. Encouraging Tracy with enthusiasm: Kendall might have shared her excitement and enthusiasm for the concert, detailing how fantastic Lady Gaga is as a live performer and how much fun they would have together at the event. By sharing her positive experiences and highlighting the unique aspects of the concert, Kendall could have enticed Tracy to agree to go with her. 2. Offering additional incentives: To sweeten the deal, Kendall could have offered to cover some of Tracy's expenses for the event, such as her ticket or transportation costs. Similarly, she could have suggested making a full day or weekend out of the event by adding fun activities or meals before or after the concert to create even more appeal for attending. 3. Addressing Tracy's concerns: Kendall might also have taken the time to listen to any reservations or concerns Tracy may have had about attending the concert. By being empathetic and understanding, she could have worked to alleviate those concerns, whether it was finding solutions to logistical issues, such as arranging transportation or accommodations, or addressing any anxiety Tracy might have about large crowds or unfamiliar venues. 4. Highlighting the rare opportunity: Another potential approach Kendall could have taken was to emphasize the rarity of such an event. Lady Gaga concerts might not happen frequently, particularly in the specific area where they live, and attending a live performance could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. By pointing this out, Kendall might have been able to convince Tracy that experiencing the concert together would be a special and memorable occasion. 5. Involving mutual friends: To create more appeal for the event, Kendall may have invited other mutual friends to join them in attending the concert. By making it a group outing, Tracy might have felt more comfortable and excited about the idea, knowing they would be with familiar people and in a fun, social setting. 6. Persistent persuasion: Lastly, it's possible that Kendall used a combination of these methods or simply continued to bring up the concert over time in different conversations. By doing this, she could have engaged Tracy's interest, worn down any resistance, and ultimately gotten her to agree. In conclusion, while we can only speculate about the specific details, it's evident that Kendall was committed to persuading Tracy to attend the Lady Gaga concert with her.

The board broke in half when shot by the arrow because the","completion":"force exerted by the arrow upon impact was greater than the structural integrity of the board, causing it to fracture and ultimately break apart. The factors that contributed to the board's breaking can be examined from various perspectives, such as the materials used, the design of the arrow, and the kinetic energy involved in the process. First, let's focus on the board's material properties. The board would have been made from a specific type of material, such as wood, plastic, or composite. Each of these materials has a different strength, stiffness, and density, which will all affect how it responds to an external force. For example, wood is a natural material that has a relatively low density compared to plastics and composites, but it is also quite strong and durable. However, if a board made of wood contains knots, imperfections, or areas of low-quality grain orientation, its overall structural strength will be reduced, making it more susceptible to breaking when subjected to a force such as that imparted by the arrow. Secondly, the design of the arrow plays a crucial role in determining the force it can exert upon impact. Arrows can be made of various materials such as wood, aluminum, carbon fiber, or a combination of different materials. The weight, stiffness, and aerodynamics of the arrow will all affect its performance in flight and during impact. If the arrow used in the present case shot with sufficient velocity and precision, it could generate enough concentrated force at the point of impact to ultimately break the board in half. This is especially true if the arrow was equipped with a broadhead, which is designed to create more significant damage upon impact, rather than a traditional field point that would typically be used for target practice. Now let's delve into the kinetic energy and the physics involved in the process. The kinetic energy of an object in motion (such as the arrow in flight) can be defined by the equation KE = 0.5mv^2, where KE represents the kinetic energy, m is the object's mass, and v is the object's velocity. The higher an object's mass and velocity, the greater its kinetic energy will be. When the arrow makes contact with the board, this kinetic energy is transferred to the board. As a result, the board experiences a force that acts on a very localized area (assuming the arrowhead to be relatively small), which may exceed the stress-bearing capacity of that area. From the physics standpoint, the force applied to the board can be described by the equation F = ma, where F is the force, m is the object's mass, and a is the object's acceleration. As the arrow's mass and acceleration increase, the force exerted on the board also increases. Finally, it is essential to consider the cumulative effect of all these factors. The board's material properties and any inherent weaknesses, the design and characteristics of the arrow, and the kinetic energy generated during the arrow's flight all contribute to the force experienced by the board when struck. If this force is greater than the board's ability to withstand such stress, the board will ultimately break apart, as evidenced by the given scenario. In conclusion, the board broke in half when shot by the arrow due to a combination of factors that led to an overwhelming force being exerted on the board, surpassing its structural integrity and causing it to fracture. By examining the materials, the arrow's design, and the physics involved, it becomes clear that multiple elements contributed to this outcome. Therefore, improving any one of these aspects may help prevent similar incidents in the future, either by increasing the structural strength of the board or by reducing the force with which the arrow impacts it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Other U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing investigation, identified the hackers as being state-sponsored. One private security firm, iSight Partners, says it has linked the OPM intrusion to the same cyber­espionage group that hacked the health insurance giant Anthem. The FBI suspects that that intrusion, announced in February, was also the work of Chinese hackers, people close to the investigation have said. The intruders in the OPM case gained access to information that included employees’ Social Security numbers, job assignments, performance ratings and training information, agency officials said. OPM officials declined to comment on whether payroll data was exposed other than to say that no direct- deposit information was compromised. They could not say for certain what data was taken, only what the hackers gained access to. [China calls the accusation ‘irresponsible and unscientific’] “Certainly, OPM is a high-value target,” Donna Seymour, the agency’s chief information officer, said in an interview. “We have a lot of information about people, and that is something that our adversaries want.” The personal information exposed could be useful in crafting “spear-phishing” e-mails, which are designed to fool recipients into opening a link or an attachment so that the hacker can gain access to computer systems. Using the stolen OPM data, for instance, a hacker might send a fake e-mail purporting to be from a colleague at work. After the earlier breach discovered in March 2014, the OPM undertook “an aggressive effort to update our cybersecurity posture, adding numerous tools and capabilities to our networks,” Seymour said. “As a result of adding these tools, we were able to detect this intrusion into our networks.” “Protecting our federal employee data from malicious cyber incidents is of the highest priority at OPM,” Director Katherine Archuleta said in a statement. Katherine Archuleta, shown in November in Arlington, is director of the Office of Personnel Management. (Win Mcnamee/Getty Images) In the current incident, the hackers targeted an OPM data center housed at the Interior Department. The database did not contain information on background investigations or employees applying for security clear­ances, officials said. By contrast, in March 2014, OPM officials discovered that hackers had breached an OPM system that manages sensitive data on federal employees applying for clearances. That often includes financial data, information about family and other sensitive details. That breach, too, was attributed to China, other officials said. OPM officials declined to comment on whether the data affected in this incident was encrypted or had sensitive details masked. They said it appeared that the intruders are no longer in the system. “There is no current activity,” an official said. But Chinese hackers frequently try repeat intrusions. [The real story of how the Internet became so vulnerable] Seymour said the agency is working to better protect the data stored in its servers throughout the government, including by using data masking or redaction. “We’ve purchased tools to be able to implement that capability for all” the data, she said. Among the steps taken to protect the network, the OPM restricted remote access to the network by system administrators, officials said. When the OPM discovered the breach, it notified the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. A senior DHS official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, said the “good news” is that the OPM discovered the breach using the new tools. “These things are going to keep happening, and we’re going to see more and more because our detection techniques are improving,” the official said. FBI spokesman Josh Campbell said his agency is working with DHS and OPM officials to investigate the incident. “We take all potential threats to public- and private-sector systems seriously and will continue to investigate and hold accountable those who pose a threat in cyberspace,” he said. The intruders used a “zero-day” — a previously unknown cyber-tool — to take advantage of a vulnerability that allowed the intruders to gain access into the system. [Why the Internet’s massive flaws may never get fixed] China is one of the most aggressive nations targeting U.S. and other Western states’ networks. In May 2014, the United States announced the indictments of five Chinese military officials for economic cyber­espionage — hacking into the computers of major steel and other companies and stealing plans, sensitive negotiating details and other information. “China is everywhere,” said Austin Berglas, head of cyber investigations at K2 Intelligence and a former top cyber official at the FBI’s New York field office. “They’re looking to gain social and economic and political advantage over the United States in any way they can. The easiest way to do that is through theft of intellectual property and theft of sensitive information.” Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the past few months have seen a massive series of data breaches affecting millions of Americans. “This latest intrusion . . . is among the most shocking because Americans may expect that federal computer networks are maintained with state-of-the-art defenses,” he said. “The cyberthreat from hackers, criminals, terrorists and state actors is one of the greatest challenges we face on a daily basis, and it’s clear that a substantial improvement in our cyber databases and defenses is perilously overdue.” Colleen M. Kelley, president of the nation’s ­second-largest federal worker union, the National Treasury Employees Union, said her organization “is very concerned” about the breach. “Data security, particularly in an era of rising incidence of identity theft, is a critically important matter,” she said. “It is vital to know as soon as possible the extent to which, if any, personal information may have been obtained so that affected employees can be notified promptly and encouraged to take all possible steps to protect themselves from financial or other risks,” she said.

The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species. These people say the real culprit behind many of the reported incidents—including the famous 1916 shark attacks in New Jersey that may have served as inspiration for Jaws—may be the lesser known bull shark.\\"Biologists George A. Llano and Richard Ellis suggest that a bull shark could have been responsible for the fatal Jersey Shore attacks. Bull sharks swim from the ocean into freshwater rivers and streams and have attacked people around the world. In his book Sharks: Attacks on Man (1975), Llano writes, One of the most surprising aspects of the Matawan Creek attacks was the distance from the open sea. Elsewhere in the book are accounts of well-documented shark-human interactions at Ahwaz, Iran, which is 90 miles (140 km) upriver from the sea.

Available options: I. The Center Kingdom II. not enough information III. Silver's Drey IV. The mountains Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Miliband's war on hedge funds could damage City of London “This is potentially much worse than we initially thought. It's effectively FTT by another name,” said one source, who asked not to be named. The Treasury, led by Chancellor George Osborne, has continued to resist the European Union’s attempts to impose the FTT in the UK, for fear of the negative impact it could have on the City of London. It remains unclear how Mr Miliband might restrict the end of the relief solely to hedge funds, given intermediary tax relief benefits a variety of investors. Russell Morgan, EY tax partner, said: \\"While the detail of the proposals isn't clear yet it's going to be hard to design a a new rule that could target only the hedge fund industry and not individual investors and others who choose to invest in UK shares through derivatives for a wide variety of reasons.\\" Jack Inglis, chief executive of AIMA, the hedge fund lobby group, added: “It is misleading to describe this as a measure targeted specifically at hedge funds. This is a well-known investment strategy that is utilised by all levels of market participants including pension funds, insurance companies, traditional asset managers and individual investors.\\" “Labour hit pension funds back in 1997, and spent the last 13 years trying to recover its reputation,” said another source. “I’m surprised they seem to want to do this again.” In all, Labour plans to raise a total of £1.1bn from clamping down on tax avoidance, with the remaining £500m coming from closing the ‘Eurobonds’ loophole which allows large companies to move profits out of the UK – a loophole HM Revenue and Customs ruled against closing two years – and clamping down on so-called ‘umbrella companies.’ The remaining £1.4bn will come from the mansion tax and the tax on tobacco companies. Business big and small moved to rebuff Mr Miliband’s plans, with John Cridland, director general of the CBI questioning the Labour leader’s apparent lack of economic vision. “We heard very little about how to create the economic growth to deliver these ambitions and the crucial role of healthy and thriving businesses in creating prosperity for all.\\" John Longworth, head of the British Chambers of Commerce, concurred, saying “some elements of his speech are likely to be seen as short-term political expediency, and could create uncertainty for business which runs counter to the need for long-term strategic vision and investment.” Those likely to be the losers from Mr Miliband’s policies – which include a further hit on the profits of Britain’s banks – were also less than impressed. Rob Perrins, managing director of house builder Berkeley Group, branded the mansion tax as “misconceived.” \\"The way to grow our economy is to make it competitive and open. Don’t turn property into a liability and penalise the many Londoners who are asset rich but cash poor,” he warned. The tobacco lobby was also not amused, with the Tobacco Manufacturers Association branding the profits tax as “illogical.” Shares in Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco closed down 2.4pc and 2.05pc respectively.","completion":"Ed Miliband's proposed clampdown on tax avoidance from hedge funds could impact the City of London, according to insiders, implying that it may be worse than having the EU's Financial Transaction Tax (FTT). Despite the Treasury resisting the FTT for its possible negative effect on London, doubts remain on the specifics of Miliband's restrictions and how they could be applied solely to hedge funds without affecting other investors. The Labour Party intends to raise £1.1bn by eliminating tax avoidance, targeting the 'Eurobonds' loophole and so-called 'umbrella companies', as well.

Even if you joke about it, it makes you appear that you are desperate for any date. This might not only make you look desperate but also make you look like you do not respect your friends who are in relationships. Can we draw the following conclusion? joking about being single is always unbecoming Available options: (1). Yes. (2). It's impossible to say. (3). No.","completion":"(2). It's impossible to say. Joking about being single is not always unbecoming, as it heavily depends on the context, audience, and how the joke is delivered. However, it is essential to be careful when joking about your single status to avoid coming across as desperate or disrespectful to others. There are several ways to avoid looking desperate when discussing your relationship status, and taking a mindful approach to humor can help ensure that you are not perceived negatively. Here are some additional tips to keep in mind: 1. Be self-aware: Before making a joke or comment about your single status, consider how it might be perceived by others. If you feel that it may come across as desperate or disrespectful, find a different way to express your sentiment. 2. Gauge your audience: Understanding your audience is key when making jokes about personal matters. What may be viewed as light-hearted and humorous among close friends might not be as well-received in a more formal setting or with people you do not know well. 3. Avoid overdoing it: While using humor to cope with one's single status is completely normal, try to avoid making jokes about it all the time. This can make it seem like you are constantly seeking validation from others or that you are unhappy with your current relationship status. 4. Find a balance: It's important to strike a balance between joking about your single status and discussing other aspects of your life. People appreciate well-rounded conversations, and it can provide a more substantial connection with others when you discuss a range of topics. 5. Be confident: Confidence is key when it comes to avoiding looking desperate. Embrace your single status and focus on the positives, such as the opportunity to focus on personal growth, hobbies, and self-care. When you radiate confidence, others will be less likely to perceive you as desperate, even when discussing your single status. In conclusion, joking about being single is not always unbecoming, but it's essential to be mindful of the context and how it might be perceived. By following these tips and being self-aware, you can avoid looking desperate while still enjoying light-hearted humor about your relationship status."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It started out good...the opener is a showstopper, but then didn't really get better. This is a bit of a different-type of Cirque. It's got Cirquelike elements, and there are some seriously spectacular numbers, like their opening and last 2 closing numbers, and a few in the middle like Here Comes the Sun and then the fun Baby You Can Drive my Car...but other than that, they could have made it so much better than it is. There are SO many Beatles songs to choose from... even I know that, and I am not even a real Beatles fan...and they chose some random slow ones that just did not work with the dance and character numbers they paired them with. And the slow contemporary, reflective dance numbers in gauzy white linen?? Hello, I can see that on So You Think You Can Dance for free. Give me WAY more fun, jazzy, crazy Idontknowwheretolookrightnow numbers that are going to keep me from zzzz'ing during a 10pm show.

Both questions are inquiring about the value and worth of the Apple MacBook Pro released in late 2016, specifically regarding whether the investment in the product is justified. However, there are subtle differences in the way the questions are framed. The first question, \\"What do you think of the new MacBook Pro that was released in late 2016? Is it worth buying?\\" seeks an opinion about the MacBook Pro released in late 2016 and whether it is a worthwhile purchase. It focuses on the product's features, overall performance, and how it compares to other potential alternatives. It asks for a subjective judgment about the product's value. On the other hand, the second question, \\"Are the new Apple Macbook pros really worth their price?\\" focuses more on the cost-benefit analysis, questioning whether the price of the MacBook Pro is justified considering its features, performance, and design. While still asking for a subjective opinion, this question is more concentrated on the economic aspect and if the buyer would get good value for their money.

While people may have something to say, writing it down isn't the only way to communicate their thoughts. 2. \\"Express yourself\\" - This option is partly valid, as people do write things down to express themselves. However, this option doesn't capture the primary reason for writing, which is to preserve thoughts or information. 3. \\"Not to forget\\" - This option is the most appropriate answer. When people write things down, they often do so to ensure they don't forget important information or ideas. Writing serves as a tangible record that can be referred back to when needed, helping people remember better. 4. \\"Speak loudly\\" - This option is irrelevant, as speaking loudly is not related to writing things down. Moreover, speaking loudly doesn't help in preserving information or ideas in the same way writing does. 5. \\"Move fingers\\" - This option is also irrelevant and doesn't address the reasons people write things down. Moving fingers is simply a physical action involved in writing, not a reason to write. In conclusion, the answer is \\"not to forget\\" because writing things down primarily helps people preserve information or ideas for future reference and ensures they don't forget important details."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: how old is sybil vane in the picture of dorian gray A:","completion":"The question being asked is how old Sybil Vane is in the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, not whether Dorian Gray meets Lord Henry Wotton. Consequently, the 'yes or no' input provided will not suffice as an appropriate response to the given inquiry. Instead, to answer the underlying question, we can consult the book and determine Sybil Vane's age. In the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde, Sybil Vane is introduced as a young actress who takes on a significant role in Dorian Gray's life. Although her exact age is not explicitly stated, it is implied that she is relatively young, likely in her late teens or early twenties. This can be deduced because she is often described as innocent, youthful, and pure. For instance, in Chapter 5, Dorian describes her as being \\"hardly seventeen years of age, with a little flower-like face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose.\\" Notably, as the novel takes place during the Victorian era, young women were generally considered marriageable and capable of having their own careers from their late teens onwards.

But Michal Kapral, a 44-year-old editor from Toronto, had a more difficult goal in mind. He wanted to run a marathon ... while juggling ... without dropping a ball even once. And he did it at the Chicago Marathon on Sunday, at the brisk clip of 2 hours and 55 minutes. That's a pace of about 6:40 per mile. Kapral tells The Two-Way that he's an old hand at \\"joggling\\" (juggling while jogging, naturally). In fact, this is his eighth joggling marathon. He holds the world record for the \\"fastest marathon while joggling three objects,\\" which he has set multiple times, most recently in 2007 in Toronto. He ran that marathon 5 minutes faster, he says, but dropped the ball twice. This is the first time that he's managed to complete the race without a single drop. He says the pressure was building as he neared the end of the race: \\"I've never felt so much stress in my life.\\" During the last 400 meters, he says he \\"literally looked at every toss.\\" VIDEO by @wendyalas: Running the #ChicagoMarathon while juggling in 2:55 without a drop. Here are 10 catches out of 50,000+ #joggling pic.twitter.com/9W6ypaXouv — Michal Kapral (@mkapral) October 11, 2016 Kapral started joggling when he was 11, after flipping through the Guinness Book of World Records for records he might be able to break. He had just learned to juggle, he says, and was a part of his school's cross country team. About 20 years later, after completing a number of marathons, he thought he'd try joggling one of the races while raising money for charity. \\"When I first started I just assumed people would just make fun of me, and I started off training running in the dark before dawn while I figured out what I was doing,\\" he says. But now he's far bolder, and routinely joggles on his commute home or through downtown Toronto. \\"I think the most common reaction is people stop and just stare. They just stop in their tracks and then their jaw kind of drops, and they get the look of like, 'What did I just see?' \\" Kapral says. \\"It cracks me up.\\" There's a worldwide community of jogglers, including dozens who contacted him when he first set the world record for marathon joggling in 2005. \\"Ever since then, I hear from someone maybe every two weeks who's in some part of the world who does this,\\" he adds. Kapral manages to make juggling while running sound like a very natural motion: \\"Every step you take, every stride forward, as your arm swings you toss the ball up to the other side so the juggling cascade pattern matches perfectly with the running stride.\\" That grows more challenging over the course of 26.2 miles. He explains: \\"So the beginning, the first few miles, it's kind of relaxing, it's this meditative, kind of zen feeling, with this pattern floating around in front of your face. And it helps keep the rhythm, the juggling. And then after a while, your arms start to tire, and everything gets tired, and then it's just absolute agony the last few miles. It takes this incredible amount of focus. Suddenly you have to focus on every toss.\\" After experimenting with plastic balls, he says he prefers juggling with handmade beanbags, filled with millet. Kapral says he wants to try doing a steeplechase while juggling — that's a challenging long-distance race involving multiple barriers and water jumps. Feeling klutzy by comparison? This tweet might provide some solace: ||||| My hand injury turned out to be a muscle tear. ⚡️ “Toronto man tries to run entire marathon juggling 5 balls” https://t.co/2JQ4QHRLaH October 26, 2017 I'm just going to throw this out there: Sometimes when you set ridiculously challenging goals for yourself, you will fail. That's exactly what happened to me at the Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon last Sunday. My goal was to set a new Guinness World Record for the fastest marathon while joggling five objects.There was no current record, but the Guinness records-keepers decided through some calculus that 4 hours 40 minutes was the time to beat. This doesn't sound very quick, but here's the thing: running while simultaneously juggling five balls is exceedingly difficult. To a non-joggler, I might put it like this: joggling a marathon with three balls is like running a regular marathon, while joggling a marathon with five balls is like running a marathon hopping on your left foot only for the entire 42.2km. It's exponentially harder the further the distance.Leading up the race, my training had gone quite well. I practiced running 100m, 200m intervals joggling five balls, and worked my way up to being able to do some 400m joggles around the U of T Varsity track without dropping. But my average drop rate was still around every 100m, which is 422 drops for the marathon. I still thought it might be manageable, but knew based on timing my 100m joggles that a 4:40 marathon would be almost impossible.Lucky for me, I had a chance do some training with five-ball joggling record-holder Matt Feldman, who is incredibly quick at the 400m, mile and 5K.I also had lunch with five-ball joggling legend Barry Goldmeier, who regularly runs large portions of marathons while juggling five beanbags.The week before the race, CTV News and CP24 ran stories about the record attempt.I still can't stop laughing at the fact that I secured a sponsorship from the best cinnamon bun shop in Toronto. Thank you, Rosen's Cinnamon Buns for supporting my joggling dreams. A huge thank-you as well to Cheryl Sayers from Sport Juggling Company for the amazing Sportball beanbags.Zach arrived from D.C. on Friday and we toured Toronto riding BikeShare bikes on Saturday, which was probably not the best thing to do the day before trying to set a world record. I hadn't seen Zach in 10 years, when we raced each other at the 2007 Salt Lake City Marathon. I discovered that he's still one of the greatest people you could ever meet.Zach has worked as a circus performer, and is an expert juggler. The night before the marathon, we went out to practice some joggling to see how close he should follow during the race. Zach tried five-ball joggling and actually had some trouble with it. I realized that all my training had actually worked. I had developed a new skill (perhaps not the most useful skill in the world, but still...).Race day. My nerves were joggling big-time, since I still didn't know if this record was even possible. It was very difficult to tell during my training how the race would play out, since I trained on a track, or on an empty stretch of road in my neighbourhood. Zach and I lined up in the slowest corral for marathon finish times of 4:30 and slower. I decided to start near the front of this group, thinking if I got a good clean start, I could stay up front in the clear and avoid the crowds. But just before the horn sounded for our corral's start, a bunch of runners shimmied in front of me and Zach, and I suddenly found myself squished in a large crowd.I was immediately in a panic, trying to maintain the high tosses of the five-ball juggling pattern. I dropped several times right near the beginning, and scrambled to regroup right away so I didn't interfere with the runners behind me. This caused me to drop even more. I was exhausted almost right from the gun, and it just got worse from there. On the bright side, the spectators were loving it, and Zach shouted encouraging words to pull me out of my panicked state. It was still crowded up until about 3km, but by the time I had slowed enough to have some space to juggle, my energy was sapped. I felt like I had already run a marathon. I should've started at the very back and not worried about trying to run 4:40, but it was too late.In my frenzy, I somehow managed to injure my left hand, which began to hurt more and more with each toss. I hit 5K in 46 minutes, already 13 minutes behind schedule. Zach told me, based on my stride length and toss rate, that I would be making 130,000 tosses and catches for the marathon. It's going to be a long day, I thought. The next 5K took me 56 minutes. My hand was now in serious trouble, shooting pain up my forearm with each toss and catch. By the 13K turnaround on Lake Shore, I had entered survival mode. \\"We're going to finish this,\\" Zach said. \\"My flight doesn't leave until tomorrow.\\"Close to my break point at about 15K, the race film crew showed up. Wonderful, I thought. Everyone can watch me fall apart. And they did. As I inched forward a few steps at a time, the camera crew remained. I thought about all the people who had donated to SickKids Foundation, I thought about the sick kids, and I thought about how lucky I was to be out there doing this.The commentary on the race video is priceless. Canadian Running editor-in-chief Michael Doyle says it looks like a slow form of torture, and he was right!Things were not going well at all.I thought I could justmyself through the rest of the race, even if it took 15 or 20 hours. But just before the 17K marker, I knew my hand was too damaged to go on. I got the five-ball pattern going, joggled to the 17K sign, caught the balls, turned to Zach behind me, and declared, \\"Joggler out.\\" At this point, we were in last place in the entire race of 18,000 people, followed by a line of police cars.Zach said we should continue to run the rest of the marathon without juggling, and I agreed, though I secretly planned to bail at the half. A couple of kilometres later, we ran past three mounted police officers. Zach ran over to them and, employing his deft social skills from a decade of living and working in Afghanistan, he convinced them to gallop behind me on a final joggle. It was quite the scene. I ended up joggling at a good clip, as the clack of the hooves sounded altogether too close behind me.We continued on. Near the halfway point, we ran into my parents, my sister, Moira, and my niece, Kate. My mom reminded us that the course had a time limit of 6 hours. \\"A sub-2 half? We can do that!\\" Zach said, cheerfully. I put on my best smiley face, and off we went for another half marathon. We shared some good laughs with the walkers, and were ever grateful for the volunteers who remained at the scene to offer Gatorade and water to last runners and walkers. My entire body felt like it was falling apart, but somehow I found the strength to keep running. Zach hadn't run a marathon since our 2007 joggling duel in Salt Lake, and recently had back surgery, so he wasn't doing so well himself. But we chatted and laughed and joked our way through the rest of it.I juggled for the last few metres across the finish line. Two of my beanbags hit the timing clock above the finish and thumped to the ground on the finish line. Seemed appropriate that these extra two balls fell at the end.Joggling five balls every step of the way over long distances is very hard. Ludicrous, really. I knew this challenge had a good chance of failure. But I emerged from the experience with an odd sense of excitement. I tried. I gave it everything. I juggled to the last catch possible.I had the privilege of running with Zach Warren for 5 hours and 40 minutes, a great way to catch up with a friend after 10 years. I got to see my wife Dianne and kids, Annika and Lauryn at the end. Lots of people donated to SickKids, raising nearly 2,000. Zach and I posted a negative split of, possibly the largest negative split ever in a marathon. I joggled five balls of the race for 17K, which is likely the furthest anyone has gone for every step, returning behind the drop point after each drop. Zach and I had a chance to experience what it's like to be in last place in an IAAF Gold Label marathon. We met so many amazing people along the route. I got to joggle with a mounted police escort.There was some pretty entertaining media coverage after the race, from Canadian Running Sky Sports , and the Toronto Star . The Twitter Moment for it was even shared around the world by Twitter Moments and Twitter Sports.As joggler Bob Evans said to me on Facebook after the race, \\"There is no story without conflict. Your 5-ball marathon quest just got a lot more compelling. Keep going!\\" In this case, I battled the record, and the record won. This was captured perfectly in this screenshot of race video of me looking like a dejected gorilla.Joggler out, but not down. ||||| I'm Michal \\"The Joggler\\" Kapral of Toronto, Canada, and I run marathons while \\"joggling,\\" which is an actual sport that combines jogging and juggling.

Movie title: Ben and Me Movie plot: The film begins with a tour group in the present day, but quickly moves to the 16th century. Quickly tracing a mouse family's history in England, we see how the family was forced to go to America due to an excess of cats.In America, the film then focuses on Amos, a 1740s mouse living in a Philadelphia church. His attempts to land a job lead him to Benjamin Franklin's printing shop. He helps Franklin erase his debts, create a successful newspaper, invent new devices, and even helps make him more popular and respected with the people of the city.After Franklin involves Amos, without his permission, in the famous kite electricity experiment that nearly kills him, Amos is outraged and leaves him. Franklin's attempts to work alone prove disastrous such as a failed diplomatic mission to the King that pushes the colonies to open armed revolt.They finally reconcile in 1776 when Franklin begs Amos to return and agrees to sign a contract drafted by the mouse for more considerate treatment. Furthermore, as Franklin examines the agreement, Thomas Jefferson arrives to ask for help for the beginning of the Declaration of Independence he is writing. Amos insists that Franklin read his own agreement out loud at that moment and its wording inspires Jefferson to create an appropriate opening to his own piece.The movie ends with a return to the tour group in the present.

The NCAA voted Thursday to allow 65 teams from the so-called Big 5 power conferences—the ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Pac 12, and SEC, plus Notre Dame, a football independent that is now a member of the ACC in other sports—to make their own rules. These conferences will to offer their athletes not only a scholarship, but the full cost of attendance: money for extras like food, clothing, the occasional trip to the movie theater and more. Depending on the school, this could amount to athletes receiving an additional 2,000 to 5,000. With further autonomy, these schools will also ease restrictions on contact between athletes and agents, and be able to do things like pay for post-season travel for the families of athletes and invest more money in athletic health care coverage. The move in many ways reflects an economic reality. These conferences drive the most interest in college sports: Between 2003 and 2012, for example, annual football revenues for teams now in SEC jumped 91%, to 759.9 million. The college football playoff, which starts this season, and the continuing expansion of lucrative conference television networks—the SEC Network debuts on August 14—will continue to pump more riches into college sports. NCAA leaders are recognizing that in this environment, the long-criticized inequity of college sports—that none of this additional money flows into the pockets of the talent actually doing the core work, the athletes—is no longer tenable. “It’s important for the student-athletes and their welfare,” Ken Starr, president and chancellor of Baylor University, said of the vote. “There are things that we would like to do, and we need to be empowered to do those things.” While the vote is historic in nature, college sports critics contend it doesn’t go far enough. “I hope it’s the first step towards players being able to negotiate their own working conditions,” said Richard Southhall, director of the College Sport Research Institute at the University of South Carolina. “The crumbs are more nutritious than they used to be, but they’re still crumbs.” The move falls short of giving athletes in the high-revenue sports full salaries, or allowing them to capture their true worth on the open market. To college leaders, such reform would dredge up the dreaded E-word. Athletes would serve as employees, which administrators have determined is incompatible with education. “If you’re an athlete, going from 0 to 3,500, mathematically, is infinitely better,” said Andy Schwarz, an economist who has done work on behalf of the plaintiffs in the Ed O’Bannon anti-trust case, in which the former UCLA hoops star and other athletes are challenging the rights of schools to profit off their name, image and likeness without compensating them. “But qualitatively, it still misses the point entirely.” A decision in the O’Bannon case, which is pending, and a successful effort by Northwestern football players to form a union could accelerate the destruction of the NCAA’s so-called “amateurism” model. But for other critics of the NCAA’s vote, that would be a disaster. To them, autonomy for Big 5 conferences, and cost of attendance subsidies, already goes too far. It will destroy competitive balance in college sports, as the extra benefits offered by the big schools will allow them to attract even more top talent, leaving schools outside these conferences helpless. “The NCAA cannot fall prey to phony arguments about student welfare when the real goal of some of these so-called reformers is create a plutocracy,” Boise State president Bob Kustra wrote in statement in May, “that serves no useful purpose in American higher education.” Stipends for athletes, however, won’t destroy college sports. Competitive balance doesn’t really exist in college sports now, as almost all of the top high school players are already going to the top schools. In a 2011 paper entitled “Excuses, Not Reasons: 13 Myths About (Not) Paying College Athletes,” Schwarz studied 10 years worth of recruiting data and found that 99% of the high school football players listed as Top 100 prospects on Rivals.com went to power conference schools and Notre Dame. And despite this trend, football teams like Northern Illinois, and basketball teams like Wichita St., have cracked the top of the national rankings, because, as West Virginia athletic director Oliver Luck puts it, “recruiting is an art, not a science.” Plenty of talented players are overlooked by big schools, and will continue to be overlooked by big schools, even though players at top conferences are receiving a few thousands dollars extra in stipends. At lower schools, plenty of players blossom into pros, and will continue to blossom into pros, even though their Big 5 rivals are receiving some cash. Sure, a few players on the margin may choose to possibly sit on the bench at a big conference school, rather than star at the lower levels, because of the extra benefits. But all talent won’t flow upwards, because of simple supply and demand. Schools offer a finite amount of athletic scholarships; every player who wants to play basketball at Duke can’t go to Duke. So they’ll go to, say, Lehigh. And what can happen? We’ll still have charming upsets. If Lehigh could knock off the hyped stars from Duke during the 2011 NCAA tournament, they could still beat them tomorrow, even if the Duke players receive more money. “Having a little bit of cash doesn’t spoil the entire amateur status,” Luck said. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The NCAA has decided that some big colleges can make their own rules and give their athletes extra money. This means college athletes can get money for things like food, clothes, and fun activities, maybe between 2,000 to 5,000 more. The famous college sports conferences, like ACC, Big 10, Big 12, Pac 12, and SEC, can do this because they make a lot of money from sports. Some people think this is a good step, but others feel it's not enough or that it could cause problems. However, college sports should still be fun, interesting, and have surprising results even with these changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person Russell was the biographer for?, using the article: Head VI is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Irish-born figurative artist Francis Bacon, the last of six panels making up his \\"1949 Head\\" series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives the effect of a man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an airless void. Head VI was the first of Bacon's paintings to reference Velázquez, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of \\"screaming popes\\", a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works. Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in Bacon's work. The hanging object, which may be a light switch or curtain tassel, can be found even in his late paintings. The geometric cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985–86 masterpiece Study for a Self-Portrait—Triptych. Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London, in a showing organised by one of the artist's early champions, Erica Brausen. At the time, Bacon was a highly controversial but respected artist, best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion, which made him the enfant terrible of British art. Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics; John Russell, later Bacon's biographer, at the time dismissed it as a cross between \\"an alligator shorn of its jaws and an accountant in pince-nez who has come to a bad end\\". In 1989 Lawrence Gowing wrote that the \\"shock of the picture, when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable. It was everything unpardonable. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche and iconoclasm was indeed one of Bacon's most original strokes.\\" Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from Bacon's unusually productive 1949–50 period, and one of Bacon's finest popes., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question is \\"John\\". The person Russell was the biographer for is Francis Bacon, and the first name of the person is not mentioned in the article. However, John Russell is mentioned as Bacon's biographer, so it can be inferred that the friend was asking for the first name of the biographer and not the subject.

Given the below context: The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rocket artillery were developed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these metal-cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km (1 mi) range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin, Jr. in Encyclopædia Britannica (2008): Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Tipu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\\" Guess a valid title for it!

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Review: Every writer tries to manipulate his readers: he programs a response in them with the words he writes. Murakami in this book simply toyed with the readers, playing one trick on them after another. He wrote, four no maybe, five different books and cut them apart and patched different pieces of them together in a rather random order. They were all pointless, especially the main Toru Okada thread, and they generally were not pleasant reading. Maybe I feel like the first patron to buy Picasso's first abstract painting, and Picasso went on to become a recognized artist. But this first patron may have never changed his mind that what Picasso sold him was a piece of junk, and the rest of the world is a bit crazy not to have noticed. Answer: A:","completion":"The tone of the product review provided is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the book, stating that the author manipulated the readers in an unpleasant way. They go on to mention that the different stories in the book are randomly put together, making them feel pointless. In addition, the reviewer compares their experience to that of someone who buys a piece of art that is regarded as junk, implying that their perception of the book is negative. Furthermore, the title \\"I feel I've been manipulated\\" foreshadows a negative outlook, as it communicates the reviewer's negative experience and feelings towards the book. The comparison to Picasso's first patron also suggests that the reviewer has a strong negative opinion of the book because, like the patron who never changed his mind regarding Picasso's work, the reviewer implies that they are unlikely to change their negative view of the book.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Gulf War, commander, George H. W. Bush. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The Gulf War was a significant military operation that took place between August 2, 1990 and February 28, 1991 in the Middle East, primarily in Iraq and Kuwait. This conflict is sometimes referred to as Operation Desert Shield, which was the initial defensive response to the Iraq invasion of Kuwait, and Operation Desert Storm, which was the offensive operation led by the United States and a coalition of international forces to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. At the helm of this strategic military campaign was the commander, then-President of the United States George H. W. Bush. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, tensions between Iraq and Kuwait had escalated due to various economic and political factors, including border disputes and disagreements related to oil production. The Iraqi President at the time, Saddam Hussein, accused Kuwait of overproducing oil, which contributed to a decline in oil prices and, consequently, negatively impacted the Iraqi economy. In need of financial resources, Iraq invaded and quickly occupied Kuwait on August 2, 1990. The international community swiftly condemned this act of aggression, and the United Nations Security Council passed numerous resolutions demanding the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. In response to this crisis, U.S. President George H. W. Bush spearheaded diplomatic efforts to assemble a multinational coalition of forces to counter the Iraqi aggression and ultimately liberate Kuwait. This coalition consisted of more than 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and other nations from across the Middle East and Europe. As the commander of the coalition's military efforts, George H. W. Bush initiated Operation Desert Shield, which focused on the deployment of a significant number of U.S. and international troops, as well as naval, air, and ground forces, to the Arabian Peninsula. The main objective of this operation was to create a deterrent to prevent further Iraqi aggression and protect key regional allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, from potential attacks. During this period, Bush, his administration, and military leaders worked tirelessly to drum up international support for their cause and carefully plan the military operations that would ensue. After several months of preparatory operations, diplomatic negotiations, and an international economic embargo against Iraq, President George H. W. Bush launched Operation Desert Storm on January 17, 1991. This offensive operation included a large-scale air campaign, which targeted Iraqi military infrastructure, as well as its command and control systems. The ultimate goal was to weaken Saddam Hussein's regime and force the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Following weeks of sustained aerial bombardment, coalition ground forces began a rapid and decisive ground campaign that took advantage of the weakened Iraqi military's lack of coordinated defense. As a result, the coalition successfully liberated Kuwait on February 28, 1991. In total, the war resulted in a low number of U.S. and coalition casualties compared to the substantial losses experienced by Iraq's military and civilian populations. In conclusion, the Gulf War was a pivotal moment in modern military history as it showcased the ability of a large coalition of countries to act in unison against a common aggressor. Under the firm leadership of George H. W. Bush, the coalition forces successfully conducted a well-planned and executed military campaign that achieved their objectives. The rapid and decisive victory not only liberated Kuwait but also reinforced the credibility of the United Nations and the international community's commitment to upholding the principles of global peace and security."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"He added, \\"Artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What came as an expense of live singing?\\"","completion":"While the given answer provides an insight into the evolution of live performances by mentioning artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson, it does not explicitly address the expense of live singing. A more comprehensive and detailed answer would be as follows: The expense of live singing can be attributed to multiple factors arising from the increasingly complex and high-quality production values that have become an essential part of modern live performances. These factors may include enhanced visual and audio elements, highly athletic dancing, and the use of advanced technology, all of which have the potential to impact the quality of live singing. One of the most significant expenses of live singing comes from the elaborate stage productions that have become a norm in the entertainment industry. Shows by iconic artists like Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Michael Jackson have set new standards for showmanship. These concerts showcase breathtaking visual elements, such as intricate stage designs, elaborate costumes, and precision-timed pyrotechnics, which, while stunning, can potentially affect live performances due to their complexity and requirement of extensive preparation and rehearsals. Furthermore, live performances have evolved to incorporate highly athletic dancing routines. As artists' dedication to delivering visually spectacular performances has grown, the intricate and intense choreography has become a staple of many modern live concerts. This heightened emphasis on dance can lead to artists lip-syncing as they execute these physically demanding routines, as it becomes challenging to maintain a high standard of vocal performance while also delivering flawless dance moves. This trade-off comes at the expense of live singing, a fact that some fans may find disappointing. Additionally, the increasing use of technology in live performances brings both significant benefits and challenges. On the one hand, advanced audio systems, lighting, and special effects can enhance the overall experience for the audience, creating a memorable event. On the other hand, the reliance on technology can also hinder live singing. The use of pre-recorded tracks, vocal effects, and auto-tune may impair the purity and authenticity of the artist's live vocal performance, leading to debates on the ethics of such practices in live performances. In conclusion, the expense of live singing can be attributed to several factors, such as elaborate stage productions, highly athletic dancing, and the use of technology. While these developments contribute to creating visually stunning and memorable live performances, they can also detract from the authenticity and quality of live singing, as artists may opt to lip-sync or use technological aids to maintain a seamless performance in the face of increasing physical and logistical demands on stage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: When did the CAA begin to exptend it's ATC responsibilities? Is The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation. a good answer to this question?","completion":"While the statement \\"The application of radar to ATC helped controllers in their drive to keep abreast of the postwar boom in commercial air transportation\\" offers some insight into the technological advancements that occurred alongside the expansion of commercial air transportation, it does not provide a detailed response to the question \\"When did the CAA begin to extend its ATC responsibilities?\\" A more in-depth answer would provide the historical context and background for the timeline of the Civil Aeronautics Authority's (CAA) growth in their Air Traffic Control (ATC) responsibilities. The Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) was created in 1938 through the Civil Aeronautics Act. This organization was initially responsible for regulating various aspects of civil aviation in the United States, including air traffic control, safety regulations, and economic oversight. Over the years, as the aviation industry grew and evolved, the CAA underwent transformations and expanded its responsibilities in response to emerging challenges and technological advancements. The CAA initially began extending its ATC responsibilities following World War II, as there was a significant increase in commercial air transportation during the postwar years. In response to the growing demand for air transportation, the CAA began gradually implementing new changes and improvements. Multiple factors contributed to the CAA's expansion of ATC responsibilities, including legislation, technological advancements, and operational events that highlighted the need for enhanced air traffic control systems. In 1946, President Truman signed the Federal Airport Act, which provided federal funding for the development of the National Airport System and led to improvements in air traffic control infrastructure throughout the country. This act meant that the CAA played a more significant role in the development and management of civilian airports, which in turn required expansions in their ATC responsibilities. The introduction of radar systems for air traffic control purposes in the late 1940s and early 1950s was a critical technological advancement that enabled the CAA to keep up with the expanding air transportation industry. It allowed controllers to better manage airspace and monitor aircraft position and speed. This technology provided them with better tools for managing air traffic, ultimately enhancing safety and efficiency throughout the system. During the 1950s and 1960s, several high-profile midair collisions between commercial aircraft prompted further expansions of ATC capabilities and responsibilities. These tragic events highlighted the need for stricter coordination and control of airspace. In response to these incidents, the CAA implemented various upgrades and improvements, including the establishment of new Air Route Traffic Control Centers and the modernization of radar technology to achieve better coverage. In 1958, the Federal Aviation Act was passed which resulted in the formation of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), replacing the CAA as the primary government organization responsible for regulating and advancing civil aviation within the United States. Under the FAA, the ATC system continued to grow and evolve in response to industry needs and emerging technologies, such as automation and satellite-based navigation systems. In summary, the CAA began extending its ATC responsibilities following World War II to better cope with the postwar boom in commercial air transportation and enhance safety throughout the industry. The CAA's commitment to expanding its role in ATC was influenced by factors such as relevant legislation, technological advancements such as radar, and operational events prompting improvements within the system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To call \\"The Crater Lake Monster\\" amateurish is to overstate the obvious. If you aren't a fan of low budget drive-in films, you probably wouldn't be looking here in the first place. The problem with the movie is that when there's no monster action going on, it really sucks and goes nowhere. The script is very Ed Wood-ish, in that it's utterly contrived in the way it sets up the main action sequences. Nothing is too outlandish for \\"The Crater Lake Monster\\". It explains its dinosaur by having a meteor crash into Crater Lake, 'superheating' the water to the point where it incubates a dinosaur egg that has apparently been resting at the bottom of the lake for millennia. Even if we could accept that the egg could have been lying there for so long and remained uncovered and viable, wouldn't \\"superheating\\" the water to such a high temperature cause most of the lake to evaporate? Other than some token fog in one or two scenes, we see no evidence of the water being hot, other than a few lines in the script. The script is padded rather obviously in a few sequences, and it will do anything to get the characters near the lake so that they can be menaced by the claymation dino. A couple just passing through experiences car trouble and while their automobile is being serviced, they decide to rent a boat and head out into Crater Lake. Hmmmm...do you think these strangers in the story could be there so they would run into our title monstrosity? In a sequence that's just plain bizarre, a drunk robs a liquor store and decides to murder the cashier and a bystander instead of paying four dollars for a bottle of booze. A car chase ensues, and wouldn't ya know it...they end up right by the lake. Snack time for Cratey! Yeah, it's not hard to figure out, and you're so far ahead of the script that you're irritated when it takes another ten minutes for these scenes to unfold. The shamelessness of it all is endearing, and I really want to like \\"The Crater Lake Monster\\". I just can't do it. There's not enough here to go on, and this is more of a movie to put on during a party, because you could talk right over it and it wouldn't matter. The film has a slim list of the things going for it, the most important being the dinosaur itself, which appears in three forms: a shadow puppet, a large model head that is dragged woodenly through the water, and a fully realized claymation insert that actually looks pretty good. There are also a pair of lovable hicks in it, and they carry the majority of the intentional humor in the movie. A downbeat ending leaves us mourning the death of both the monster AND one of our beloved hicks, so every good thing about this film is dead by the end of it.

Article: The World Bank is warning that the West Africa Ebola outbreak could seriously harm the economies of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone unless action is taken quickly. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim spoke to reporters recently to discuss the effects of the Ebola spread. \\"Our findings show that if the virus continues to spread, the economic cost to these countries could grow eight times by 2015. This would be a big _ to their already weak economies,\\" said Kim. Mr. Kim says, \\"saving lives and preventing new spread\\" is most important. The bank has given 117-million for an \\"immediate help.\\" The World Bank President says the SARS outbreak between 2002 and 2004 showed how a disease could damage economies. 800 people died from SARS and the economic losses were up to 40-billion. Mr. Kim says SARS and the H1N1 outbreak of 2009 taught that fear and avoidance resulted in about 90-percent of the economic losses. That means the disease is causing two levels of economic damage. \\"There are two kinds of contagion . One is connected with the virus itself and the second is connected with the spread of fear about the virus,\\" said Kim. The World Bank thinks the losses to the economies of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea will be big .Mr. Kim says losses could be about 97-million at the moment. Mr. Kim says fast action is necessary. He says getting the disease under control is still far away. That is because there are not enough health care workers in the affected areas.

Available choices: -- a cold person; -- a nice person; -- a mean person; Answer:","completion":"Given the context provided, Aubrey can be described as a nice person. This is based on the action of leaning towards Lee to give them a kiss, which demonstrates warmth, affection, and a certain level of intimacy. It is important to note that a single action may not be enough to judge a person's entire character, but in this specific scenario, Aubrey appears to be expressing kindness and care for Lee. A nice person generally exhibits positive attributes, such as friendliness, warmth, empathy, and understanding towards others. They tend to treat others with respect and often display a genuine concern for their well-being. While this particular situation may not encompass the entire range of characteristics that define a nice person, it does provide an indication that Aubrey is exhibiting some of these qualities towards Lee. It is worth mentioning that there could be different aspects to Aubrey's character which may not be completely evident in this brief interaction.

Information: - Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized. - Stephan Groth ( born August 10 , 1971 in Odense , Denmark ) is the man behind Apoptygma Berzerk , an electronic body music act that plays in styles such as synthpop , ebm , and futurepop . Stephan Leonard Groth was born in Odense , Denmark but relocated with his family to his father 's home town Sarpsborg , Norway in 1986 . Along with Ronan Harris of VNV Nation and the members of Covenant , he is considered by many to be one of the pioneers of the futurepop genre of the late 1990s and early 2000s . Groth is also a member of Fairlight Children , which is a lighter , more pop - oriented electronic act . Stephan took guest appearance in Satyricon 's album Megiddo . - Area is the quantity that expresses the extent of a two-dimensional figure or shape, or planar lamina, in the plane. Surface area is its analog on the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional object. Area can be understood as the amount of material with a given thickness that would be necessary to fashion a model of the shape, or the amount of paint necessary to cover the surface with a single coat. It is the two-dimensional analog of the length of a curve (a one-dimensional concept) or the volume of a solid (a three-dimensional concept). - Art rock is a subgenre of rock music that generally reflects a challenging or avant-garde approach to rock, or which makes use of modernist, experimental, or unconventional elements. Art rock aspires to elevate rock from teen entertainment to an artistic statement, opting for a more experimental and conceptual outlook on music. Influences may be drawn from several genres, such as experimental rock, avant-garde music, classical music, and jazz. - Kraftwerk (\\"\\"power station\\"\\") is a German electronic music band formed by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider in 1970 in Düsseldorf. In the 1970s, they were among the first successful pop acts to popularize electronic music and are widely considered to be innovators and pioneers of the genre. The band was fronted by both Hütter and Schneider until Schneider's departure in 2008. - Borders are geographic boundaries of political entities or legal jurisdictions, such as governments, sovereign states, federated states, and other subnational entities. Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries. - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - VNV Nation is an English/Irish electronic music band originally from Dublin and Essex and now based in Hamburg, Germany. They combine elements of synthpop, trance and electronic body music (EBM). The members are Ronan Harris and Mark Jackson. The \\"VNV\\" in the name stands for \\"Victory Not Vengeance\\", in keeping with the group's motto, \\"One should strive to achieve, not sit in bitter regret.\\" - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Icon of Coil is a Norwegian electronic music band. The band was established as a solo project in 1997 by Andy LaPlegua who was joined by former Sector 9 (now Moonitor and Zombie Girl) bandmate Sebastian Komor to perform live. With the release of \\"Shallow Nation\\", the band's first single, Komor joined full-time. In 2000, Christian Lund joined the live lineup. Later that year the band's first full-length album, \\"Serenity is the Devil\\", was released, which climbed to number one on the Deutsche Alternative Charts. Shortly thereafter, Lund became a full-time band member. - Unheilig (German for \\"Unholy\\") is a German band that features a variety of influences including various pop and electronic styles as well as harder, nihilistic hard rock. The band was founded in 1999 and principally consists of singer Bernd Heinrich \\"Der Graf\\" Graf along with various musical partners. He has been accompanied for live shows with musicians Christoph \\"Licky\\" Termühlen, Henning Verlage, and Martin \\"Potti\\" Potthoff. The group's debut, \\"Phosphor\\", came out in 2000. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Sarpsborg , historically Borg, is a city and municipality in Østfold county, Norway. The administrative centre of the municipality is the city of Sarpsborg. - Beborn Beton is a German synthpop band founded in 1989, with their first album release in 1993. Their debut named \\"Tybalt\\" is a compilation of the best tracks written in the first three years of their band history and was very well received in the electronic music scene. In 1995 the follow-up album \\"Concrete Ground\\" was released. After a change of record label in 1996 their break-through album \\"Nightfall\\" was published featuring the club-filler \\"Im Innern Einer Frau\\". - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - Odense is the third-largest city in Denmark. It has a population of 175,245 as of January 2016, and is the main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, to the south of Aarhus and to the southwest of Copenhagen. The city is the seat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense County until 1970, and Funen County from 1970 until 1 January 2007, when Funen County became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense has close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is remembered above all for his fairy tales. He was born in the city in 1805 and spent his childhood years there. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\". - Hans Christian Andersen (often referred to in Scandinavia as H. C. Andersen; (2 April 1805 4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called in Danish, express themes that transcend age and nationality. - Apoptygma Berzerk (commonly abbreviated to APB or APOP) is a Norwegian musical group. They have achieved success with a brand of synthpop, and ballads backed with electronic rhythms, commonly known within the scene and referring to themselves as \\"futurepop\\". Apoptygma Berzerk has over 30 releases and won awards and Top 10 spots in Germany and Scandinavia. Apoptygma Berzerk has toured Europe, North America, South America, Israel and Australia with bands such as VNV Nation, Beborn Beton, Icon of Coil and Unheilig. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Electronic body music (EBM) is a music genre that combines elements of post-industrial music and electropunk. It first came to prominence in Belgium and was considered a part of the European new wave movement. - Shetland , also called the Shetland Islands, is a subarctic archipelago that lies northeast of the island of Great Britain and forms part of Scotland, United Kingdom. - Bouvet Island (Norwegian: Bouvetøya, previously spelled Bouvet-øya) is an uninhabited subantarctic high island and dependency of Norway located in the South Atlantic Ocean at .

Telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of Crom-Cruic, the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology. In hopes of recovering a lost artefact.

This consensus shows a sense of collaborative effort and the recognition of the significance of the organization among its members. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an intergovernmental organization that regulates and facilitates international trade between nations. Established in 1995, the main goal of the WTO is to ensure that trade flows smoothly, predictably, and freely across the globe. This is achieved by providing a framework for negotiating trade agreements and settling disputes among its member states. The organization has several key aspects it needs to function effectively.

These negotiations lead to new or revised international trade agreements. 2. Dispute resolution: WTO has a mechanism that allows member states to settle disputes related to trade policies and practices. The Dispute Settlement Body ensures that disputes are resolved in a timely and fair manner, making sure that member states adhere to the agreements they have entered. 3. Monitoring and review of trade policies: The WTO keeps track of the trade policies and practices of its member states. This is done through various mechanisms, including Trade Policy Reviews, which help ensure transparency and evaluate the effectiveness of these policies. 4. Capacity building and technical assistance: The WTO offers various programs to help its member states, particularly developing and least-developed countries, build their capacity to engage in international trade. These programs include technical assistance, training, and support for implementing WTO agreements. Overall, the members of the WTO recognize the potential benefits that the organization can bring to the table, which is why they have reached an agreement about its ability and necessity to function effectively. By working together and supporting the organization's goals, members can ensure a more equitable, transparent, and collaborative international trading system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Shrek Forever After Movie plot: Shrek has grown steadily tired of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to yearn for the days when he felt like a \\"real ogre\\". When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \\"WANTED\\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Stiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down. Upon inquiry, Stiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or never met Donkey, and consequently Stiltskin was able to get King Harold and Queen Lillian to sign their kingdom away, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Stiltskin's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \\"true love's kiss\\". They soon encounter a band of ogres who are resisting Stiltskin. The ogres are led by a still-cursed Fiona who, after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, keeps the retired and overweight Puss in Boots as a pet.

It's almost a cross between a philosophy and a history, but written in a light/easy to read way. Most books on business tend to be detailed, technical, or boring--this book tells business as if it were a story. (Which it is)Very few business books are written in this style and by doing so he captures some of the feelings and passion of business along with a few strategic concepts. Business comes from the heart as well as the head and I appreciate the way this book combines both aspects.On the other hand, I had some reservation giving 5 stars. While he extensively chronicles his own business--there are few/no references to other businesses and/or collaborating evidence. Still, I would recommend this book to any budding businessperson--but I'd also recommend reading from other authors (I recommend Peter Drucker) to gain a wider perspective.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Question: \\"Who could be called the first Chinese inventor?\\" Answer: \\"Peking man\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. The first Chinese inventor could be called \\"Peking Man\\" because he learned how to capture and maintain fire, which was a significant breakthrough in technology and society at that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To understand why this conclusion can be drawn, we can break down the statement and analyze its components: 1. The oldest section of Havana is described as the city's most spectacular. 2. Restoration work and gleaming coats of pastel colonial colors, as well as a stern police presence, contribute to a slightly more sanitized feel in parts of the oldest section. 3. The weathered working-class neighborhoods that extend along the water and inland are mentioned, which implies a comparison with the oldest section of Havana.

The spectacular nature of the oldest section is a result of its restoration works, pastel colonial colors, and the overall ambiance, making it distinct from other sections such as weathered working-class neighborhoods.

Title: The Talented Mr. Ripley Movie plot: Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While playing piano at a cocktail party in New York City, he is approached by wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who mistakenly believes that Ripley went to Princeton University with his son, Dickie, because Ripley is wearing a borrowed Princeton blazer. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy and persuade Dickie to return to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley 1,000 (equivalent to 8,834 in 2015). Ripley accepts the proposal, even though he did not attend Princeton and has never met Dickie. Upon arriving by ship in Europe, Ripley meets a wealthy textile heiress named Meredith Logue. During their brief conversation, he impulsively pretends to be Dickie, later commenting in voice-over that \\"it is better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" Shortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley fakes a chance encounter on the beach with Dickie and his fiancÃ©e, Marge Sherwood. Ripley later discloses to Dickie and Marge that Mr. Greenleaf paid him to travel to Europe and persuade Dickie to return home. This revelation infuriates Dickie; he declines the invitation and suggests Ripley go back to America and inform his father that he has no intention of ever returning. Ripley instead ingratiates himself into Dickie's life under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. The two concoct a scheme for Ripley to wring additional funds from Greenleaf by regularly mailing letters suggesting Dickie is wavering and will likely return to America if Ripley can remain in Italy and continue applying pressure. On a jaunt to Rome, Ripley meets Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt. A local girl, pregnant by Dickie, drowns herself after he refuses to help her financially; this sends Dickie into a downward spiral. He begins tiring of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has...

Bozz has no desire to go to war and acts like it. Even though his weekend leave is withdrawn he still goes to town and ends up going to a hotel room with two girls and fellow soldier Paxton (Matthew Davis). Bozz and Paxton make friends despite their different outlooks; Paxton has enlisted for service and wants to go to Nam for the experience.At the base, while Bozz shows that he is capable of being a good soldier when he wants to, he continues to attract disciplinary penalties as well as the anger of fellow privates, especially one named Wilson (Shea Whigham).

Please answer this question: What is the two-word term used for a tennis match where the final score is 6-0,6-0?","completion":"The two-word term used for a tennis match where the final score is 6-0, 6-0 is called a \\"double bagel.\\" This term is derived from the shape of a bagel, which represents the number \\"0\\" because of its round shape with a hole in the center. A \\"double bagel\\" scoreline signifies a completely dominant performance by one player, who manages to win two sets without conceding a single game to their opponent. In professional tennis, such a result is relatively rare, as the skill level of players at this level is usually well-matched and extremely competitive. However, when a double bagel does occur, it usually indicates that one player was in exceptional form or their opponent failed to find their rhythm or struggled with various issues, possibly even including injury. While 6-0, 6-0 is a definitive victory for the winning player, they typically gain no extra advantage in terms of tournament rankings or prize money beyond what they would receive for any other victory at that stage of the competition. However, it certainly boosts their confidence, as well as earning them a place in the tennis history books for outstanding performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In your case, the passion you have is joining the Army Reserves, which is supported by your mom but opposed by your dad. It is essential to consider various aspects before making a well-informed decision. Here are some factors that you might want to consider: 1. Personal Fulfillment: Assess your motivations for wanting to join the Army Reserves. Why do you feel passionate about this path, and how much personal fulfillment do you anticipate it will bring you? Personal satisfaction is vital for maintaining a long-term commitment to any profession. 2. Career Prospects: It is essential to consider the career prospects offered by the Army Reserves. How will joining the reserves impact your education, employment opportunities, and potential for advancement? Are there alternative routes to achieving your goals that might be more beneficial for your future? 3. Emotional and Mental Well-being: The emotional and mental well-being of individuals is significantly affected by their chosen career paths. The military can be both physically and emotionally challenging. Do you believe you are ready to handle the emotional and mental rigors of military service? 4. Family Dynamics: Consider your parental relationship and the role your parents play in your decision-making. Are both of your parents' opinions equally important to you, or do you feel more inclined to follow one parent's advice over the other? It is essential to maintain a healthy relationship and communication with both parents, irrespective of what decision you make. 5. Financial Considerations: Joining the military can have implications on your financial stability. The benefits, apart from salary, could include educational assistance, healthcare, and housing allowance. However, it's important to compare these benefits with potential earnings in another field that aligns with your passion. Now, moving on to your question whether both questions have the same meaning or not. While they may not have precisely the same meaning, they interlink with each other substantially. The first question is a general query about whether to follow one's passion or to do what one's parents say. In contrast, the second question provides a context (joining the Army Reserves) for the dilemma. Both questions are based on making a choice between personal desires and parental guidance. In conclusion, examine each consideration carefully, gather as much information as you can, and engage in open and honest discussions with your parents about your desires and concerns. Reflect on what you genuinely feel is the best course of action for you, ensuring that you feel confident making your decision based on your passions, family dynamics, and future prospects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The three primary members were John Strohm, Freda Love (born Freda Boner), and Juliana Hatfield, with Evan Dando, Andrew Mayer, Seth White, Anthony DeLuca (who played drums in place of Freda for the group's last European tour in early 1992), and Mike Leahy each also performing as members of the band at times. - The Backsliders are an alternative-traditional country-rock band composed of Chip Robinson, Steve Howell, Danny Kurtz, Jeff Dennis, and Brad Rice. Chip Robinson teamed up with Steve Howell to form The Backsliders, which began as a duo in 1991 in Athens, GA. The group formed in 1994, and disbanded in 1999. The band has reunited in late 2012. - The Chainsaw Kittens were a part of the American alternative rock scene, drawing from pop, glam rock, punk, new wave and British Invasion music. Their lyrics tackled such varied topics as religion, the Stonewall Riots, Federico Fellini, Oklahoma, Erik Menendez, and Oscar Wilde. - Melvins are an American rock band that formed in 1983 in Montesano, Washington. They have mostly performed as a trio, as well as a quartet with two drummers in recent years. Since 1984, vocalist and guitarist Buzz Osborne and drummer Dale Crover have been constant members. The band was named after a supervisor at a Thriftway in Montesano, Washington, where Osborne also worked as a clerk. \\"Melvin\\" was despised by other employees, and the band's members felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name. Their early work was key to the development of both grunge and sludge metal. - Frente! (or Frente) are an Australian alternative rock and folk-pop group which originally formed in 1989. The original line-up consisted of Simon Austin on guitar and backing vocals, Angie Hart on lead vocals, Tim O'Connor on bass guitar (later replaced by Bill McDonald), and Mark Picton on drums (later replaced by Alastair Barden, then by Pete Luscombe). In August 1991 they issued their debut extended play, \\"Whirled\\", which included the track, \\"Labour of Love\\". In March 1992 they released a second EP, \\"Clunk\\", with its featured track, \\"Ordinary Angels\\", which peaked at No. 3 on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was followed in October by \\"Kelly Street\\" (unintentional misprint of \\"Accidentally Kelly Street\\" was retained) which reached No. 4. Their debut album, Marvin the Album, issued in November, peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. \\"Labour of Love\\" was released as an EP outside of Australasia in 1994 as a CD single with a cover version of New Order's \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" included. The Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane felt that the group's \\"quirky, irreverent, acoustic-based sound was at odds with the usual guitar-heavy, grunge trends of the day. The band's presentation had a tweeness about it that could have been off-putting if not for its genuine freshness and honesty\\". - Chapel Hill is a city in Orange County, North Carolina (with some eastern portions in Durham County), and the home of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and UNC Health Care.

Context: This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. Question: What does the investigative journalist group ProPublica think about separating children from their parents?

I continue to serve on the board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts. As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself. Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease. Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die. Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year. JDF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money raised goes directly to research. Enron's goal this year is to raise 225,000 and we need your help. Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place! We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal. The theme for the walk this year is \\"Knock Out Diabetes\\" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.

The Falkirk players used good teamwork and scored more goals than Dunfermline Athletic. By winning this match, Falkirk was able to stay in third place in the Scottish Championship.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose marriage to a taxi driver is on the rocks?, using the article: Gloria, a downtrodden housewife, lives with her husband Antonio, mother-in-law and two sons in a small, shabby and overcrowded apartment located by the Madrid motorway. Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \\"I'm the master of my own body.\\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling heroin. The grandmother, who is addicted to soft drinks, shares the same dream of returning to her native village. Gloria's friends are her two neighbors: Cristal and Juani. Cristal is a prostitute with a heart of gold. Juani, is a bitter woman obsessed with cleanliness and vulgar ornaments, her daughter, Vanesa, has telekinetic powers, which she uses to destroy their apartment., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Whose marriage to a taxi driver is on the rocks?\\" as per the provided article, is Gloria. Gloria is depicted as a hardworking woman who has to juggle between her roles as a wife, mother, caretaker, and a cleaning lady. Her life is overwhelming as she lives in a crowded and substandard apartment located by the Madrid motorway, along with her mother-in-law, two sons, and her husband Antonio. To manage her demanding life, Gloria resorts to using amphetamines. Antonio, Gloria's husband, is described as a male chauvinist who works as a taxi driver. Their marital relationship is unstable and strained, and consequently, their marriage is on the rocks. The instability mentioned can partly be attributed to Antonio's past affair that seems to linger and affect their marriage. Antonio had a brief relationship, fifteen years earlier in Germany, with Ingrid Muller, a German singer for whom he had worked as a driver. This infidelity's remnants, including a signed photograph of Ingrid and a song of hers that Antonio keeps playing, seem to irritate Gloria, further contributing to the tension between them. Additionally, Antonio seems to be occupied with a sinister plot to forge Hitler's diaries for profit along with Lucas, a writer he met during his taxi duties. This venture and Antonio's attempts to tutor one of their sons in forgery don't paint a positive image of him and could be causing further strain on their relationship. From the article, Gloria's life can be seen as chaotic and stressful with various dramatic elements surrounding her family and herself. Given this situation, her unstable marriage to Antonio, the taxi driver, is evidently rocky. She has to endure her husband's chauvinistic attitudes, memories of his past affair, and his dubious activities, all while managing the household and working as a cleaning lady to support the family. Hence, the answer to your friend's question is Gloria."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Not every shot in cricket can be a scoring shot. When a ball is well bowled, use a forward defensive shot to avoid being called out. Having a solid defense is a crucial part of being a good batsman. Lean your head and front shoulder forward. Take a step with the front foot while keeping the back leg straight. Swing the bat downward and contact the ball as it passes below the eyes. Keep the bat angled so the face is toward the ground. The bat should end up slightly ahead of your front leg and close the side of the pad. Do not follow through. Keep the heel of your back foot off the ground and hold the position to have the best chance to block the ball. This shot is usually played when a full delivery on middle or off stump. It is one of the most common shots and usually the first one learned by cricket players. Depending on the direction the ball travels, this shot can be referred to as a cover drive, off drive, straight drive, on drive, or square drive. Lean forward and step with your front foot. Bend your front knee. This will give you a solid base for the shot. Your head should ahead or level with the front knee and your back foot should be up on the toe during the swing. Swing the bat straight and contact the ball when it is below the eyes. Keep your wrists relaxed and the bat angled to keep the drive low. Follow through should continue on a straight path so that the bat face is toward the sky. This shot is great to use against spinners. When you see a low-bouncing ball on the legside, go to the sweep shot. Lean your head and front shoulder forward. Stride with your front foot so the pad is in the path of the ball. Drop your back knee to the ground. Lift the bat to a high backswing then bring the bat down and across the body. Strike the ball in front of the pad. Roll your wrists slightly when you make contact to angle the ball downward. Follow through. Bring your hands around after striking the ball so they end up near your front shoulder with the bat held high in the air. This shot relies on the speed of the bowled ball as opposed to the power of the hitter. A front foot leg glance is best used to play balls delivered off to the leg side. Lean forward with your head and front shoulder. Shift your weight to your front leg. Bring the bat straight through. Angle the bat face slightly toward your front leg during the stroke. Make contact in front of the front leg pad. Flick your top wrist to glance the shot downward. This shot relies on control and precision to deflect the ball as opposed to a powerful swing. Summary:","completion":"In cricket, using various shots like the forward defensive shot, cover drive, sweep shot, and front foot leg glance helps in scoring and blocking, depending on the ball situation, making good defense an important skill for a batsman."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"After thoroughly researching the information related to the 2012 Rose Bowl Game, I am providing the following revised answer. To answer the initial question, the Rose Bowl Game of 2012 took place on January 2, 2012. Regarding the suggested answer, it is not entirely accurate. The 2012 Rose Bowl Game was indeed a historic event, but not because it was the first time a team from a non-Automatic Qualifying Conference played and won the Rose Bowl. In fact, the two teams that participated in that game were the University of Oregon Ducks (Pac-12 Conference) and the University of Wisconsin Badgers (Big Ten Conference), both of which belong to Automatic Qualifying Conferences. The Oregon Ducks emerged as the champions with a score of 45-38. The confusion in the suggested answer could be due to the fact that it is referring to the 2007 Fiesta Bowl between Boise State (a non-AQ Conference team) and Oklahoma, in which Boise State won in a memorable overtime victory. This, however, is not related to the 2012 Rose Bowl Game. Therefore, you should not validate the suggested answer as it contains significant inaccuracies. Here is a revised response: The 2012 Rose Bowl Game took place on January 2, 2012, featuring the University of Oregon Ducks (Pac-12 Conference) and the University of Wisconsin Badgers (Big Ten Conference). The University of Oregon Ducks were victorious with a final score of 45-38 in this historic bowl game.

This text is missing some spaces, please add them: In1934heprovedaspecialcaseofhisconjecturenamelythataxistranscendentalifaisalgebraic(a0,1)andxisanirrationalalgebraicnumber.","completion":"In 1934, he proved a special case of his conjecture, namely that a number in the form of \\"ax\\" is transcendental if \\"a\\" is an algebraic number (distinct from 0 and 1) and \\"x\\" is an irrational algebraic number. To better understand this statement, let's break it down further: 1. A transcendental number is a real or complex number that is not the root of any non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. In other words, transcendental numbers cannot be expressed as the solution to any algebraic equation with rational coefficients. Examples of transcendental numbers include π (pi) and e. 2. Algebraic numbers, on the other hand, are the root of some non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. The simplest examples of algebraic numbers are the integers and rational numbers, but many irrational numbers are also algebraic, such as the square root of 2. 3. An irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction. It has a non-terminating and non-repeating decimal representation. Well-known irrational numbers include the square root of 2 and the golden ratio. So, the mentioned conjecture states that if you have a number \\"a\\" which is distinct from 0 and 1, and is algebraic, and you have an irrational algebraic number \\"x\\", then the product \\"ax\\" will be transcendental. In 1934, this special case of the conjecture was proven, making it an important milestone in the study of transcendental numbers and the relationship between algebraic and transcendental elements within the realm of mathematics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: oodbye now. Putting off going to visit a loved one in the hospital is always a mistake, as is waiting until the last days before a friend leaves the country forever. Don't miss out on your chance to say goodbye and brighten their final moments. Alone in the hospital can be a terrible place to die. Be in the room and say what needs to be said. Spend as much time with your loved one as possible. Be with him or her and support them. Often, the dying want and are very comforted by one of four very particular messages: \\"I love you,\\" \\"I forgive you,\\" \\"Please forgive me,\\" or \\"Thank you.\\" If any of these seem appropriate, take care to include them in your goodbye. We often have the impression that death or other \\"forever\\" goodbyes are supposed to be a somber and joyless thing. But follow the lead of the person leaving. Your role is to be there for them and to comfort them in a time of need. If laughter is desired, or seems natural, then laugh. It can be hard to know how honest to be with the dying. If you're visiting an ex-spouse or an estranged sibling, there can be lots of tension burbling under the surface, and complicated emotions at work in their passing. The hospital doesn't seem like the best time to let loose and tell off your father for being absent. If you feel like the truth will hurt the person dying, recognize this and change the subject. Say, \\"You don't need to worry about me today\\" and change the subject. It can be tempting to want to be overly optimistic, saying \\"No, there's still a chance. Don't give up\\" if a loved one says, \\"I'm dying.\\" There's no need to dwell on something neither of you know for sure. Change the subject to, \\"How are you feeling today?\\" or reassure them by saying, \\"You look great today.\\" Always speak gently and identify yourself as the person speaking. Even if you're not sure you're being heard, say what needs to be said. The goodbye process in death works both ways--make sure you don't regret not saying \\"I love you\\" one last time. Even if you're unsure if the person can hear you, say it, and you'll know. Both physically and emotionally, be in the room. It can be difficult to avoid becoming hyperaware of the significance of the moment: \\"Is that the last time he'll say, 'I love you'?\\" Every moment can feel tense and electric. But get out of your own way and try, as much as possible, to experience the moments for what they are: time with a loved one. Often, the dying have a great amount of control over the actual moment of their death and will wait until they're alone to save their loved ones the pain of experiencing it. Likewise, many family members are committed to being there, \\"To the end.\\" Be aware of this and try not to put too much emphasis on the exact moment of death. Say goodbye when it seems appropriate. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of not postponing visits to loved ones in the hospital and highlights the value of expressing love, forgiveness, and gratitude during those final moments. It also encourages providing emotional support, adapting to the departing person's emotional state, and not focusing on the exact moment of death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Nazarbayev Looks to Have Won Re-Election as Kazakhstan President SEMEY, Kazakhstan — This spring’s hasty campaign season in Kazakhstan has sometimes felt like a pep rally for Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the steelworker-turned-Communist-Party-boss who has ruled the country since 1989. That impression was heightened on Sunday when one of the president’s three challengers acknowledged that he, too, had voted for Mr. Nazarbayev. “I am sure that the current president will be the victor, so I am giving him my vote as well,” the challenger, Mels Yeleusizov, an environmental activist, told the Interfax news service as he emerged from a polling station in the city of Almaty. He said his family was voting for Mr. Nazarbayev as well. The president, who called snap elections two years ahead of schedule, won by 94.8 percent, according to an exit poll by the Association of Sociologists and Political Scientists of Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, early results from the Central Election Committee suggested that turnout was an extraordinarily high 89.9 percent, despite opposition leaders who denounced the election as a farce and encouraged voters to stay home. Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, is credited with making oil-rich Kazakhstan into Central Asia’s island of stability, but he has drawn criticism from the West for stifling dissent. In February, seeking to shore up his reputation as an international statesman, Mr. Nazarbayev abruptly rejected the idea of a referendum that would have granted him the presidency until 2020. The election provided an even playing field, he told reporters on Sunday. “All candidates had equal opportunities to visit regions and had access to mass media,” Mr. Nazarbayev said on Sunday, as he emerged from the country’s National Academic Library, a grandiose new structure that is shaped like a Möbius strip. “They expressed their ideas and unveiled their messages to the people of Kazakhstan. There are some valuable thoughts that we have to keep in mind. We are open to our society.” In Semey, a university city near the border with Siberia, students showed up in large numbers in a snowstorm on Sunday morning, and poll workers said there were already lines when they opened the doors at 7 a.m. Tolebay K. Rakhypbekov, rector of the Semey State Medical University, said political competition would come to Kazakhstan — but only gradually. “There is none now,” he said. “But what competition can there be against our president? We all love him.” Lyudmila A. Lyapunova, 60, said voters were there because they risked losing their jobs or university spots if they did not show up. As a retiree, she said, she could afford to openly denounce the process, and planned to cross out every name on the ballot: an improvised version of “against all,” a traditional option that was omitted from this year’s poll. But virtually all voters said they were casting ballots for the president. Ada G. Komanova, 76, raved over the services provided to the elderly through the Nazarbayev Fund: a health clinic, concerts, a senior center “so cozy, it’s like a fairy tale.” Kanat, a construction worker who would not give his last name, said he had voted for Mr. Nazarbayev, even though he thought the president and his family had enriched themselves fabulously over the last two decades. “They already have everything they need,” he said. “They can afford to think about the public.” Summary:","completion":"Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev appears to have secured re-election as President after a swift campaign season in the country.

He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which particle would have lower temperature, particle A or particle B? Hint: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Particle B would have a lower temperature. This is because temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, resulting in a lower temperature.

Follow the instructions on the package to bake the cake. You can also set aside a little of the batter to make one cupcake to represent the nucleus. Let the cake cool completely and then remove it from the pan. Place it on the cake board. You can also make 2 9 in (23 cm) cakes to layer on top of each other if you'd prefer a taller cell model. Dye the vanilla icing with the food dye, based on the color(s) you'd like to use to represent the cell components. One option is to make separate colored icings to represent the different layers of the cell. For example, to make an animal cell, you could use yellow icing to represent the cytoplasm and red icing on the cupcake representing the nucleus. If you are making a plant cell, you can make colored icing to distinguish the cell wall and spread it on the sides of the cake. It may be helpful to have a printout or image of the cell to identify the cell components as you place them on the cake. An example of good candies to use as components of an animal cell include: Pink Mike and Ikes for the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Blue Mike and Ikes for the mitochondria.
