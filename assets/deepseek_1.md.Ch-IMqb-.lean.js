Pinal County deputies arrested a San Tan Valley couple after their 2-year-old boy was found abandoned outside his residence in the 700 block of E. Payton Street. The parents, Brent Daley, 27, and Brianne Daley, 25 were arrested for child endangerment and child neglect after they left the child home alone for up to 90 minutes. Both parents admitted they had left the child home alone to go play the Pokémon Smartphone game in nearby neighborhoods. Sheriff Paul Babeu said, “Our agency and many other law enforcement agencies have been warning people about personal safety while playing this interactive Smartphone game, but we never would have imagined that parents would abandon a child to play Pokémon Go. This goes beyond comprehension.” He went on to say, “The deputies found the child locked out of his home in 96 degree weather with no water while his parents were gone interacting with their Smartphone game.” Details: On July 28, at 10:30 p.m., a neighbor called the Pinal County 9-1-1 Communications Center reporting that she found a 2-year-old boy outside her neighbor’s house. She said that nobody was home and the child appeared to have been abandoned. Deputies arrived and found the child screaming and crying attempting to get into the residence. The child was barefoot with only a diaper and a T-shirt on. The child was red faced, sweaty, and dirty. Deputies found the house unlocked and searched inside for any adults. They found three dogs inside, but no people inside. They confirmed by family pictures that the child lived at the residence. Deputies found a phone number for someone they believed was the boy’s dad, Brent Daley. When they called and told him his child was found abandoned, he replied, “Whatever”, and hung up on the deputies. While deputies had been on the scene for almost an hour, the couple showed up at the house. They confirmed that they were the boy’s parents and said they left the boy sleeping while they went out to get gas in their car. The couple was arrested for child neglect and endangerment. Sheriff Babeu described the couple’s statements after they were arrested, saying, “The couple admitted they were away from the residence for up to 90 minutes playing the Pokémon Go Smartphone game. They said they were driving around San Tan Valley, stopping at parks and other places to interact with the game.” The couple was booked and held in custody at the PCSO Jail awaiting to see a judge for the felony charges. The state Department of Child Services took custody of the child.

Question: I read this background article the other day: The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35% of the world’s food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects. I am facing a new situation today: Two villages had many inhabitants practicing horticulture. People from Valley village grew flowers and used arthropodes and other insects for pollination and crop protection. Granite village used arthropods and snails, they cultivated them for food.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Are the French starting to realize that the US makes great wine? Araujo Estate Wines, in Calistoga, Calif., is a fabulous cult winery that produces about 2,000 cases of cabernet sauvignon annually. In July it was announced that it had been sold to the family of French businessman Francois Pinault through their Artemis Group holding company. This a huge deal. Why? Because the French are still so hesitant to admit the U.S. is making great wine. Even after the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, a.k.a. Judgment of Paris. (Watch Bottle Shock here if you don’t know what I’m talking about, to get a pretty good recap of what happened). In a nutshell, it was a wine competition organized in Paris on May 24, 1976 by Steven Spurrier, a British wine merchant. He gathered famous French judges and carried out two blind tastings: one of Chardonnays and another of reds (Bordeaux wines from France and Cabernet Sauvignon wines from California). And shocker! A California wine rated best in each category, which blew the minds of the French because the France was generally regarded as being the foremost producer of the world's best wines. Still, we didn’t get much respect. Then in 1979, came the famous Opus One -- the result of a wine collaboration between the Robert Mondavi’s son Timothy in Oakville, Calif. and Bordeaux's Château Mouton Rothschild winemaker Lucien Sionneau. But then there wasn’t much collaboration after that --until now. The Araujo Estate, founded 23 years ago, is one of Napa Valley’s elite Cabernet Sauvignon producers. The price of the sale to the Artemis Group purchase was not disclosed, but is likely to have been at least 300,000 per acre, says James Molesworth, senior editor at Wine Spectator magazine. The sale included the Eisele Vineyard, 38 acres of vines, the winery and existing stocks. The good news is that the current Araujo staff—including the winemaking team led by Françoise Peschon—will remain with the estate under its new ownership. So are the French starting to realize that not only do does the U.S. make great wine, but it's actually a much better place to do business? One reason why we haven't seen more sales like this is because buying and selling a winery has to pass a lot of rules in France, says Molesworth. He says that Francois Pinault had the cash flow to bypass those stringent rules, not everyone does. So will we see more of this? I say yes. Our wine is that good. What do you think? Cent’ Anni. Summary:","completion":"Araujo Estate Wines, a Californian winery, has been sold to the family of French businessman Francois Pinault through their Artemis Group holding company.

Question 2: Can I treat acne scars with petroleum jelly? How does it help? OPTIONS: -no; -yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. They are both inquiring about the effectiveness of petroleum jelly in treating acne scars and how to apply it. I will provide a detailed response to address both questions. Petroleum jelly, commonly known as Vaseline, is an occlusive moisturizer that can help keep your skin hydrated by forming a protective barrier that prevents water loss. However, it is important to note that petroleum jelly does not contain any active ingredients that specifically target or treat acne scars. That being said, there are indirect ways in which petroleum jelly may help improve the appearance of acne scars. By providing adequate moisture to the skin, you can promote a healthy environment for cell regeneration and wound healing, which could potentially help improve the overall look and texture of scars. Additionally, preventing your skin from becoming excessively dry can minimize the risk of further irritation and the formation of new acne, allowing your existing scars to heal and fade over time. To apply petroleum jelly to acne scars, follow these steps: 1. Cleanse your face: Ensure your skin is clean and free of any dirt or oils by washing with a gentle cleanser. 2. Pat your skin dry: Gently pat your skin with a clean towel to remove excess water. 3. Apply treatment: If you are using any acne treatments or scar-specific serums, apply them first and allow them to absorb into your skin. 4. Apply petroleum jelly: Using clean fingers or a cotton swab, apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly directly onto the acne scar or any dry areas. Be cautious not to apply too much, as this could make your skin greasy and potentially clog pores, leading to new breakouts. 5. Apply a moisturizer and/or sunscreen: Continue your skincare routine by applying a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer and/or sunscreen. This will help lock in hydration and protect your skin from UV-damage, which can worsen the appearance of acne scars. While petroleum jelly may indirectly help with the appearance of acne scars, it is essential to note that there are more effective treatments specifically designed to target and treat scars. These treatments include products containing ingredients such as glycolic acid, salicylic acid, or retinoids. Some people may also find success with professional treatments, such as chemical peels, microdermabrasion, or laser therapy. It is recommended to consult with a dermatologist for the best treatment options tailored to your specific skin type and acne scarring concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The other female pachyderms are charmed by the little baby, until he sneezes, revealing that he has a pair of oversized ears. Their words take on a different tune as they make fun of the little baby, giving him the ridiculing name of Dumbo. Dumbo's Mother just ignores their taunts and still cares for her child.At the circus' first venue, the elephants are put on exhibition for a number of people. However, one young boy makes fun of Dumbo, and also ends up pulling on his ears. This causes Mrs Jumbo to protect her son, but her actions cause the Ringmaster and the other circus people to claim her to be a mad elephant, and she is locked away.After this incident, none of the other elephants show any compassion or want to help Dumbo after his Mother is taken away. The only one who comes to his aid in friendship is a little mouse named Timothy. Dumbo is at first scared of Timothy (as he is a mouse), but Timothy's words of wanting to help get Dumbo's Mother released makes him realize the little mouse also means well. Timothy feels that Dumbo just needs to prove himself, and while the Ringmaster is asleep, whispers the idea for an elaborate performance by the elephants.The elephants climb on top of each other, and the plan is for Dumbo to be launched to the top, holding a little flag. However, Dumbo trips over his ears, and ends up toppling the stacked elephants, which causes the circus tent to collapse.After this, Dumbo is given the rather embarrassing role of being painted as a clown, and put into a rather degrading circus act. Dumbo just feels even worse, but Timothy manages to take him to see his Mother, which cheers him up a little. Later on in the evening, Dumbo develops the hiccups, and Timothy finds a tub of water in the clown's tent.

Information: - Edmond Gareginovich Keosayan (9 October 1936 21 April 1994) was an Armenian Soviet film director and musician. - Mosfilm (\\"Mosfilm\\" ) is a film studio that is among the largest and oldest in the Russian Federation and in Europe. Its output includes most of the more widely acclaimed Soviet-era films, ranging from works by Andrei Tarkovsky and Sergei Eisenstein (commonly considered the greatest Soviet directors), to Red Westerns, to the Akira Kurosawa co-production \\"Dersu Uzala\\" (') and the epic \\"War and Peace\\" ('). - The Ostern (Eastern) or Red Western (also known as \\"Borscht Western\\") was the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries' take on the Western. The term refers to two related genres: - Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan. The two men would go on to collaborate on another 15 films. His wife Yko Yaguchi was also an actress in one of his films. - The Russian Civil War was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future. The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants. In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites. Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies. The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919. The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920. Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923. Armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934. There were an estimated 7,000,000-12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians. The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen. - The Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Neulovimye mstiteli\\") is a 1967 Soviet adventure film directed by Edmond Keosayan and made by Mosfilm. It is loosely based on the novel Little Red Devils by Pavel Blyakhin, under its original name. The film is an example of Ostern, set in Russian Civil War era Ukraine. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - The New Adventures of the Elusive Avengers ( Russian : , translit . Novye prikluchenya Neulovimykh ) is a 1968 Soviet action movie , a sequel of The Elusive Avengers , directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm . The movie was followed by The Crown of the Russian Empire , or Once Again the Elusive Avengers released in 1971 . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Crown of the Russian Empire, or Once Again the Elusive Avengers (translit. \\"Korona Rossiyskoy Imperii, ili Snova Neulovimye\\") is a 1971 Soviet action movie, a second sequel of \\"The Elusive Avengers\\", directed by Edmond Keosayan and made on Mosfilm.

Q:Information: - The Varsity Match is an annual rugby union fixture played between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge in England. The event began in 1872, with interruptions only for the two World Wars. Since 1921, the game has been played at Twickenham Stadium, London. It is normally played in early December. - The University of Oxford (informally Oxford University or simply Oxford) is a collegiate research university located in Oxford, England, United Kingdom. While having no known date of foundation, there is evidence of teaching as far back as 1096, making it the oldest university in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled northeast to Cambridge where they established what became the University of Cambridge. The two \\"ancient universities\\" are frequently jointly referred to as \\"Oxbridge\\". - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon. - The Oxford University Rugby Football Club ( Oxford University RFC or OURFC ) is the rugby union club of the University of Oxford . The club contests The Varsity Match every year against Cambridge University at Twickenham . - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. - Approximately 330 to 360 million people speak English as their first language. More than half of these (231 million) live in the United States, followed by some 55 million in England, the first place where English was spoken. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Cambridge is a university city and the county town of Cambridgeshire, England, on the River Cam about north of London. At the United Kingdom Census 2011, its population was 123,867, including 24,488 students. - Twickenham Stadium (usually known as Twickenham or Twickers) is a rugby union stadium in Twickenham, south west London, England. Owned by the governing body of rugby union in England, the Rugby Football Union (the RFU), the stadium hosts home test matches for the England national rugby union team. Other rugby union games played at the stadium include the Middlesex Sevens, the Aviva Premiership final, the LV Cup, the Varsity Match between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, and European Rugby Champions Cup matches. The RFU headquarters are based in the stadium. - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area. - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line. - Oxbridge is a portmanteau (blend word) of the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. The term is used to refer to them collectively in contrast to other British universities and more broadly to describe characteristics reminiscent of them, often with implications of superior social or intellectual status. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.

In November of 1948, Bob Corey is an American soldier badly wounded at the end of World War II, and undergoing a number of surgical operations on his spine at the Birmingham Veterans Hospital in Van Nuys, California. He is tended by a nurse, Julie Benson, and they have fallen in love. Corey's military pal, Steve Connolly, arrives in early November to discuss plans for the ranch in Scottsdale, Arizona, they plan to purchase and operate together once Corey is out of the hospital. The two men pool their G.I. benefits (totaling 40,000) to do so. Corey's final surgery is in mid-December, but Connolly does not appear at the hospital afterward to see his friend. By Christmas, Corey is still in recovery but Connolly still remains absent. One night, as Corey lies semi-conscious in bed after being administered a sleeping drug, a woman with a Swedish accent appears at his bedside. She says Connolly has been in a horrible accident; his spine is shattered and he wants to die, but she has refused to help him commit suicide. The woman asks Corey what to do, and he advises her to do nothing to harm Steve, and just to wait. Corey slips into unconsciousness, and the woman disappears.

Perhaps influenced by van Eyck's Madonna in the Church, Lochner closely detailed the fall and gradient of light. According to the art historian Brigitte Corley, the clothes of \\"protagonists change their hues in delicate reaction to the influx of light, reds being transformed through a symphony of pink tonalities to a dusty greyish white, greens to a warm pale yellow, and lemon shading through oranges to a saturated red\\". Lochner employed the notion of supernatural illumination not just from van Eyck, but also from von Soest's Crucifixion, where light emanating from Christ dissolves around John's red robe, as yellows rays eventually become white. There is a real possibility that a number of the faces of saints are modelled on historical persons, i.e. as donor portraits of the commissioners and their wives. Figures fitting this theory include St Ursula and St Gereon panels from the City Saints altarpiece.Unlike the painters in the Low Countries, Lochner was not so concerned with delineating perspective; his pictures are often set in shallow space, while his backgrounds give little indication of distance and often dissolve into solid gold. Thus, and given his harmonious colour schemes, Lochner is usually described as one of the last exponents of the International Gothic. This is not to say his paintings lack contemporary northern sophistication; his arrangements are often innovative. The worlds he paints are hushed, according to Snyder, achieved with the symmetry of subdued use of colour and the often repeated stylistic element of circles. Angels form circles around the heavenly figures; the heavenly figures' heads are highly circular and they wear round haloes. According to Snyder, the viewer is slowly \\"drawn into empathy with the revolving forms\\".Because of the paucity of surviving attributed works, it is difficult to detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of...

The bipolar junction transistor, the first type of transistor to be mass-produced, is a combination of two junction diodes, and is formed of either a thin layer of p-type semiconductor sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors (an n–p–n transistor), or a thin layer of n-type semiconductor sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors (a p–n–p transistor).

Choices: - purring - four paws - four legs - two eyes - whiskers The rationale to choose \\"whiskers\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Whiskers are the most likely choice to cause a tickling sensation when interacting with cats due to their unique structure, function, and sensitivity. Here is a detailed explanation of the rationale behind choosing \\"whiskers\\" as the answer: 1. Whiskers are specialized hairs: Whiskers, also known as vibrissae, are long, thick, and flexible hairs that protrude from the cat's upper lip, cheeks, and eyebrow area. They are stiffer than the regular fur and have a unique structure, which makes them ideal to create a tickling sensation on human skin. 2. Sensitivity: Whiskers are highly sensitive tactile organs, as each whisker is connected to a bundle of nerves within the cat's face, enabling them to gather a wealth of information about their surroundings. They can detect even the slightest changes in air currents, which in turn helps them navigate their environment. This sensitivity to touch and air movement makes whiskers more likely to be the cause of the tickling sensation. 3. Function: The primary function of a cat's whiskers is to serve as a tactile sensory aid. They use them as a type of \\"antenna\\" to help sense objects, judge distances, and determine if they can squeeze through tight spaces. When a cat is interacting with you, they may brush their whiskers against your skin, which could tickle you due to the flexibility and sensitivity of these hairs. 4. Comparison with other choices: - Purring: While purring can create vibrations that might be soothing or provide a sense of comfort, it is not likely to cause a tickling sensation. Purring is a vocalization and does not involve any physical touch. - Four paws or four legs: While cats' paws and legs can be furry and have a gentle touch, they are not specialized structures meant to provide any sensory functions, making them less likely to cause a tickling sensation compared to whiskers. - Two eyes: A cat's eyes serve primarily for vision and are not responsible for any tactile sensations. Therefore, it makes no sense to consider eyes as the cause of the tickling sensation. In conclusion, considering the unique structure, sensitivity, and function of a cat's whiskers, it is most likely that whiskers are responsible for the tickling sensation you feel when interacting with cats. None of the other choices provided have the tactile properties that would create this sensation. So, \\"whiskers\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

You have an equation that looks like this: 0 = -4157*j - 16584 - 12515. We need to find the value of \\"j\\" that makes the equation true. First, let's add 16584 and 12515 together.

Now, to find the value of \\"j,\\" we need to divide both sides by -4157: j = -29099 / -4157. Finally, let's do the division: 29099 divided by 4157 is approximately 6.999.

Given the background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now. If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam, or the manner in which those who returned were treated, then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost. Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves, and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world, as the saying goes. First Blood Part II, on the other hand, is little more than a fist-pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be, both in victory and defeat. Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando, while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient. Where it all comes undone is in the script, which didn't do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris. What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone, as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambo's massive chest. The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood. The film, that is - the novel didn't allow for the possibility of sequels. In this mediocre follow-up, Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open-air mine. As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat, a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman, who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission. Rambo, never one to back down from a hard day's violent work, accepts, and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand (I forget which). From there, he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held, and photograph them. His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release. Rambo being Rambo, however, has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications. Of course, things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambo's work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found. It is the age-old conspiracy theory, and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for. Of course, with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s, they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians. Together, the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo, but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets, arrows, rockets, and destruction. About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail-like chalice and declares himself invincible. To be honest, First Blood Part II is a well-photographed, and well-choreographed, action spectacle. The hand-to-hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever. The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to. Fortunately, this fad of America über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds. Some of the kills shown here are quite creative, despite all the problems. The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy. The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous. Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter. Sure, there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact, but never this ridiculous before. I gave Rambo: First Blood Part II a one out of ten. It is so bad it is ridiculous, and so ridiculous that it is often funny. One doesn't even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are.

Answer the following question: Information: - Cantopop (a contraction of \\"Cantonese pop music\\") or HK-pop (short for \\"Hong Kong pop music\\") is a genre of Cantonese music made primarily in Hong Kong, and also used to refer to the cultural context of its production and consumption. Originating in the 1970s, Cantopop reached its height of popularity in the 1980s and 1990s before its slow decline in the 2000s. The term \\"Cantopop\\" itself was coined in 1978 after \\"Cantorock\\", a term first used in 1974. During its height, Cantopop had spread to China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. - Smile is the sixth album by Fiona ( Chinese : ) , and was released on December 19 , 2008 . This is the first Cantopop album since Electric Angel two years earlier . - South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a sovereign state in East Asia, constituting the southern part of the Korean Peninsula. - Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, and often referred to as the \\"Lion City\\" or the \\"Little Red Dot\\", is a sovereign city-state in Southeast Asia, and the world's only island city-state. It lies one degree (137 km) north of the equator, south of the southernmost tip of continental Asia and peninsular Malaysia, with Indonesia's Riau Islands to the south. Singapore's territory consists of a diamond-shaped main island along with 62 other islets. Since independence, extensive land reclamation has increased its total size by 23% (130 km), and its greening policy has covered the densely populated island with tropical flora, parks and gardens. - Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory. - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

The Canada 2011 Census is a detailed enumeration of the Canadian population on May 10, 2011. Statistics Canada, an agency of the Canadian government, conducts a nationwide census every five years. In 2011, it consisted of a mandatory short form census questionnaire and an inaugural National Household Survey (NHS), a voluntary survey which replaced the mandatory long form census questionnaire; this substitution was the focus of much controversy. Completion of the (short form) census is mandatory for all Canadians, and those who do not complete it may face penalties ranging from fines to prison sentences. The Statistics Act mandates a Senate and/or House of Commons (joint) committee review of the opt-in clause (for the release of one's census records after 92 years) by 2014. The 2011 Census is the fifteenth decennial census and is required by section 8 of the \\"Constitution Act, 1867\\". As with other decennial censuses, the data was used to adjust federal electoral district boundaries. As of August 24, 2011, Canada's overall collection response rate was 98.1%, up over a percentage point from 96.5% in the 2006 Census.

To understand the translation, let's break down each word: 1. \\"Heistä\\" translates to \\"They\\" in English. In the Finnish language, pronouns are commonly used in the beginning of the sentences. 2. \\"Tulee\\" is a form of the verb \\"Tulla\\" used in Finnish which means \\"to come\\" or \\"to become\\". In the sentence, it is used as \\"become\\". 3. \\"Valmistelukunnan\\" is a compound term consisting of \\"valmistelu\\" which means \\"preparation\\" or \\"preparatory\\", and \\"kunnan\\" which is the genitive form of \\"kunta\\", means \\"committee\\". When combined, it translates to \\"of the preparatory committee\\". Finnish language often combines words to form longer compound words that contain more specific meanings. 4. \\"Jäseniä\\" is the partitive plural form of \\"jäsen\\", which means \\"member\\". The partitive case in Finnish is used to express partialness, here, it is used to indicate unspecified number of members, thus, translated as \\"members\\". Overall, \\"Heistä tulee valmistelukunnan jäseniä\\" directly translates to \\"They become members of the preparatory committee\\" in English. It implies that some people are joining a committee that is tasked with preparing for something, although without more context, we can't say what that something is.

Article:","completion":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Removing Mirror Shine for a Weathered Look Introduction Mirror shine can make a surface appear polished, pristine, and high-gloss. However, sometimes a more weathered, dull, and textured appearance is desirable for certain projects, whether it be for aesthetic purposes or to create a vintage effect. Fortunately, there is a simple and effective process for removing mirror shine using common household products. In this article, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of transforming a mirror-shining surface to achieve a weathered look. Step One: Wax Stripping The first step in removing a mirror shine is to use a wax stripping product, which is specifically designed for dissolving and lifting wax from surfaces. Wax stripping products can be easily found at most home improvement or automotive stores and are available in spray or liquid forms. Using a wax stripper is essential to break down the layers of wax that produce the mirror shine, ensuring a successful transformation to a weathered look. 1. Apply the wax stripping product: Follow the instructions on the packaging to apply the wax stripper to your surface. Most wax stripping products will need to be applied generously to ensure the entire surface is covered. 2. Allow it to soak: Give the wax stripper time to soak into the surface and break down the wax for effective removal. The recommended soaking time will typically be specified on the product packaging. 3. Remove the wax: After the indicated soaking time, use a clean cloth or sponge to wipe away the wax stripper, taking care not to scratch the surface. You should start to see the mirror shine diminishing. Step Two: Rubbing Alcohol The next step in achieving a dull, weathered appearance is to spray the surface with rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol). Rubbing alcohol acts as a degreaser and aids in removing any remaining wax residue, further dulling the surface. 1. Spray rubbing alcohol: Lightly mist the surface with rubbing alcohol, making sure to cover the entire area evenly. 2. Allow it to sit: Give the rubbing alcohol time to work on the surface, usually about 2-5 minutes will be sufficient. 3. Wipe clean: Using another clean cloth or sponge, wipe the rubbing alcohol away from the surface. The surface should have a more dulled, weathered appearance by this point. Step Three: Acetone Nail Polish Remover The final step for removing color and shine is to apply acetone nail polish remover. Acetone is a powerful solvent that will help dissolve any remaining shine-inducing elements and can also remove color from the surface. 1. Apply acetone nail polish remover: Soak a clean cloth or sponge with the acetone nail polish remover and apply it gently to the surface. 2. Let it work: Give the acetone some time to work on the surface and start dissolving any remaining shine and color. Usually, a few minutes should suffice. 3. Remove acetone: Finally, use a clean, dry cloth to wipe away the acetone nail polish remover. Conclusion By following this three-step process, you can easily and effectively remove a mirror shine from a surface and achieve a dull, weathered appearance. The use of wax stripping products, rubbing alcohol, and acetone nail polish remover ensures that your surface will be transformed with minimal effort and without damaging the underlying material."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: I haven't finish this book, but one thing I can tell you, it's very, very good, I'm not an expert in the field of COM+ and for this matter I'm telling you this, it's very clear and explicit, I'm not sure if it's complete, but it's some of the best books I've read and to read it's some of my few entertainments I read a book like this in about a month or less, 10 days if I'm on pressure, if you're not an expert like me, buy this one you won't regret it.

Write some highlights for the following article: There is no basic human right to barge into a church to make a political statement, jump around near the altar, and shout obscenities. But there is most certainly the right not to lose your liberty for doing so, even if the act is offensive. But that is exactly what happened Friday. A court in Moscow sentenced the three members of the feminist punk band Pussy Riot to two years in prison. In my two decades monitoring human rights in Russia I've never seen anything like the Pussy Riot case -- the media attention, the outpouring of public support, the celebrity statements for the detained and criminally charged punk band members. The image of three young women facing down an inexorable system of unfair justice and an oppressive state has crystallized for many in the West what is wrong with human rights in Russia. To be sure, it is deeply troubling. For me, even more shocking were the images of Stanislav Markelov, a human rights lawyer, lying on the sidewalk with the back of his head blown off in 2009, or the body of tax lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in prison in 2009 after he blew the whistle on a massive government extortion scheme. The Pussy Riot case shines a much needed, if highly disturbing, spotlight on the issue of freedom of expression in post-Soviet Russia. On February 21, four members of the group performed what they call a \\"punk prayer\\" in Moscow's Russian Orthodox Christ the Savior Cathedral. They danced around and shouted some words to their song, \\"Virgin Mary, Get Putin Out.\\" The stunt lasted less than a minute before the women were forcibly removed. The same day, a video widely shared on social media showed a montage of the stunt with the song spliced in. The song criticizes the Russian Orthodox Church's alleged close relationship with the Kremlin and the personally close relationship of President Vladimir V. Putin with the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Three of the band members were tried on criminal \\"hooliganism\\" charges. Their trial was theater of the absurd. In their closing statements, the women and their lawyers delivered devastating critiques of the state of justice and civic freedoms in Russia. During the Soviet era, the human rights landscape in Russia was stark. But since then the situation has been harder to figure out, often making it easier for outsiders simply to give the government a pass. But the devil is in the details. It has been incredibly difficult to pin down any involvement of officials in the beatings and murders of investigative journalists and human rights activists. And the government, while not silencing civil society groups outright, tries to marginalize, discredit, and humiliate them, and crush them with heavy-handed bureaucracy, trumped-up accusations, threats and the like. Whatever misdemeanor the three women incurred for their antics in the church should not have been transformed by the authorities into a criminal offense that in effect punishes them for their speech. It's typical, though, of how the authorities try to keep a lid on controversial issues. The Russian think tank SOVA has documented dozens of cases in recent years in which the authorities used the threat of extremism charges to silence critics. This also isn't the first time Russian authorities have misused criminal legislation to stifle critical artistic expression. In 2010 a Moscow district court found the co-organizers of a controversial art exhibit guilty of the vague charge of \\"inciting religious hatred.\\" The art exhibit organizers were fined. By making the Pussy Riot band members await trial in jail for almost six months, the authorities made clear how they plan to set boundaries for political criticism. After a winter of unprecedented, peaceful opposition protests, a dozen demonstrators whom the authorities claim were involved in a scuffle with police during a mass demonstration in May have been arrested and are being charged with crimes grossly disproportionate to their alleged actions. Police have searched opposition leaders' homes. Laws rammed through Russia's parliament this summer sent more signals: criminal liability for leaders of nongovernmental organizations for \\"serious breaches\\" of new restrictive regulations; much tougher sanctions for violating rules on public assembly; and new restrictions on the Internet that could easily shut down big social networking sites. Critics of the Kremlin have been subject to vicious harassment, intimidation and grotesque public smear campaigns. For years Russian human rights defenders have tried to draw attention to the lack of independence of the courts. With the unprecedented attention to the Pussy Riot trial, the surreal state of justice when political interests are at stake is there for all to see. What we really should be wondering isn't why Pussy Riot is so distinctive, but whether it's just the tip of the iceberg. Too often, foreign governments have resorted to wishful thinking about the direction Russia is heading. Talking about human rights at a high level -- where all things in Russia are decided -- is unpleasant business. It might be hard, but Russia won't respect other governments if they shy away. If three women in the defendants' cage had the courage to speak out about where Russia is headed, surely members of the international community should too. They, at least, won't be thrown in jail. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rachel Denber. Highlights:","completion":"1. Three members of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot were sentenced to two years in prison on Friday in Moscow for conducting what they called a \\"punk prayer\\" in a cathedral, an act seen as a form of protest against the close relationship between the Church and the Kremlin. 2. The case has attracted significant media attention and large public support and has become symbolic of the human rights situation in Russia, particularly regarding freedom of speech. 3. The band deliberately made a political statement against President Putin's relationship with the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church. Their trial, in which they faced \\"hooliganism\\" charges, was dubbed a \\"theatre of the absurd\\" with stark criticism by the band and their lawyers on the state of justice and civic freedoms in Russia. 4. The author, Rachel Denber, argues that the authorities have tried to suppress those who openly criticize the regime by using legal means. Previous cases where legislation has been used to stifle critical expression include labeling artwork inciting religious hatred and prosecuting opposition protestors for crimes disproportionate to their actions. 5. Denber asserts that the case should not be an isolated incident but rather seen as the tip of the iceberg in Russia's handling of domestic dissent. She calls on the international community to speak out and not succumb to wishful thinking regarding improvements in the human rights situation. 6. The Russian authorities' tactics include marginalization, discreditation, humiliation, and bureaucratic measures in an attempt to quash civil society groups and independent thought. 7. In recent years, various laws have also been introduced to limit freedoms, including criminal liability for breaches of new restrictive regulations on non-governmental organizations, tougher sanctions for public assembly infringements, and new internet restrictions potentially targeting social networking sites. These developments continue to threaten freedom of expression and political criticism in Russia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Hypothesis: Charitable scalawags shared their booty with folks in the Balearics. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise and the hypothesis appear to be unrelated; thus, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. To better understand this, let's analyze the two statements in detail. Premise: Burgeoning trade in the Balearics was interrupted by marauding pirates based in North Africa as well as by the powerful Turkish fleet. In this premise, we have three primary components: trade in the Balearics, North African pirates, and the Turkish fleet. The focus of the premise is on the interruption of trade, which was adversely affected by both the pirate activities and the Turkish fleet. The premise provides information about the negative impact of these external threats to the trade and economy in the Balearics. Hypothesis: Charitable scalawags shared their booty with folks in the Balearics. The hypothesis introduces the notion of charitable scalawags, pirates or criminals who are assumed to share their stolen goods with the local population in the Balearics. This statement does not provide any direct information about the source of the booty, that is whether the stolen goods were a result of the marauding activities of North African pirates or the Turkish fleet. Therefore, the connection between the premise and the hypothesis remains unclear. The premise does not support or entail the hypothesis since it does not provide any direct evidence or logical connection that would lead us to assume that charitable scalawags were sharing their stolen goods with the people in the Balearics. The hypothesis is an independent idea with no discernable ties to the premise. Both statements provide tidbits of information about the Balearics, but the premise does not contain sufficient information or logical premises to conclude that the hypothesis is a result of the initial premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, let's move 4 * u from the right side to the left side by subtracting it. 11 * u - 4 * u - 35 = 0 3. Now let's combine the \\"u\\" terms: (11 - 4) * u - 35 = 0 7 * u - 35 = 0 4. Next, we will move 35 to the right side by adding it to both sides: 7 * u = 35 5. Finally, we need to find the value of \\"u\\". To do that, let's divide both sides by 7: u = 35 / 7 So, u is equal to 5.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Determine the sentiment: \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" is odd and disturbing, yet being so clever and intelligent at the same time. It cleverly jumps between future and the past, and the story it tells is about a man named James Cole, a convict, who is sent back to the past to gather information about a man-made virus that wiped out 5 billion of the human population on the planet back in 1996. At first Cole is sent back to the year 1990 by accident and by misfortune he is taken to a mental institution where he tries to explain his purpose and where he meets a psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who tries to help him and a patient named Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist. Being provocative and somehow so sensible, dealing with and between reason and madness, the movie is a definite masterpiece in the history of science-fiction films. The story is just fantastic. It's so original and so entertaining. The screenplay itself written by David and Janet Peoples is inspired by a movie named \\"La Jetée\\" (1962) which I haven't seen, but I must thank the director and writer of the movie, Chris Marker, for giving such an inspiration for the writers of \\"Twelve Monkeys\\". I read a little about \\"La Jetée\\", it's not the same story but it has the same idea, so this is not just a copy of it. David and Janet Peoples have transformed this great deal of inspiration to a modernized story, which tells about this urgent need for people to find a solution for maintaining human existence and it does it in a so beautiful and a realistic way that it's a guaranteed thrill ride from the beginning till the end. The music used in the film is odd and somehow so funny and amusing it doesn't really fit until you really get it and when you do you realise that it's so compelling, composed by Paul Buckmaster. Terry Gilliam, who we remember from Monty Python, as the director of the movie was a real surprise for me, as I really never thought him as a director type of a person. I know he has directed movies before, but I really couldn't believe that he could make something this magnificent. It shouldn't be a surprise though, as he does an amazing job. You can still sense that same weirdness as in the Python's, but for me the directing is pretty much flawless though in its odd way of describing things it also makes some scenes strangely disturbing. Yes, it is indeed odd, weird, bizarre and disturbing, so it also makes the movie a bit heavy too, so the weak minded viewers will probably find it hard to watch the movie all the way through. It's not as heavy as you could imagine, but it just has these certain things which in their own purpose are sometimes pretty severe to watch. Despite that, the movie holds this pure intelligence inside it and through flashbacks, dreams, jumps between the past and the future it mixes up the whole story in a very clever way and it doesn't even make the plot messy in any part, though it does need concentration from the viewer after all. What comes to acting, well the movie doesn't even go wrong there. The role of James Cole is played by the mighty Bruce Willis, who probably does his best role performance yet to date. Now people may disagree with me, as he did some fine job in for example \\"The Sixth Sense\\" as well, but for me the role of James Cole was so ideal for Willis and he performs it incredibly well. The character is very well written too, yet performed even better. Cole starts to question his own existence and he deals with himself, starting to question his actual time of living, trying to survive and find the crucial missing piece of the puzzle. By hardship he starts to loose his faith, questioning if he can even trust or believe himself. Other role performances worth mentioning are the performances of Madeleine Stow and Brad Pitt. Stow plays the role of Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist of James Cole, who sees something strangely familiar in Cole and decides to help him to deal with his madness. She somehow starts to believe Cole's story but as a believer of science she tries to find solutions through it and tries to deal with reason when it comes to unbelievable things. Brad Pitt is so good in the role of Jeffrey Goines and he also does one of his best role performances yet to date. The insane yet hilarious personality of the character brought Pitt even an Oscar nomination for it, so I guess I'm not praising the honestly fabulous performance for nothing. All in all, \\"Twelve Monkeys\\" is a great science-fiction experience and it will surely be a recommendation for everyone, especially for the sci-fi fans. It includes brilliant characters and superb role performances, especially from Willis and Pitt, and an original and an entertaining story which forms a plot that's so intelligent and clever. Yet being that already mentioned weird and disturbing it definitely captures the viewer's attention by making it interesting and witty. It's also an explosive thriller and it has romance in it too, so it's all that in same package and that makes it one of the best sci-fi motion pictures I've ever seen. Through the odd yet terrific vision of Terry Gilliam it manages to keep itself in balance despite the somewhat bumpy yet somehow stable ride. Hard to explain really, but that's how it is, it's mind blowing.","completion":"The sentiment of this text is predominantly positive.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Question: What state was Burton playing college ball in when he was drafted? Passage 1:The Oakland Athletics selected Burton out of Western Carolina University in the eighth round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He lost his remaining eligibility at Western Carolina by signing with Oakland on June 12, 2002. The A's sent him to their Single-A affiliate, the Vancouver Canadians. With Vancouver he had a 0–4 win–loss record with a 3.58 earned run average (ERA) in 13 games. He followed up his 2002 season with 15 appearances for the Kane County Cougars in 2003. With Kane County he improved both his win–loss ratio to a 2–1 and his ERA to 2.27. The 2004 season was less consistent for Burton, splitting time between two of the Athletics farm teams, the Arizona League Athletics (AZL Athletics) (Rookie League) and the Modesto A's (Single-A). Burton had a 1–0 record and a 4.16 ERA with the AZL Athletics. While in Modesto he had a 3–2 win–loss ratio and a 4.78 ERA. Overall, Burton pitched a combined 53.2 innings in 15 games in 2004. Burton spent the 2005 season with the Stockton Ports, another Oakland Single-A affiliate and went 4–4 with a 2.60 ERA. The 2006 season would turn out to be Burton's final year in Oakland's farm system, and Burton spent it with the Midland RockHounds. With the RockHounds he had a 6–5 record and a 4.14 ERA in a then career high 53 appearances. Passage 2:The right to marry a person of a different race was addressed in Loving v. Virginia, in which the Court said, in 1967, that its decision striking down anti-miscegenation laws could be justified either by substantive due process, or by the Equal Protection Clause. The unconstitutionality of bans on and refusals to recognize same-sex marriage was decided partly on substantive due process grounds by Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015. A right to have children was addressed in Skinner v. Oklahoma, but the Court in Skinner, in 1942, explicitly declined to base its decision on due process but instead cited the Equal Protection Clause since the Oklahoma law required sterilization of some three-time felons but not others. A substantive due process right of a parent to educate a young child (before ninth grade) in a foreign language was recognized in Meyer v. Nebraska, in 1923, with two justices dissenting, and Justice Kennedy has mentioned that Meyer might be decided on different grounds in modern times. Laws that \\"shock the conscience\\" of the Court were generally deemed unconstitutional, in 1952, in Rochin v. California, but in concurring, Justices Black and Douglas argued that pumping a defendant's stomach for evidence should have been deemed unconstitutional on the narrower ground that it violates the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination. The Court, in O'Connor v. Donaldson, in 1975, said that due process is violated by confining a nondangerous mentally ill person who is capable of surviving safely in freedom. Chief Justice Burger's concurring opinion was that such confinement may also amount to \\"punishment\\" for being mentally ill, violating the Court's interpretation of the Eighth Amendment in Robinson v. California. Freedom from excessive punitive damages was deemed to be a due process right in BMW v. Gore, in 1996, but four justices disagreed. The Court, in Cruzan v. Missouri, decided, in 1990, that due process is not violated if a state applies \\"a clear and convincing evidence standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state\\". Passage 3:The time from roughly 15,000 to 5,000 BC was a time of transition, and swift and extensive environmental change, as the planet was moving from an Ice age, towards an interstadial (warm period). Sea levels rose dramatically (and are continuing to do so), land that was depressed by glaciers began lifting up again, forests and deserts expanded, and the climate gradually became more modern. In the process of warming up, the planet saw several \\"cold snaps\\" and \\"warm snaps\\", such as the Older Dryas and the Holocene climatic optimum, as well as heavier precipitation. In addition, the Pleistocene megafauna became extinct due to environmental and evolutionary pressures from the changing climate. This marked the end of the Quaternary extinction event, which was continued into the modern era by humans. The time around 11,700 years ago (9700 BC) is widely considered to be the end of the old age (Pleistocene, Paleolithic, Stone age, Wisconsin Ice Age), and the beginning of the modern world as we know it.","completion":"The task is asking you to determine which passage contains information about the state where Burton played college ball when he was drafted.

I'm going to explain the differences to you between car struts and car shocks, and about the car alarm and battery. Let's go! 1. Car struts and car shocks: Imagine that cars are like big toy cars. When they run on the roads, they go on bumps andholes. Car struts and car shocks help make the ride feel smooth. Car struts and car shocks may look similar, but they have differences: - Car struts: They're like strong legs that hold the car up and help it bounce less when it goes over bumps. Struts also help the car wheels stay in place and turn when you steer. - Car shocks: They work like special springs that help the car bounce less too, but they don't help with holding the car up or turning the wheels. They just make the ride smoother. 2. Car alarm and battery: A car alarm is like a little guard that makes loud noises when it thinks someone might be trying to take your toy car without permission. When the alarm goes off, it uses energy from the car's battery. If the alarm keeps going off for a long time, it's like using lots of energy from your toy's battery to make the loud noises. So, yes, a car alarm going off for too long can drain your battery, which means your toy car might not work until you put more energy back into the battery. Now, are these questions the same? Nope! They are different because one asks about car struts and shocks (how cars stay smooth on bumpy roads), and the other asks about car alarms and batteries (how an alarm can make your car's battery lose energy).

Use a 2 quart (2 liter) plastic bottle and fill it ¾ of the way with water. You can either use water from a local pond or stream, or from the tap. Pond or stream water is preferable because you will also get small microorganisms that may be present in the water. If you have to use tap water, make sure that you let it sit in an open container for at least 24 hours before using in your ecosystem. The chlorine present in tap water may kill any animal or plant species that you add to your ecosystem. Letting the water sit for 24 hours gives the chlorine time to dissipate from the water. Next, add 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) of tiny rocks or pebbles. You should always wash any rocks prior to adding them to your ecosystem. This will help remove any contaminants. At this stage you could also add one dead leaf. This will provide a food source for any microorganisms in the water. You can buy aquatic plants from your local pet supply store. When you add the plants to your ecosystem, make sure to separate them and add them individually. Alternatively, you could pick water plants from a local pond. You can also purchase small freshwater snails at your local pet supply store. Alternatively, you may be able to find water snails from a local pond.

Movie title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Context: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogoro shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited.

Although most hardware clones were not produced under license by Nintendo, certain companies were granted licenses to produce NES-compatible devices. The Sharp Corporation produced at least two such clones: the Twin Famicom and the SHARP 19SC111 television. The Twin Famicom was compatible with both Famicom cartridges and Famicom Disk System disks. It was available in two colors (red and black) and used hardwired controllers (as did the original Famicom), but it featured a different case design.

Please answer the following question: This article: Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and... contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the person that painted the painting that the Royal Scottish Academy purchased?, what is it ?

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood.

By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform.

The equation we need to solve is: 20 * p - 128 = 163 + 169. First, let's add 163 and 169 together because it's easier to do that first. We get 332. Now our equation looks like this: 20 * p - 128 = 332. Now, we want to get \\"p\\" by itself, right? To do this, let's start with getting rid of that -128 by doing the opposite. The opposite of subtracting 128 is adding 128. So, let's add 128 to both sides of the equation! Now, our equation looks like this: 20 * p = 332 + 128. If we add 332 and 128, we get 460. So the equation now looks like this: 20 * p = 460. Now, we just have to get rid of that multiplication with 20. The opposite of multiplying by 20 is dividing by 20, right? So let's divide both sides of the equation by 20: p = 460 / 20. If we divide 460 by 20, we get 23! So, p = 23! Yay, we did it!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

[-] Yes; [-] No; The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the correct answer is \\"nephrons.\\" Nephrons are the functional units of the kidneys that play a crucial role in filtering blood. They maintain proper balance in the body by regulating water and solutes like sodium, potassium, and calcium. Additionally, nephrons remove harmful metabolic waste products from the blood, including urea and creatinine. Composed of a glomerulus and a tubule, nephrons receive blood that is rich in waste material from the renal artery. The glomerulus is a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries that filter the blood by allowing water, ions, and small molecules to pass through. This part of the nephron prevents larger components, such as blood cells and proteins, from filtering out. This filtration process results in a fluid called the glomerular filtrate, which then enters the renal tubule. The tubule works in three segments: the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), loop of Henle, and distal convoluted tubule (DCT). As the filtrate passes through these segments, the tubules selectively reabsorb nutrients, ions, and water to balance electrolyte levels, proper pH, and maintain osmoregulation in the body. The remaining waste material is then concentrated in the collecting ducts and forms urine, which is transported to the bladder for eventual excretion. Overall, nephrons are essential in the filtering and purification of blood, ensuring optimal body function by maintaining balance in the body's fluids and eliminating waste products."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The main subject is \\"auditors\\" and the action is \\"acknowledged.\\" Step 2: Identify the secondary subject and action. The secondary subject is again \\"auditors\\" and the action is \\"did not look at priests' personnel files.\\" This secondary action is what the main subject acknowledged. Sentence 2: The auditors, for example, did not have access to church personnel files. Step 1: Identify the main subject and action. The main subject is \\"The auditors\\" and the action is \\"did not have access.\\" Step 2: Identify additional context or information. \\"For example\\" provides context to the sentence, suggesting that there is more information related to the main idea. We can infer that the main idea is that the auditors were limited in their investigation, and not having access to church personnel files is one such limitation. Answer choice (a). no: The sentences are not exactly identical in meaning, but they share some similarities. Both sentences state that auditors did not examine priests' personnel files. However, sentence 1 emphasizes that the auditors acknowledged their lack of examination, while sentence 2 provides context by saying \\"for example\\" and focusing on the lack of access as a limitation. Answer choice (b). yes: While the sentences have a similar underlying concept (auditors not examining personnel files), their meaning is not completely identical, as explained in the breakdown above.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What institution was recommended by William Laver?, using the article: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895. Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he..., what would be the answer ?

Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies.

Some of these species have been placed with the great herons in Ardea , and conversely the large white species like great egret are occasionally allocated to Egretta . The fact that some of the group are named \`\` heron '' and some \`\` egret '' has no taxonomic significance . - Botaurus is a genus of bitterns, a group of wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae. The genus name \\"Botaurus\\" was given by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens, and is derived from Medieval Latin \\"butaurus\\", \\"bittern\\", itself constructed from the Middle English name for the Eurasian Bittern, \\"Botor\\". Pliny gave a fanciful derivation from \\"Bos\\" (ox) and \\"taurus\\" (bull), because the bittern's call resembles the bellowing of a bull. - The herons are the long-legged freshwater and coastal birds in the family Ardeidae, with 64 recognised species, some of which are referred to as \\"egrets\\" or \\"bitterns\\" rather than herons. Members of the genera \\"Botaurus\\" and \\"Ixobrychus\\" are referred to as \\"bitterns\\", and, together with the zigzag heron or zigzag bittern in the monotypic genus \\"Zebrilus\\", form a monophyletic group within the Ardeidae. Egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes. Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller.

His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for American Greetings in Cleveland, Ohio. He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company's Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career. In Cleveland he met a group of young bohemians such as Buzzy Linhart, Liz Johnston, and Harvey Pekar. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work. In 1965, cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman printed some of Crumb's work in the humor magazine he edited, Help!. Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but Help! ceased publication shortly after. Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for Topps before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings. Crumb married Dana Morgan in 1964. Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food. The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son Jesse (b. 1965). In 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of Fritz the Cat strips published in the men's magazine Cavalier. Fritz had appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s; he was to become a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969. Crumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking LSD, a psychedelic drug that was then still legal. He had both good and bad trips. One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: From the moment that an animal is born it has to make decisions. It has to decide which of the things around it are for eating, and which are to be avoided; when to attack and when to run away. The animal is, in fact, playing a complicated and potentially dangerous game with its environment, discomfort or destruction. This is a difficult and unpleasant business and few animals would survive if they had to start from the beginning and learn about the world wholly by trial and error, for there are too many possible decisions which would prove fatal. So we find, in practice, that the game is always arranged in favor of the young animal in one way or another. Either the animal is protected during the early stages of its learning about the world around it, or the knowledge of which way to respond is built into its nervous system from the start. The fact that animals behave sensibly can be attributed partly to what we might call genetic learning, to distinguish it from individual learning that an animal does in the cause of its own life time. Genetic learning is learning by a species as a whole, and it is achieved by selection of those members of each generation that happen to behave in the right way. However, genetic learning depends upon a prediction that the future will more or less exactly resemble the past. The more variable individual experience is likely to be, the less efficient is genetic learning as a means of getting over the problems of the survival game. It is not surprising to find that very few species indeed depend wholly upon genetic learning. In the great majority of animals, behavior is a compound of individual experience added to the action patterns animals are born with.That is why animals can survive. Question: Most animals survive because they can make right decisions by _ .

It is not possible to tell The phrase \\"It's a good thing compared to how things were before\\" suggests that the present situation or development is better than the past one. However, without additional information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that something being available before would lead to an improvement or positive change. The specific circumstances, the nature of the things being compared, and the implications of having the item or service available earlier need to be taken into consideration before forming a conclusion. It is possible that having something available earlier could have led to positive outcomes, or it could have produced negative or unintended consequences. Consequently, it is essential to analyze the context in which the question is asked and evaluate the potential impact of the change. For example, consider the availability of a new medicine. If the medication was available earlier, it might have saved many lives, but it could have also had adverse effects on the environment or led to antibiotic resistance. In such cases, it would not be appropriate to conclude that the medicine's earlier availability was necessarily good or bad without sufficient information and analysis.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Review: Reviewed at the Sept 12, 2006 2nd screening at the Paramount 1 theatre during the Toronto International Film Festival. The film had World Premiered the day before at the Elgin Theatre VISA Screening Room. The basic plot involves Morgan Freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the downward slope of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him, but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc. The downward slope is indicated by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain DVD bins and his being chauffeured by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops Freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager. He soon discovers the real-life market is run by a iron-willed \\"10 Items or Less\\" checkout line clerk played by Paz Vega. When Freeman's ride never returns and Vega needs help in prepping for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get Freeman back home and to get Vega a job that'll get her on a more upwardly mobile career path. While the film was enjoyable, it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress. There were two extended musical sequences (One with Vega & Freeman teaching each other children's songs in the car, one that literally plays like a Paul Simon music video) that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long. It's a good thing Morgan Freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little. Sure it was funny in parts and Paz Vega is a delight as well, but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film. They lost me when Morgan Freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and Paz Vega said she never does that. Who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no!? In the real world it's the exact opposite. Make sure you stay for the outtakes in the credits. The bit with a Target Store saleslady teaching Morgan Freeman how to hustle sales is just hilarious! An early bit where Freeman's chauffeur insists it is Freeman's voice on a \\"Books on Tape\\" reading was also pretty funny. The director/writer Brad Silberling and actress Paz Vega were there for a brief Q&A after the screening. Silberling answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for Morgan Freeman and that once Freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there. Quite a compliment for both Silberling's writing and also about how Freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it. Now, what is this review like? pick from the following. a). negative. b). positive.","completion":"This review is b). positive. The person who wrote the review enjoyed the film, found it funny in parts, and thought that both Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega did a good job.

Information: - In animal anatomy, the notochord is a flexible rod made out of a material similar to cartilage. If a species has a notochord, it is, by definition, a chordate. The notochord lies along the anteroposterior (\\"head to tail\\") axis, is usually closer to the dorsal than the ventral surface of the animal, and is composed of cells derived from the mesoderm. The notochord has been observed to have many functions including developmental functions. The most commonly cited functions are as a site of muscle attachment, vertebral precursor, and as a midline tissue that provides signals to the surrounding tissue during development. - In zoological nomenclature, a subphylum is a taxonomic rank below the rank of phylum. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The beak, bill, or rostrum is an external anatomical structure of birds that is used for eating and for grooming, manipulating objects, killing prey, fighting, probing for food, courtship and feeding young. The terms \\"beak\\" and \\"rostrum\\" are also used to refer to a similar mouth part in some dicynodonts, Ornithischians, cephalopods, cetaceans, billfishes, pufferfishes, turtles, Anuran tadpoles and sirens. - Snail is a common name that is applied most often to land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod molluscs. However, the common name \\"snail\\" is also applied to most of the members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have a coiled shell that is large enough for the animal to retract completely into. When the word \\"snail\\" is used in this most general sense, it includes not just land snails but also thousands of species of sea snails and freshwater snails. Occasionally a few other molluscs that are not actually gastropods, such as the Monoplacophora, which superficially resemble small limpets, may also informally be referred to as \\"snails\\". - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - Clam is the general common name of any mollusks within the class Bivalvia. More specifically, true clams are bivalves having two shells of equal size connected by two adductor muscles and having a powerful burrowing foot. They are infaunal, spending most of their lives partially buried in the sand of the ocean floor. These characteristics distinguish the true clams from other bivalves, such as oysters, mussels, and scallops. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A claw is a curved , pointed appendage , found at the end of a toe or finger in most amniotes ( mammals , reptiles , birds ) . However , the word \`\` claw '' is also often used in reference to an invertebrate . Somewhat similar fine hooked structures are found in arthropods such as beetles and spiders , at the end of the leg or tarsus for gripping a surface as the creature walks . Crabs ' , lobsters ' and scorpions ' pincers , or more formally , their \`\` chelae '' , are sometimes called claws . A true claw , ( as opposed to a chela ) is made of hard protein called keratin . Claws are used to catch and hold prey in carnivorous mammals such as cats and dogs , but may also be used for such purposes as digging , climbing trees , self - defense , and grooming , in those and other species . Similar appendages that are flat and do not come to a sharp point are called nails instead . Claw - like projections that do not form at the end of digits , but spring from other parts of the foot are properly named spurs . Claws of animals like tigers , lions , and bears were used in making items such as ornaments , pendants , and brooches . - Crabs are decapod crustaceans of the infraorder Brachyura, which typically have a very short projecting \\"tail\\" (abdomen) (= short, = tail), usually entirely hidden under the thorax. They live in all the world's oceans, in fresh water, and on land, are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton and have a single pair of claws. Many other animals with similar names such as hermit crabs, king crabs, porcelain crabs, horseshoe crabs, and crab lice are not true crabs. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped echinoderms belonging to the class Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly referred to as brittle stars or \\"basket stars\\". About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the intertidal zone down to abyssal depths, below the surface. - Worms are many different distantly related animals that typically have a long cylindrical tube-like body and no limbs. Worms vary in size from microscopic to over in length for marine polychaete worms (bristle worms), for the African giant earthworm, \\"Microchaetus\\", and for the marine nemertean worm (bootlace worm), \\"Lineus longissimus\\". Various types of worm occupy a small variety of parasitic niches, living inside the bodies of other animals. Free-living worm species do not live on land, but instead live in marine or freshwater environments, or underground by burrowing. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited.

English is the world language of politics and international business. It becomes the international language of science, medicine, sports, travel and so on. In most schools in Asia, English is taught as the main foreign language. School children in China and Japan begin to learn English at an early age. English is the official language of more than seventy-five countries including Britain, Canada, the United States and Australia. Many different languages are spoken in some countries. However, English is often used as an official language to help people communicate with each other. India is a good example. English is the common language in this country, but at least twenty-four languages are spoken there. Do you know the history of English? Old English took many words from the French language. Most English words came from French, especially those words used for describing the law and the government, such as \\"damage\\",\\" prison \\"and \\" marriage\\". Then, English became what language experts called Middle English. The history of English continues as Middle English, and then it becomes Modern English, and it is spoken today. ,.

A: Choose your answer from: (1). disruption (2). solution (3). fluid (4). suspension","completion":"A heterogeneous mixture of particles of one substance distributed throughout a second substance in a different phase is known as a suspension (4). Suspensions are mixtures that consist of solid particles or liquid droplets large enough to eventually settle under the influence of gravity, without undergoing any chemical changes. These mixtures are characterized by their heterogeneous nature, as the particles are not uniformly distributed in the second substance. The solid particles or liquid droplets in a suspension are generally larger than those in a solution or colloid, leading to their ability to settle over time. In contrast, a solution (2) is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances, where one substance, called the solute, dissolves into another substance, known as the solvent. In a solution, the solute and solvent mix together uniformly, forming a consistent mixture with particles at the molecular or ionic level, which cannot be separated by simple mechanical means such as filtration. As for the other options, disruption (1) and fluid (3) are not relevant to the question. Disruption refers to an interruption or disturbance in the normal functioning or continuity of an activity. Fluid is a term describing substances that flow, such as liquids and gases, rather than being a term to describe a heterogeneous mixture of particles.

Movie title: Mother and Son Context: \\"Mother and Son\\" (1997) is a love story, not of the \\"Romeo and Juliette\\" or \\"Tristan and Isolde\\" type, but rather regarding the profound emotional ties that exist between a mother and her son. The film calls for amazing optical effects and sounds in order to develop a cinematographic poetry. \\"Mother and Son\\" is the first part of a trilogy that has for its subject matter the study of the drama in human relationships. It is followed by \\"Father and Son\\" (2003), and by \\"Two Brothers and a Sister,\\" the final installment, which is in its preliminary filming stage.The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail, old woman. They recline in a silence penetrated only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted, sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey, from her sick-bed to her death-bed. It is a circular motion, which travels a long walk through a dream-like landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous ski of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the worldThey return to the house.

Older children may benefit from being introduced to the concept of neurodiversity and the disability rights movement. Encourage a child to see the good in an autistic friend, sibling, or classmate. For example, \\"Yes, Lola does have a hard time talking and dealing with big emotions sometimes. I've noticed that she's sweet, and good at art.

Echolocation is a step-by-step process, and disturbance to any part of it can impact the overall process. Echolocation works from the point the high-pitched tone is produced by the bat, bounced off an object, and returned to the bat. If anything disrupts this process, the bat’s ability to navigate or hunt for prey is compromised as the information required to determine the location, size, shape, and position of objects or prey is corrupted or incomplete. This is a direct impact on the process. It is possible that an external factor, such as a loud noise or other related interference, could disrupt the process by mingling with the original high-pitch sound or echo, therefore altering what the bat receives and interprets. This can be viewed as a direct impact because it explicitly interferes with a step in the echolocation process.

We have to subtract 144 from both sides! The equation now turns into: -24 - 144 = 21*x, or -168 = 21*x Now we need to find the value of x. For that, we need to divide both sides by 21, which will leave x by itself on the right side! So when we divide -168 by 21, we get -8. So, x = -8. So the solution to the equation is x = -8!

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person's eyes naturally focus images behind the retina? Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

The bulb contains a small amount of solid sodium or mercury as well as a mixture of neon and argon gases. When an electric current passes through the gases, it causes the solid sodium or mercury to change to a gas and emit visible light. Sodium vapor lights, like these streetlights, produce yellowish light. Mercury vapor lights produce bluish light. Vapor lights are very bright and energy efficient. The bulbs are also long lasting.

He realizes that he's never seen someone changing the bulbs in a street light. He also wonders if its a film on the light that makes them have that color or something inside. Given a vapor light and a regular light bulb, which one is more energy efficient, the vapor light or the regular light bulb? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The vapor light is more energy efficient than a regular incandescent light bulb. Vapor lights, like sodium vapor or mercury vapor lights, have better energy efficiency and a longer lifespan compared to traditional incandescent bulbs. This is because vapor lights use the process of electroluminescence, which generates less heat and requires less energy to produce bright light. In comparison, incandescent light bulbs produce light by heating a filament inside the bulb, which results in significant energy loss in the form of heat. However, it's worth noting that there are other lighting technologies, such as compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs), that are even more energy-efficient than vapor lights.

It is important to note that both questions revolve around the central subject of India's performance in the Olympics, specifically discussing its inability to secure a significant number of medals. However, the manner in which each question addresses the issue underlines the difference between the two. 1. \\"Why are Indians not getting medals in Olympics?\\" This question pays attention to the individual athletes or teams that represent India and participate in the Olympic Games, specifically wondering why they may not be able to win medals. It highlights the individuals' performance and might invite potential reasons that encompass the athletes' preparation, talent, resources, or competitive spirit. The question implicitly suggests that if one can identify factors affecting Indian athletes, there might be room for improvement, thereby increasing the chances of India acquiring more medals in future competitions. Some potential answers to this question could include: - Lack of proper infrastructure and training facilities for Indian athletes - Insufficient financial support and resources for athletes to prepare at competitive levels - The immense focus on popular sports like cricket, leaving fewer resources and interest in Olympic sports - Cultural factors that might discourage participation in sports or prioritize academic pursuits 2. \\"Why India fails to get medals in Olympics?\\" This question shifts the focus slightly, placing the emphasis on India as a whole and not just on the individual participants. By framing the concern this way, it invites a broader perspective on the country's collective efforts and underlying systems responsible for its overall performance in the Olympic Games. The question implies that there may be structural or systemic challenges, beyond just the performance of the athletes themselves, that contribute to India's failure to secure more medals. Some possible answers to this question could include: - Inadequate sports policies and lack of long-term vision from sports authorities - Limited funding and investment in sports infrastructure and athlete development - A large population diluting the talent pool, making it harder for individuals to rise to the top - Societal attitudes towards specific sports or physical activity, preventing India from exploring the full range of sports disciplines and identifying potential talent In conclusion, while both questions are related to India's performance in the Olympics and its inability to secure more medals, they approach the issue from slightly different perspectives. The first question focuses on the individual athletes or teams and their circumstances, whereas the second question takes a broader look at the country's collective efforts and systemic challenges. Hence, analyzing both questions allows one to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to India's Olympic performance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Then he changed the temperature of the system. He labeled that experiment as case T. Finally, he observed two more experiments, case A and case B. In case A forward reaction was favored, and in case B reverse reaction was favored. and a hint : Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.

Write highlights for this article: A 21-day quarantine for all military personnel serving in Ebola stricken areas of West Africa was approved by Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel Wednesday. The quarantine was pushed for by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Hagel said. Initially the measure will apply to all personnel leaving the West Africa area. But Hagel said the policy will be reviewed within 45 days. The policy creates a separate set of rules for military members than what the White House has pushed for civilian health care workers. President Obama has argued that civilian volunteer health workers returning from aid trips to Africa should not be quarantined and the White House has urged states not to impose their own quarantine policies. Science, Obama has said, does not support the need for a quarantine. Related: Army major general speaks to CNN from inside quarantine. Asked to explain the discrepancy between civilians and the military, he said Tuesday service members have been sent to the Ebola region by him and health workers are going as volunteers. \\"It's part of their mission that's been assigned to them by their commanders and ultimately by me, the commander-in-chief,\\" the president told reporters on the White House's South Lawn on Tuesday.\\"So we don't expect to have similar rules for our military as we do for civilians,\\" Obama said. \\"They are already, by definition, if they're in the military under more circumscribed conditions.\\" The chiefs did not have new scientific or medical data about Ebola when they pressed for Hagel to approve the quarantine the military official said. \\"This is simply about the chiefs looking at the best way to take care of the force, the families and the communities to which they are returning,\\" a military official told CNN. This effort \\"is an admittedly conservative approach,\\" the official said. In their discussions the chiefs—who each head one of the military services branches—noted that many of the US troops are young and inexperienced in any medical issues. There was concern they might not adhere to an informal protocol of taking their temperature twice a day on their own. Hagel said Wednesday that the families and communities in the US and Europe where the troops are located had also expressed concern. \\"They very much wanted a safety valve on this,\\" Hagel said at an event in Washington. Rep. Mike Turner, a Republican from Ohio who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said he was \\"encouraged\\" by the new policy. \\"This act will ensure that our service men and women, their families, and our communities have the confidence that every necessary precaution is taken to ensure their health and safety.\\" The US already has 1,000 troops on the ground, and that force could grow to a total of 4,000. \\"That's the biggest group of Americans there,\\" the official said, noting that also was a factor in the chiefs thinking. \\"The chiefs believe it is better to start more restrictive and then re-assess as we get further into the Ebola operation,\\" the official said. For now, troops will be held in quarantine at bases designated by each of the military services. There will be provisions for compassionate leave—allowing troops to leave quarantine if they have a family emergency such as an illness or death. The quarantine will also not apply to those just briefly travelling to Liberia, or aircrews flying in an out, although everyone is told to monitor their temperatures. Related: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie says he won't change Ebola policy. Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno ordered an Army wide quarantine for soldiers coming back from West Africa, beginning with Major General Darryl Williams and his team. Defense officials had said the quarantine for Williams was ordered because he and his group had traveled extensively around Liberia, although they had no direct contact with Ebola patients.

Side effects include, but are not limited to, red lesions that are raised and weeping, loss of pigmentation of the skin, blisters, increased sunlight sensitivity, redness, and permanent scarring. These reactions can occur immediately after getting a temporary tattoo using traditional red henna or \\"black henna.\\" Reactions from temporary henna tattoos can also occur up to two or three weeks after receiving the tattoo. You can also experience adverse side effects from hair dye that contains “black henna.” If you are purchasing henna to use at home on your skin or hair, make sure you examine each ingredient listed on the label. Avoid any color additives in henna dyes to be used on the skin. If you are getting a henna tattoo from a tattoo artist or your hair dyed by a professional, make sure you inquire about the ingredients in the dye they will use on your skin or hair. Ask specifically about the inclusion of p-phenylenediamine, or PPD, and avoid getting a tattoo with this additive. Children can be particularly sensitive to henna. Skin sensitivities and allergic reactions to henna can occur in children. Children with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency are at particular risk, as applying henna to the skin of children with this condition can cause a life-threatening condition called hemolysis.

Unfortunately for these foolish home invaders, they were immediately arrested after being spotted on a remote surveillance camera. The man of the house, 32-year-old Chung Chang, was at work when he randomly decided to check his security gear on account of a 'sixth-sense'. He watched absolutely stunned as two men casually wandered around his living room in the city of Linyi in eastern China's Shandong province, enjoying all the facilities on offer. The nerve of them!

Question: I read this background article the other day: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. I am facing a new situation today: Beth and Jane studied chemistry in school. However, Beth studied noble gasses while Jane decided to know more about alkanes. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which student learned more about how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, it is clear that Jane studied alkanes. As the article explains the naming system of alkanes and how the first part of their name indicates the number of carbon atoms present in each molecule, we can infer that Jane learned more about how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has.

Emily was given the grand estate by her late grandparents, and even though she loved the house itself, she couldn't help but feel the pang of loneliness within its walls. Emily walked through the grand halls of the estate, which now seemed so empty. The echoing sound of her footsteps came as a stark reminder of the vastness around her. The house had a rich history that Emily wished to preserve, but she was unable to shake the notion that the manor's current state was a mere shell of its once lively self. Lost in thought, Emily found herself in the carefully curated art gallery her grandparents had so passionately put together. Her eyes darted to each piece, taking in the stories each of them told. It was then that an idea came to her, as if whispered by the very walls that now felt so empty. She would bring life back into the estate by turning it into a hotel and art gallery. Every guest would receive a guided tour of the incredible artwork, and the mansion would be home to lectures, live artists, and social gatherings - a thriving cultural hub that would celebrate the magnificent beauty of both the art and the estate. In the following weeks, Emily began compiling a list of reputable professionals, influencers, and creators who could help her bring her vision to life. Architects, interior designers, art professors, and even marketing strategists were welcomed into the estate to discuss the transformation that lay ahead. As the project gained momentum, a fresh sense of life seemed to breathe into the manor. Each day brought forth new ideas and changes, and the workers' chatter filled the once quiet spaces. Colorful fabric replaced the dust covers, and fragrant flowers adorned the halls. The barren walls now boasted stunning murals that paid homage to the estate's rich history and showcased the abundance of talent Emily had gathered. Emily dedicated herself to work tirelessly on the new venture, creating online profiles, networking with potential partners, and reaching out to her grandparents' previous connections in the art world. Eventually, word of her exciting project began to spread amongst the elite and her online presence grew. With each passing day, Emily watched the estate transform. Rooms that were once empty were now meticulously curated art spaces, each with their own theme - from Renaissance masters to innovative contemporary artists. Luxurious suites welcomed visitors with unparalleled comfort and warmth, all within a beautifully rich, artistic setting that further elevated the experience. Finally, the grand opening day arrived; the halls buzzed with excitement as an array of international connoisseurs, celebrated artists, and curious tourists graced the estate. As Emily guided them through the various art exhibits, she could sense the joy that her project brought to others. As the night settled, Emily found herself standing on her estate's balcony with a cup of tea in hand. The melodious sounds of laughter and clinking glasses floated through the air. She couldn't help but smile as she realized that, not only had she fulfilled her grandparents' legacy, but she had also created something truly unique that would bring joy to countless others in the years to come. Emily's determination, passion, and love for the art brought life back to the estate that once seemed so desolate. The echoes of her footfalls were now replaced with the sound of conversations, art, and life – a testament to the power of creativity and the strength of one visionary woman, who managed to combine her love for her family's heritage with her innate desire to forge her own path."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: This article: Paul Helfeld (also given as Hefeld), aged 21 in 1909, and Jacob Lepidus (also reported as Lapidus), who was 25 the same year, were Jewish-Latvian immigrants. They had been members of the Latvian Socialist Party and, although they had not held positions of responsibility, they had smuggled revolutionary literature into Russia for the party. The pair had been living in Paris in 1907, along with Lepidus's brother Paul, a revolutionary bomber who went under the nom de guerre \\"Strygia\\"; Jacob was described in The Times as a \\"member of a notorious Russian revolutionary family\\". On 1 May 1907 Paul Lepidus was killed when a bomb he was carrying to assassinate Armand Fallières, the President of France, exploded prematurely. Lepidus and Helfeld fled the country and lived in Scotland for a year, before moving to Tottenham.Both men joined a small group of Latvian agitators living in north London; according to other members of the group, the pair had criminal records and had joined as a cover for the robberies they carried out. Lepidus was employed, briefly, at a furniture factory, while Helfeld took a job at the Schnurmann rubber factory in Tottenham. Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police.Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery. Salnish, who often went under the name Jacob Fogel, had been an active revolutionary since the age of 13. He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia.

Just outside the town of Crescent Cove, Mike Tobacco and his girlfriend Debbie Stone are parked with other couples at the local lovers' lane when they spot a strange glowing object falling to Earth. Nearby, farmer Gene Green also spies the object, and believing it to be Halley's Comet, he ventures into the woods to find the impact site. He instead stumbles upon a large circus tent-like structure, and he and his dog are abruptly captured by mysterious clown-like aliens, the \\"Klowns\\". Shortly thereafter, Mike and Debbie arrive to investigate for themselves. Entering the structure, they discover a complex interior with elevators and various bizarre rooms. They soon find a gelatinized Green encased in a cotton candy-like cocoon and are spotted by a klown, who shoots popcorn at them from a large gun. The couple flees, pursued by a group of klowns and a balloon animal dog that comes to life. Narrowly escaping, Mike and Debbie travel to the police station to report the incident to Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Deputy Dave Hanson, and his curmudgeonly partner, Deputy Curtis Mooney. The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: John is a soil scientist. He has been studying the lands near Mississippi delta. He noticed cases of hypoxia in that are. He labeled that study as case A. To compare that to other areas he visited Arizona. There he didn't see any occurrence of hypoxia. He labeled that case as case B. Which case would less likely see formation of toxic compounds, case A or case B? Hint: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Answer:","completion":"Case B would be less likely to see the formation of toxic compounds. This is because hypoxia is not observed in Arizona, unlike in the Mississippi delta (case A).

In the first quarter, Kansas City trailed early as Broncos kicker Jason Elam managed to get a 44-yard field goal. Afterwards, the Chiefs managed to tie the game with kicker Dave Rayner getting a 38-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Kansas City took the lead with Safety Bernard Pollard blocking a punt from deep within Denver territory. The ball would roll the back of the endzone for a safety. However, the Broncos went back into the lead with Elam getting a 50-yard field goal. The Chiefs would take the halftime lead as Rayner kicked a 36-yard field goal. In the third quarter, K.C. trailed big as Denver RB Selvin Young got a 20-yard TD pass, while LB Nate Webster returned a fumble 17&#160;yards for a touchdown. Even worse, starting-QB Damon Huard would leave the game on that play due to a concussion. Back-up QB Brodie Croyle took over the Chiefs offense for the remainder of the game. Later in the period, K.C. tried to rally as Rayner nailed a 39-yard field goal.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was said to have \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers?\\" from the following article ? The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

Context: Zoos are not my favorite places. I always wish the animals could be free. I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around.

However, the hypothesis you propose doesn't necessarily follow from this premise. The hypothesis is changing the food type to fresh greens and ranch dressing and it opposes the initial premise by suggesting that one should keep watching their weight. That is somewhat contradictory to the original premise which requested an abandonment of weight concerns. The core idea in the premise is about indulgence in the seasonally offered food, specifically fresh strawberries and cream, without concerning about the dietary constrains or weight. It illustrates a context of permissible self-pampering, persuading to momentarily forget about any weight-related worries. On the contrary, your hypothesis promotes a consciousness about one's weight, advocating for a healthy choice of fresh greens and ranch dressing, which is traditionally considered as a healthier option. This concept essentially varies greatly from the 'indulgence without guilt' theme observed in the premise. In addition, the proposed hypothesis also changes the type of food specified in the premise. Therefore, it neither logically flows from the initial premise nor remains consistent with the suggested idea.It is not a falsified suggestion, rather a different perspective promoting health consciousness. Therefore, whilst your hypothesis could stand as a valid suggestion for someone seeking to maintain their weight, it does not logically follow or derive from the given premise directly. A more accurate conclusion from the original premise would be something along the lines of, \\"When the season arrives, free yourself from weight concerns and relish the island's range of fresh fruit and cream dishes offered by its many restaurants and cafes.\\""},{"prompt":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

The site features a streaming video of a kitten being tortured and killed.After the kitten's death, KillWithMe's webmaster (Joseph Cross) 'graduates' to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid killwithme but, as Marsh feared, this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his various victims include a helicopter pilot (who is bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt by heat lamps) and Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged).At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is not the case. The first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable, techno-prodigy son, Owen Reilly, broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to prove a point (that the public is insatiable for the suffering of others), as well as wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's tragedy. Dowd was killed because he came close to the truth of who the murderer was. Marsh, who figures this out, is soon targeted as well.Captured by Reilly, Marsh escapes her death-by-mulcher by swinging out of the way while dangling from the ceiling. She ends up breaking free and gunning down the murderer just as the other police show up, Marsh kills Reilly on his own website.

Q: What are the pores in plants that keep certain gases and liquids in and out called? A: Answer:","completion":"The pores in plants that regulate the exchange of gases and liquids, allowing the uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and release of oxygen, water vapor, and other gases, are known as stomata (singular: stoma). Stomata play a critical role in plant physiology, ensuring that the plant receives necessary resources, maintains a balanced water potential, and effectively carries out various physiological processes. These tiny adjustable pores are predominantly found on the surface of leaves, specifically the epidermis, and occasionally on stems and other organs. Structurally, each stoma is surrounded by two specialized parenchyma cells, called guard cells, which are responsible for controlling the opening and closing of the stoma. The size and distribution of stomata vary among different plant species, allowing for efficient gas exchange and water management depending on the specific environment and plant requirements. In general, stomata open during the day to allow for carbon dioxide uptake and close during the night to reduce water loss. However, some plants native to arid regions, such as cacti, have adapted to open their stomata during cooler nights to minimize water loss. In addition to photosynthesis, stomata are crucial for a process called transpiration. Transpiration refers to the loss of water vapor from the plant's aerial parts, such as leaves and stems, to the atmosphere. When stomata open for gas exchange, water vapor can also escape the leaf, helping the plant to maintain an optimal temperature and balance its water supply. Additionally, transpiration creates a pulling force that aids in the uptake of water and dissolved nutrients from the soil through the plant's root system, ultimately facilitating their transport to the various plant organs. The opening and closing of stomata are controlled by various factors, including environmental conditions, internal signals, and the guard cells' turgidity. Some key factors influencing stomatal movement are: 1. Light: Stomata usually open in the presence of light, as photosynthesis occurs during daylight hours and requires a continuous supply of carbon dioxide. 2. Carbon dioxide concentration: Changes in the internal carbon dioxide concentration signal the stomata to open or close based on the plant's photosynthetic and respiratory needs. 3. Humidity: High external humidity promotes stomatal opening, whereas low humidity causes stomata to close, helping the plant conserve water. 4. Temperature: Elevated temperatures can cause stomata to open, increasing transpiration and evaporation rates for optimal temperature regulation. However, this response can vary among plant species and differs in extreme temperature conditions. 5. Hormones and signaling molecules: Hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) can trigger stomatal closure under stress conditions, such as drought, to prevent excessive water loss. In summary, stomata are crucial structures in plants that regulate the exchange of gases and liquids, ensuring optimal functioning of essential processes like photosynthesis, respiration, and transpiration. Controlled by both environmental and internal factors, stomata help plants maintain their overall health and adapt to changing conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Industrial processes were no longer limited by power transmission using line shafts, belts, compressed air or hydraulic pressure. Instead every machine could be equipped with its own electric motor, providing easy control at the point of use, and improving power transmission efficiency. Electric motors applied in agriculture eliminated human and animal muscle power from such tasks as handling grain or pumping water. Household uses of electric motors reduced heavy labor in the home and made higher standards of convenience, comfort and safety possible. Today, electric motors stand for more than half of the electric energy consumption in the US. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): In what domain did electric motors reduce reliance on humans and animals?","completion":"Electric motors have significantly reduced the reliance on human and animal labor in various domains. One notable domain where electric motors have made a huge impact is the agricultural industry. Before the advent of electric motors, most of the labor-intensive tasks in agriculture, such as plowing, harvesting, handling grain, and pumping water, were accomplished through human and animal muscle power. With the introduction of electric motors, these tasks have become more efficient and less reliant on manual efforts. Another important domain where electric motors have replaced human and animal labor is the industrial sector. Thanks to electric motors, industrial processes are no longer limited by power transmission using old-fashioned methods like line shafts, belts, compressed air, or hydraulic pressure. Electric motors have made it possible to equip every machine with its own power source, enabling better control, increased operational efficiency, and enhanced productivity. In addition to these major domains, electric motors have also revolutionized household tasks, leading to significant labor reduction. With household appliances like washing machines, dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, and food processors, powered by electric motors, everyday chores that once required a substantial amount of manual labor have been made much simpler and quicker. In conclusion, electric motors have played a crucial role in reducing reliance on humans and animals in various domains, with agriculture and industry being the most significant examples. The widespread application of electric motors continues to provide higher standards of convenience, comfort, and safety across multiple sectors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite this, Huxley strongly supported Darwin on evolution; though he called for experiments to show whether natural selection could form new species, and questioned if Darwin's gradualism was sufficient without sudden leaps to cause speciation. Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science. Huxley gained influence, and initiated the X Club, which used the journal Nature to promote evolution and naturalism, shaping much of late Victorian science.

John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.

Brett Favre was born in Gulfport, Mississippi, the son of Bonita Ann (nee French) and Irvin Ernest Favre, and raised in the small town of Kiln. Both of his parents were schoolteachers in the Hancock County School District. He is of part French ancestry. One of his ancestors is Simon Favre, a Creole, was an influential figure in Spanish West Florida in the late 18th and early 19th centuries; Brett descends from Simon's Choctaw Native American mistress, Pistikiokonay, and thus his grandfather was affiliated with the Choctaw. In the second game of the 1992 season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers were leading 17-0 at halftime when head coach Mike Holmgren benched starting quarterback Don Majkowski and Favre played the second half. On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a pass that was deflected by Buccaneers player Ray Seals and caught by Favre. Favre was tackled and the completion went for -7 yards. The Packers lost the game 31-3, chalking up only 106 yards passing. In the third game of the 1992 season, Majkowski injured a ligament in his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe enough that he would be out for four weeks. Favre replaced Majkowski for the remainder of the game. Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer. However, down 23-17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8-yard line. Favre then completed a 42-yard pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. Three plays later, Favre threw the game-winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining. The next week's game against the Pittsburgh Steelers began the longest consecutive starts streak for a quarterback in NFL history. The game ended in a 17-3 victory and his passer rating was 144.6. During the season, Favre helped put together a six-game winning streak for the Packers, the longest winning streak for the club since 1965. They ended 9-7 that season, missing the playoffs on their last game. Favre finished his first season as a Packer with 3,227 yards and a quarterback rating of 85.3, helping him to his first Pro Bowl. The following season, Favre helped the Packers to their first playoff berth since 1982 and was named to his second Pro Bowl. Favre had his first career 400 yard passing game and led the NFC in pass attempts, pass completions, and pass interceptions. Favre also had four game winning drives giving him seven for his career up to that point. After the season, Favre became a free agent. General manager Ron Wolf negotiated Favre into a five-year, 19 million contract. The Packers finished the 1994 season with a 9-7 record, advancing to the playoffs in back to back years, a feat they had not accomplished since the Vince Lombardi era.

Answer the following question: Information: - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Loch Tay (Scottish Gaelic, \\"Loch Tatha\\") is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Northern Isles is an archipelago comprising a chain of islands off the north coast of mainland Scotland. The climate is cool and temperate and much influenced by the surrounding seas. There are two main island groups: Shetland and Orkney. There are a total of 26 inhabited islands with landscapes of the fertile agricultural islands of Orkney contrasting with the more rugged Shetland islands to the north, where the economy is more dependent on fishing and the oil wealth of the surrounding seas. Both have a developing renewable energy industry. They also share a common Pictish and Norse history. Both island groups were absorbed into the Kingdom of Scotland in the 15th century and remained part of the country following the formation of the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, and later the United Kingdom after 1801. The islands played a significant naval role during the world wars of the 20th century. - In common law systems, land tenure is the legal regime in which land is owned by an individual, who is said to \\"hold\\" the land. The French verb \\"tenir\\" means \\"to hold\\" and \\"tenant\\" is the present participle of \\"tenir\\". The sovereign monarch, known as The Crown, held land in its own right. All private owners are either its tenants or sub-tenants. \\"Tenure\\" signifies the relationship between tenant and lord, not the relationship between tenant and land. - Crofting is a form of land tenure and small-scale food production particular to the Scottish Highlands, the islands of Scotland, and formerly on the Isle of Man. Within the 19th century townships, individual crofts are established on the better land, and a large area of poorer-quality hill ground is shared by all the crofters of the township for grazing of their livestock. - The Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Innse Gall\\"; Old Norse: \\"Suðreyjar\\") comprise a widespread and diverse archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland. There are two main groups: the Inner and Outer Hebrides. These islands have a long history of occupation dating back to the Mesolithic, and the culture of the residents has been affected by the successive influences of Celtic, Norse, and English-speaking peoples. This diversity is reflected in the names given to the islands, which are derived from the languages that have been spoken there in historic and perhaps prehistoric times. - Perth and Kinross is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland and a Lieutenancy Area. It borders onto the Aberdeenshire, Angus, Argyll and Bute, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, Fife, Highland and Stirling council areas. Perth is the administrative centre. The council boundaries correspond broadly, but not exactly, with the former counties of Perthshire and Kinross-shire. - Fearnan ( Gaelic Feàrnan , ' Alders ' ) is a small crofting village on the north shore of Loch Tay in Perthshire , Scotland . The village lies at the junction of the road to Glen Lyon and the road between Kenmore and Killin that runs along the north side of the loch . The land around the village has at various times in history belonged to both the Robertsons of Struan and the Campbells . The village is now a mix of old crofts dating back up to 400 years and new builds mainly from the 1980s . There is also a whole hidden village of crofts with just their foundations left , just below the forestry of Drummond Hill . Visitors who wish to explore the area are encouraged to park at the village hall and walk up the field opposite , clamber over the wall and walk right , where there is a road covered in fern , then walk up the hill , and with a bit of searching they will find the remnants of the houses . The village 's only hotel , the Tigh - an - Loan , went out of business in 2008 and the building was demolished a year later . Up to the early 1970s , this loch - side hotel also ran a small garage / filling station plus the village post office . The latter moved to a new building just east of the junction for Fortingall but even that closed in 2001 and now the nearest shops are in Kenmore , 3.5 miles away . Along with several other village schools around Loch Tay , the one class village primary school ( where Kate Maynard was the last teacher ) closed in 1983 when a new comprehensive primary school opened in the grounds of Taymouth Castle in Kenmore . Secondary school pupils have always had to travel to Aberfeldy ( 10 miles from Fearnan ) and that situation continues today . Across the road from the former school building lies the remains of Fearnan Pier , one of five intermediate piers served until 1946 by the Caledonian ( later LMS ) Railway 's steamers plying from Killin to Kenmore and back . At the top of the road leading up from the lochside , 20 metres past Quarry Road ( a single lane road accessing the top... - Perthshire, officially the County of Perth, is a registration county in central Scotland. It extends from Strathmore in the east, to the Pass of Drumochter in the north, Rannoch Moor and Ben Lui in the west, and Aberfoyle in the south. It was a local government county from 1890 to 1930. - Ben Lui (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Laoigh) is a mountain in the southern Highlands of Scotland, at the head of Glen Fyne. It has five well-defined ridges radiating out from the summit. Four corries lie between the ridges; including Coire Gaothaich which lies on the northeast side of the mountain. - The Pass of Drumochter is the main mountain pass between the northern and southern central Scottish Highlands. The A9 road passes through here, as does the Highland Main Line, the railway between Inverness and the south of Scotland. The Sustrans National Cycle Route 7 between Glasgow and Inverness also runs through the pass. - Rannoch Moor (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Mòinteach Raineach/Raithneach\\") is an expanse of around 50 square miles (130 km²) of boggy moorland to the west of Loch Rannoch in Scotland, where it extends from and into westerly Perth and Kinross, northerly Lochaber (in Highland), and the area of Highland Scotland toward its south-west, northern Argyll and Bute. Rannoch Moor is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The Highlands (\\"the place of the Gaels\\") are a historic region of Scotland. The region became culturally distinguishable from the Lowlands from the later Middle Ages into the modern period, when Lowland Scots replaced Scottish Gaelic throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault, although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The Great Glen divides the Grampian Mountains to the southeast from the Northwest Highlands. The Scottish Gaelic name of \\"A' Ghàidhealtachd\\" literally means \\"the place of the Gaels\\" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the Western Isles and the Highlands. - Loch is the Irish and Scottish Gaelic word for a lake or for a sea inlet. It is cognate with the Manx lough, Cornish logh, and the Welsh word for lake, llyn. - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information.

It becomes: 73 * l + 41 * l = -912 Now, add 73 and 41 together (like counting your candies 😊). You'll get: 114 * l = -912 Now, to find l, just like sharing your candy equally with your friends, we'll divide -912 by 114: l = -912 ÷ 114 When you divide these numbers, you'll get: l = -8 So, the value of l is -8.

The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage.

Which population would less likley develop cardiovascular diseases, population A or population B? Mike is studying the population growth rate of countries around the world. He noticed that countries like Japan and Russia are having a demographic shift. They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people. He recorded younger population as population B. Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Answer:","completion":"Population B would be less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases. The paragraph discusses the two populations being studied by Mike. Population A consists of the late adulthood population, as seen in countries like Japan and Russia experiencing a demographic shift. Population B consists of the younger population in many developing countries. The hint provided indicates that during late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. There is also a decline in strength and stamina, failing senses, and an increase in reflex time. The immune system loses its efficiency, making common diseases like the flu more serious and potentially fatal. Many late adults develop arthritis, and up to one in four late adults may develop Alzheimer's disease. Based on this information, it is clear that population A (late adulthood population) has a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases as well as other health issues mentioned in the hint.

Summarize this article: Former IAAF consultant Papa Massata Diack and Russian officials Valentin Balakhnichev and Alexei Melnikov were last month charged with multiple breaches of anti-doping rules relating to Russian athlete Liliya Shobukhova. Ex-IAAF anti-doping director Gabriel Dolle has been banned for five years. IAAF president Lord Coe said the bans \\"could not send a stronger message\\". Diack and Balakhnichev, a former president of the Russian athletics federation and IAAF treasurer, face fines of £17,000 while Russian coach Melnikov could be fined £10,000. The independent IAAF ethics commission panel's 170-page report claims Diack, Balakhnichev and Melnikov conspired to \\"blackmail\\" Shobukhova to cover up her doping violations by her paying them \\"bribes\\" of about £435,000. Last month, Diack told the BBC he \\"totally rejects\\" the blackmail allegations, saying: \\"There was no extortion of funds from any athlete.\\" The panel said: \\"The head of a national federation, the senior coach of a major national team and a marketing consultant for the IAAF conspired together (and, it may yet be proven with others too) to conceal for more than three years' anti-doping violations by an athlete at what appeared to be the highest pinnacle of her sport. \\"They acted dishonestly and corruptly and did unprecedented damage to the sport of track and field which, by their actions, they have brought into serious disrepute.\\" Shobukhova's 38-month ban from track and field was reduced by seven months after she turned whistleblower for the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). Russia have been banned from international athletics competition after a report by Wada's independent commission alleged the country was guilty of \\"state-sponsored doping\\". BBC Sport's Matt Slater There is an old rule of journalism that you should always get the name of the dog in any story about a domestic tragedy or natural disaster - the idea being it is the pet with a cute name that really grabs your audience. There should be an amendment to that rule for this golden age of sporting scandal: get the name of the dodgy bank account. In the case of the scam to suppress positive drug tests by Russian athletes in return for cash, it is called 'Black Tidings'. How apt for a grim tale that involves drugs, mysterious meetings, blackmail, a cosmopolitan cast of pantomime villains and the Olympics. The weirdest thing about reading the 170-page into how the IAAF president's son and two leading Russian officials colluded to extract huge sums of money from a drugs cheat - while Dolle, the IAAF's anti-doping boss, looked at his finger nails and whistled - is you almost feel sorry for the cheat. Almost. The most alarming thing for athletics is this report - into one scam, involving one athlete - will be the mildest indictment of the moral malaise at the sport's heart in the coming weeks and months. There is far worse to come, which the report hints at with references to other athletes, other officials and other countries. Black tidings indeed.

The carbonate anion forms an equilibrium with protons that results in some formation of carbon dioxide. Story: Tom and John are both pool owners.

Here is a question about this article: Eisenhower's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties encountered during his involvement in the U.S. Army's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy. He was assigned as an observer for the mission, which involved sending a convoy of U.S. Army vehicles coast to coast. His subsequent experience with encountering German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System. Noticing the improved ability to move logistics throughout the country, he thought an Interstate Highway System in the U.S. would not only be beneficial for military operations, but provide a measure of continued economic growth.

Here are possible answers to this question: - fan - energy - vacuuming - mop - broom I believe the correct choice is \\"mop\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"mop. Here's why: Wet cleaning a floor, also known as mopping, is a process that involves using a cleaning solution with water to remove dirt, grime, and stains from various flooring surfaces such as tile, linoleum, and hardwood. When performing wet cleaning or mopping, having the proper tools and equipment is essential to achieving a clean, sanitary, and presentable floor. Among the given choices, the correct tool for wet cleaning is a mop. Allow me to explain the reasons behind this choice and provide an overview of why other options are not suitable for this particular task. 1. Mop: A mop is a cleaning tool specifically designed for wet cleaning floors. It has a long handle and a cleaning head with absorbent material, such as microfiber, cotton, or sponge, which readily soaks up water and cleaning solution, making it the perfect tool for wet cleaning. When you navigate the mop across the floor, with the right amount of pressure and movement, dirt and grime are efficiently lifted and absorbed by the mop head, leaving the floor clean and fresh. 2. Fan: A fan is used to create airflow and circulate air within a room, typically used for ventilation or cooling purposes. While a fan might help to dry the floor after it has been wet cleaned, it would not effectively assist in the actual cleaning process. Therefore, a fan is not the correct choice for wet cleaning a floor. 3. Energy: Energy is the capacity to perform work or complete tasks, and it is a required resource for any activity, including housework or wet cleaning. Although important, energy alone cannot accomplish the task of wet cleaning a floor. Having the physical energy to clean is necessary; however, it does not replace the need for a proper cleaning tool such as a mop. 4. Vacuuming: Vacuuming is a method of dry cleaning floors and carpets, which entails using a vacuum cleaner to remove dirt, dust, and debris from surfaces. A vacuum cleaner uses suction to pick up dirt and is designed primarily for use on carpets or rugs; it is not created for wet cleaning purposes. Therefore, using a vacuum cleaner to wet clean a floor is not appropriate or efficient. 5. Broom: A broom is another tool used for cleaning floors, but it is exclusively designed for dry cleaning or sweeping dust and debris. Brooms consist of a long handle and stiff bristles that enable you to push dirt from one area to another, which is helpful for gathering debris before disposing of it. Brooms are not suitable for wet cleaning, as their bristles are not designed to absorb water or a cleaning solution and will not adequately clean grime or stains from the floor. In conclusion, a mop is the correct choice for wet cleaning a floor while doing housework, due to its design and ability to absorb water mixed with a cleaning solution. Using a mop ensures that the floor is thoroughly cleaned, sanitized, and left looking presentable. Other options, such as a fan, energy, vacuuming, and broom, either provide no actual assistance in the cleaning process or are not designed for wet cleaning tasks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They seek to explore new places, experience new cuisines, engage in leisure activities, and indulge in things they love to do, which is essentially to have fun. Fun, in this context, comes in different shapes and perspectives for everyone. For some, having fun might mean lying on a beach under a tropical sun, reading a book, or simply enjoying the serenity. For others, it could mean exploring an unfamiliar city, trying new adventurous sports, learning about a new culture, or even going on a shopping spree. Then there are those who go on holidays to spend quality and joyful time with their families and friends. They may plan activities that they all can enjoy together, such as camping, hiking, picnicking, visiting amusement parks or museums, etc. Moreover, vacation is also a time when people can pursue their hobbies and passions which they otherwise cannot due to their busy daily schedules. For instance, wildlife enthusiasts may plan a trip to wildlife sanctuaries to photograph the animals in their natural habitats; food lovers may go on a culinary tour to try out different authentic dishes; music and dance lovers might attend a music festival or a dance workshop, and much more. Additionally, having fun on vacation also means having a break from stress and rejuvenating oneself, both physically and mentally. It’s a time to create enjoyable and memorable moments that can keep one refreshed long after the vacation is over. Hence, when people go on vacations, they are looking forward to having fun and taking a respite from the daily grind of life, which implies they want to create an environment of enjoyment and pleasure for themselves.

Q:Question: If grass is given plenty of water and light, what will it do? Options: - burn - changes color with seasons - turn brown - continue to grow - eat water Explain why a human would choose \\"continue to grow\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"continue to grow\\" as the answer to the question because: Step 1: Identifying key information in the question The question provides information about grass receiving both water and light, which are two essential components for plant growth. Step 2: Examining the optional answers Option 1: Burn - Water helps hydrate the grass and maintains its health, while light provides the energy for the grass to grow through photosynthesis. This combination does not create a burning effect on the grass. Option 2: Changes color with seasons - While some plants change color with seasons, it is not predominantly due to the presence of water and light. Option 3: Turn brown - Grass turns brown when it lacks enough water or nutrients. As the question states it receives sufficient water, this answer is unlikely. Option 4: Continue to grow - With an ample supply of water and light, grass can photosynthesis and absorb nutrients from the soil, resulting in growth. This answer seems the most plausible. Option 5: Eat water - Grass does not \\"eat\\" water. Plants absorb water through their roots and utilize it for growth, but they do not consume it as food. Step 3: Determine the most reasonable choice Given the information provided in the question and the analysis of the possible answers, a human would choose \\"continue to grow\\" because it is the most logical response, given that grass relies on water and light for growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stoke will assess the condition of forward Mame Biram Diouf ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with Leicester at the Britannia Stadium. Since scoring the Potters' winner in their shock victory at Manchester City on August 30, Diouf has been away on international duty with Senegal and had not been back in training with his club by Friday. Stoke's Mame Biram Diouf scored a shock winner for Stoke in their 1-0 victory at Manchester City. Winger Oussama Assaidi is in contention to make his 'second debut' after rejoining the Staffordshire outfit on another season-long loan deal from Liverpool on transfer deadline day. But midfielder Stephen Ireland (rib) looks set to miss out along with Geoff Cameron (hernia) and Peter Odemwingie (knee), both of whom have undergone surgery. Provisional squad: Begovic, Sorensen, Bardsley, Pieters, Huth, Muniesa, Wilson, Shawcross, Teixeira, Wilkinson, Whelan, Palacios, Nzonzi, Adam, Sidwell, Walters, Arnautovic, Diouf, Bojan, Crouch, Moses. Leicester. A trio of new signings come into the reckoning for Leicester manager Nigel Pearson ahead of his side's Barclays Premier League clash with Stoke on Saturday. Defender Danny Simpson, along with strikers Tom Lawrence and Nick Powell - the latter on loan from Manchester United - are added to the squad for the game at the Britannia Stadium. Promising youngster Tom Lawrence has arrived at Leicester from Manchester United on a permanent basis. Defender Matthew Upson (foot) remains sidelined, and although Matty James is training again after a lay-off with a shin injury, the game comes too soon for the midfielder. Provisional squad: Schmeichel, Hamer, De Laet, Konchesky, Wasilewski, Schlupp, Moore, Morgan, King, Hammond, Albrighton, Knockaert, Mahrez, Vardy, Taylor-Fletcher, Ulloa, Nugent, Wood, Drinkwater, Cambiasso, Simpson, Powell, Lawrence. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) The Potters are unbeaten in five home meetings with Leicester in all competitions (W4 D1). Indeed, none of the last 10 clashes between the Potters and the Foxes have been won by the away side (six home wins, four draws). Leicester City are without a clean sheet in 11 Premier League games; the longest run of any current top-flight side. Since the start of last season, only Chelsea (2) and Liverpool (5) have scored more than once against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium. Stoke are unbeaten in their last five home meetings with Leicester, not losing since James Scowcroft scored the only goal for the Foxes in an August 2002 second tier clash. The Potters, who lost 1-0 to Aston Villa on the opening day, have not lost consecutive home league games since April 2013. Nigel Pearson’s side have scored in 33 of their last 34 league games, failing only to net against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Indeed, that 2-0 defeat at Chelsea was Leicester’s first away defeat this calendar year (W8 D4). The Foxes have blocked 25 opposition shots so far this season; at least 10 more than any other team in the Premier League. Stoke are the only Premier League side yet to net in the first-half in 2014-15. Leicester new boy Nick Powell currently has the best min/goal ratio of any player in Premier League history, having scored once in 29 minutes of top-flight football. Highlights:","completion":"This weekend, Stoke City and Leicester City are going to play a big soccer game. This is important because both teams have good players and it will be exciting to see who wins. Stoke City has some players who might be a little tired because they played in other games recently, while Leicester City has some new players who are ready to play.

Several days ago, I tried entering a lift with one of my arms fixed in a bandage while carrying a computer bag in the other. Not being fast enough, I was passed by two young people who managed to get into the lift before me. The lift door closed only after I entered. Having already pressed their wanted floor button, the young people waited impatiently for me to press the button for where I was going. If they had decided to help, we could have moved much faster. But they had not. So I did my best and pressed the button with my arm. The two young people looked very angry with me. I was losing heart. The memory of this incident has stayed with me because it followed shortly after my building's watchman refused to help me carry a heavy box full of books.

Its confrontational lyrics originated in an extended piece of verse Dylan wrote in June 1965, when he returned exhausted from a grueling tour of England. Dylan distilled this draft into four verses and a chorus. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" was recorded a few weeks later as part of the sessions for the forthcoming album \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". - CBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is a flagship property of CBS Corporation. The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City (at the CBS Broadcast Center) and Los Angeles (at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center). - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. - Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles. - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument. - Columbia Records (also known simply as Columbia) is an American record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME), a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America, Inc., the United States division of Sony Corporation. It was founded in 1887, evolving from an earlier enterprise named the American Graphophone Company, the successor to the Volta Graphophone Company. Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990. It is one of Sony Music's three flagship record labels alongside RCA Records and Epic Records. - The American folk-music revival was a phenomenon in the United States that began during the 1940s and peaked in popularity in the mid-1960s. Its roots went earlier, and performers like Josh White, Burl Ives, Woody Guthrie, Lead Belly, Big Bill Broonzy, Richard Dyer-Bennet, Oscar Brand, Jean Ritchie, John Jacob Niles, Susan Reed, Paul Robeson and Cisco Houston had enjoyed a limited general popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. The revival brought forward styles of American folk music that had, in earlier times, contributed to the development of country and western, jazz, and rock and roll music. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services. These make Sony one of the most comprehensive entertainment companies in the world. Sony's principal business operations include Sony Corporation, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment, Sony Mobile (formerly Sony Ericsson) and Sony Financial. Sony is among the Semiconductor sales leaders by year and as of 2013, the fourth-largest television manufacturer in the world, after Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and TCL. - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in the summer of 1962. It was first recorded in Columbia Records' Studio A on December 6, 1962 for his second album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". The lyrical structure is based on the question and answer form of traditional ballads such as Lord Randall. Dylan has stated that all of the lyrics were taken from the initial lines of songs that \\"he thought he would never have time to write.\\" - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. - Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. It was released on August 30, 1965, by Columbia Records. Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing 11-minute ballad, \\"Desolation Row\\". Critics have focused on the innovative way in which Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that in an important sense the 1960s \\"started\\" with this album. - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. In recent years, it has resumed its traditional mix of content. - A protest song is a song that is associated with a movement for social change and hence part of the broader category of \\"topical\\" songs (or songs connected to current events). It may be folk, classical, or commercial in genre. - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME). It is one of SME's flagship record labels alongside sister labels Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in U.S. history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression. - \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" is a song written by Bob Dylan in 1962 and released as a single and on his album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" in 1963. Although it has been described as a protest song, it poses a series of rhetorical questions about peace, war and freedom. The refrain \\"The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind\\" has been described as \\"impenetrably ambiguous: either the answer is so obvious it is right in your face, or the answer is as intangible as the wind\\". - A subsidiary, subsidiary company or daughter company is a company that is owned or controlled by another company, which is called the \\"parent company\\", \\"parent\\", or \\"holding company\\". The subsidiary can be a company, corporation, or limited liability company. In some cases it is a government or state-owned enterprise. - \`\` Gates of Eden '' is a song by Bob Dylan that appears on his fifth studio album Bringing It All Back Home , released on March 22 , 1965 by Columbia Records . It was also released as a single as the B - side of \`\` Like a Rolling Stone '' . Dylan plays the song solo , accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica . It is one of his more surreal songs . In a 2005 Mojo magazine poll of its writers and various well - known musicians , \`\` Gates of Eden '' was ranked 69th among Dylan 's 100 greatest songs . - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information. - EMI (officially EMI Group Limited, originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries and often known as EMI Records and EMI Music) was a British multinational conglomerate founded in March 1931 and was based in London. At the time of its break-up in 2012, it was the fourth-largest business group and family of record labels in the recording industry and was one of the big four record companies (now the big three). Its EMI Records Ltd. group of record labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records and Capitol Records. EMI also had a major publishing arm, EMI Music Publishingalso based in London with offices globally. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - American folk music is a musical term that encompasses numerous genres, many of which are known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and can sometimes be traced back to such places of origin as Great Britain, Europe, or Africa. Mike Seeger once famously commented that the definition of American folk music is \\"All the music that fits between the cracks.\\" - Epic Records is an American record company. A division of Sony Music Entertainment, Inc., Epic was founded predominantly as a jazz and classical music label in 1953. It later expanded its scope to include diverse musical genres including pop, R&B, rock and hip hop. Historically, the label has housed popular acts such as Boston, Celine Dion, Dave Clark Five, Gloria Estefan, Pearl Jam, Shakira, and Sly & the Family Stone. - Bringing It All Back Home is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on March 22, 1965 by Columbia Records. The album is divided into an electric and an acoustic side, although the acoustic side included some tracks in which other instruments were backing up Dylan and his guitar, but no drums were used. On side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll banda move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk music community. Likewise, on the acoustic second side of the album, he distanced himself from the protest songs with which he had become closely identified (such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\"), as his lyrics continued their trend towards the abstract and personal. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.

Write a \\"negative\\" movie review ( --negative --positive).","completion":"Title: Shattered Expectations: A Negative Take on \\"Paradise Skies\\" As a compassionate film enthusiast, it pains me to dig into a movie with a critical scalpel. But \\"Paradise Skies,\\" a much-anticipated drama written by the up-and-coming director Roger Macinroe, is a glaring exception. When audiences flocked to the theaters, hoping to witness a masterpiece in the making, \\"Paradise Skies\\" instead left us in a shambles of disappointment and unfulfilled promises. The premise of the film centered around a once-prosperous family spiraling into turmoil in their tropical paradise mansion. This enticing concept was prime material for exploring family dynamics, introspection, and human struggles. However, as opposed to a compelling family drama, \\"Paradise Skies\\" proved to be little more than an exhaustive collection of clichés and melodramatic moments. The first issue was the amateurish screenplay. While Macinroe may be an accomplished director, his writing skills left much to be desired. The dialogue often felt forced and unnatural, awkwardly punctuated with dramatic pauses and unnecessary outbursts. Many of the lines seemed to be ripped from the pages of an aspiring teenage screenwriter, failing to bring depth to the characters they were meant to represent. The portrayal of the family's relationships felt almost like a parody, brimming with sweeping generalizations and a misguided vision of what family intricacies should be. As the film progressed, the characters became increasingly two-dimensional, each defined by a single trait that informed their actions and behaviors throughout the film. The film further suffered due to lackluster acting. With such a star-studded cast, one would expect the characters to come alive despite the subpar script. Sadly, their performances only contributed to the movie's downfall. The actors seemed disengaged, as though their hearts were not truly invested in their respective roles. It felt as though the actors were phoning in their performances, which failed to evoke any emotional response from the audience. Additionally, the film's pacing was volatile, bouncing between sluggish scenes and rapid-fire sequences that left viewers disoriented. This created a disjointed narrative and stifled the storyline's momentum. As the story lurched forward, vital plot points were glazed over, leaving viewers struggling to piece them together with minimal information. Visually, \\"Paradise Skies\\" was striking, boasting lush cinematography that was only a saving grace on the surface. But when paired with its nonsensical plot and predictability, the movie's aesthetic beauty quickly lost its enchantment. The result was a hollow and superficial attempt to curry favor with the audience as it flailed and lost its way. Moreover, serious topics like addiction, mental health issues, and societal expectations were brought up throughout the film but reduced to plot devices and unceremoniously discarded when no longer convenient. This careless handling of sensitive issues felt like a lost opportunity that could have brought depth to the otherwise cardboard characters. \\"Paradise Skies\\" could have been a groundbreaking exploration of human emotions and relationships, but due to its flawed script, disinterested acting, and poor handling of serious topics, it fails on almost every level. It is a disheartening example of squandered potential, as audiences will walk away unsatisfied, lamenting the wasted opportunity to create something truly extraordinary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The builders destroyed the warehouse with explosives. Available options: - unacceptable - acceptable","completion":"A linguist would find the following sentence to be an acceptable English sentence grammatically. \\"The builders destroyed the warehouse with explosives.\\" In this sentence, we can observe several grammatical elements that make the sentence perfectly valid in terms of English grammar. Let's break down the sentence and analyze these elements: 1. Subject: The subject of the sentence is \\"the builders.\\" This noun phrase consists of a definite article \\"the\\" and a plural noun \\"builders.\\" It clearly defines who or what the sentence is talking about. In this case, it is talking about a specific group of people who destroyed the warehouse. 2. Verb: The verb in the sentence, \\"destroyed,\\" is a transitive past-tense verb that indicates an action was performed by the subject (the builders). A transitive verb requires a direct object, which in this sentence is \\"the warehouse,\\" to complete its meaning. This verb properly agrees with the subject in terms of tense and number. 3. Direct object: The direct object of the sentence is \\"the warehouse.\\" Similar to the subject, this noun phrase consists of a definite article \\"the\\" and a singular noun \\"warehouse.\\" It receives the action of the verb (being destroyed) and provides more information about what action the subject took. 4. Prepositional phrase: The prepositional phrase \\"with explosives\\" provides additional information about the action of the verb. In this sentence, the preposition \\"with\\" shows the method or means by which the action (destroying the warehouse) was carried out. The prepositional phrase consists of the preposition \\"with\\" and the plural noun \\"explosives\\" as its object. Using these grammatical elements, the sentence communicates the meaning effectively and follows the English language's standard grammatical rules.

Moore chronicles how GM had previously defined his childhood while growing up in Flint, Michigan, and how the company was the primary economic and social hub of the town. He points out that Flint is the place where the 1937 Flint Sit-Down Strike occurred, resulting in the birth of the United Auto Workers. He reveals that his heroes were the Flint natives who had escaped the life in GM's factories, including the members of Grand Funk Railroad, Casey Kasem, the spouses of Zubin Mehta (Nancy Kovack) and Don Knotts, and \\"Flint's most famous native son,\\" game show host Bob Eubanks.Initially, he achieves his dream of avoiding the dreary tradition of blue-collared factory life that lays for the majority of the population of Flint; by moving to California and working for a magazine in San Francisco, but this venture fails for him and he ultimately travels back to Flint. As he returns (in 1985), General Motors announces the layoffs of thousands of Flint auto workers, the jobs of whom will go to cheaper labor when the plant relocates to Mexico. GM makes this announcement even though the company is (according to Moore) experiencing record profits.Disguised as a TV journalist from Toledo, Ohio, Moore interviews some auto workers in Flint and discovers their strong antipathy to General Motors chairman Roger B.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\".

He's not a secret agent, his job is to read, and he and his co-workers at the American Literary Historical Society read everything; books, comics, magazines, and they scan everything into a database to be cross-checked against real CIA operations. On a rainy December morning it's business as usual, so no one notices the non-descript man sitting in plain sedan across the street from Joe's building, checking off names of every employee as they enter.Inside, Joe looks for an answer to a letter he'd sent to the main CIA office at Langley. He has a theory about connections he's noticed between operations in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and other locations around the world, but so far there's no response. Noon approaches, and it's his turn to go out for lunch. Since it's still raining, he ducks out the basement door (which is against regulations) and cuts through several back alleys to the deli. Meanwhile, the sedan out front quietly pulls away after signaling to 3 men (one is a mailman) waiting in the street. They move in with quiet determination and knock on the front door. The mailman stands in view of the camera while the other two wait behind him.At the deli around the block, Joe picks up lunch for the others and then runs back. Since the rain has stopped, he goes to the front door, and buzzes the security intercom to be let in, but gets no answer. Pushing on the door, he finds it is unlocked, which it never is. Inside he finds a scene of carnage. Everyone has been murdered, shot to death in the few minutes he has been gone.

In Week 6, the Redskins played on the road for the second consecutive Sunday, this time against the 4-1 New York Jets, who had held three of their first four opponents to 14 points or less and were coming off of their bye week. Washington punted after going three-and-out on their first possession of the game. They were quickly back on offense, however, as Jets receiver Eric Decker was stripped by Bashaud Breeland at the Jets' 37-yard-line. After driving down to the 2-yard-line, Washington scored on a Kirk Cousins touchdown pass to Pierre Gar&#231;on, thanks to an uncharacteristic coverage error by former All-Pro cornerback Darrelle Revis. New York's first four plays on the next drive all involved running back Chris Ivory, and gained 33 yards. Quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick then threw a 35-yard pass to Eric Decker, and Ivory punched it in for the tying score two plays later. The Jets' stingy defense held the Redskins in check on their next drive, forcing another punt to end the first quarter. Chris Ivory then energized the raucous New York crowd with a 54-yard run to just outside the Redskins' 20, but the drive stalled and placekicker Nick Folk tacked on three more points, giving New York a 10-7 lead. Three punts followed, two by Washington and one by New York, before Breeland forced and recovered his second fumble of the game, this one off of 5-time Pro Bowler and former All-Pro receiver Brandon Marshall. With a short field, Cousins and the Redskins gained 19 yards, and Redskins kicker Dustin Hopkins booted a career-long 54-yard field goal to tie the game at 10-10 with just over two minutes remaining in the first half. Fitzpatrick led the Jets into Redskins territory with three short passes that gained 32 yards, before being intercepted by Breeland at the Washington 20-yard-line, Breeland's third turnover recovery of the half. Six plays and three timeouts later, Hopkins converted a 30-yard field goal to give the visiting Redskins a 13-10 halftime lead. On the first New York drive of the second half, back-to-back plays by Ivory carried the Jets across midfield, and the game was quickly tied again thanks to a Nick Folk field goal. After a Jets punt and an Alfred Morris 2-yard run, Cousins was intercepted by Revis, who returned the ball to the Redskins' 18-yard line. Fitzpatrick, not normally known as a particularly mobile quarterback, saw a hole in the defense and scored an 18-yard rushing touchdown on the very next play. Washington had gone from a 3-point lead to a 7-point deficit in a span of only five plays, and now trailed 20-13. The turnover also kept alive Cousins' streak of having thrown an interception in every road game of his career. The next Redskins drive, a three-and-out, did nothing to help them regain the momentum, nor did the 14-yard Marshall catch, 18-yard Zac Stacy run, or 35-yard touchdown reception, also by Marshall, on the next Jets drive. Badly hoping to get themselves back in the game, the Redskins called a deep pass to former Duke University receiver Jamison Crowder, but Jets safety Marcus Gilchrist intercepted the ball for Cousins' second turnover of the game. New York continued to pile up big plays, as well, with a 32-yard Ivory run to start the drive, and two third-down conversions totaling 28 yards. Fitzpatrick capitalized on those conversions, and threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Decker, wrapping up a 21-0 third quarter that resulted in a 34-13 Jets lead. Still reeling with 11 minutes left, Washington desperately tried to mount a comeback, engineering a 59-yard drive that resulted in no points, due to an incomplete pass on 4th-and-1 from the Jets 2-yard-line. They ended up scoring later in the fourth quarter, but not on offense; undrafted rookie Rashad Ross blocked a Jets punt and recovered it in the endzone, which provided the game's final score of 34-20. The hometown New York Jets improved to a surprising 5-1, already surpassing their win total from the entire 2014 season. The Washington Redskins dropped to 2-4 on the season with the loss, and 0-3 on the road. In each of their four losses, Cousins had thrown 2 interceptions; he had thrown none in the two victories. Murmurs calling for coach Jay Gruden to be fired had begun to escalate. Answer this question: How many yards difference was there between Ryan Fitzpatrick's rushing touchdown and his touchdown pass to Eric Decker?","completion":"To find the difference in yards between Ryan Fitzpatrick's rushing touchdown and his touchdown pass to Eric Decker, we need to first identify the yards for each event in the given text. 1. It's mentioned that Fitzpatrick scored an 18-yard rushing touchdown after Cousins was intercepted by Revis: \\"Fitzpatrick, not normally known as a particularly mobile quarterback, saw a hole in the defense and scored an 18-yard rushing touchdown on the very next play.\\" 2. Later, it's mentioned that Fitzpatrick threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Decker: \\"Fitzpatrick capitalized on those conversions, and threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Decker...\\" Now, to find the difference between the two touchdowns, we subtract the Decker's 2-yard touchdown from Fitzpatrick's 18-yard rushing touchdown. 18 (Fitzpatrick's rushing touchdown) - 2 (Decker's touchdown pass) = 16 yards There was a 16-yard difference between Ryan Fitzpatrick's rushing touchdown and his touchdown pass to Eric Decker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement provided shares essential details about the organization, such as its purpose, General Secretary, and President, but does not provide any information about its stability, financial health, or potential challenges. In order to evaluate whether the BFDA will last for a significant period, we would need to consider factors such as: 1. Membership size and growth: A healthy organization should have a substantial and growing number of registered members. By analyzing membership statistics and trends, one can deduce the current standing and projected future of the organization. 2. Financial sustainability: An organization must maintain sufficient financial resources to support its activities and meet its objectives. This could include membership fees, sponsorships, and partnerships with other organizations in the film industry. If the BFDA is struggling financially, it may face difficulties in continuing its activities over the long term. 3. External factors: The overall health of the film industry in Bangladesh may influence the BFDA's future prospects. Economic stability, government policy, and audience preferences can either bolster or weaken the industry, subsequently affecting the association's longevity. 4. Internal management and operations: The BFDA's leadership and decision-making process can significantly impact its success and sustainability. Competent leaders who effectively govern the organization, communicate with members, and carry out relevant activities contribute to the association's longevity. 5. Goals and objectives: An organization must have clear and achievable goals reflecting its mission and vision. The BFDA's ability to meet these objectives will determine its relevance and capability to endure as a trade body for film directors in Bangladesh.

A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank.

She is more or less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than her granddaughter? Text: Breast cancer is rare in teens but becomes more common as females get older. The answer is:","completion":"Jolene's grandmother is more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than her granddaughter. According to the provided text, breast cancer is rare in teens, but its prevalence increases as females age. Since Jolene's grandmother has just turned 66 years old, she falls in an older age group where the likelihood of developing breast cancer is higher compared to younger individuals like her granddaughter. There are various reasons as to why the risk of breast cancer increases with age. One of the primary factors is hormonal changes that affect the body as it ages. Women experience hormonal fluctuations throughout their lives, particularly during puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, leading to an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Moreover, as a woman gets older, her cumulative lifetime exposure to estrogen increases, which has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. Another reason is the gradual accumulation of genetic and cellular damage over time. As cells divide and grow, the chance of genetic mutations increases. When the body's repair and defense mechanisms slow down or become less effective, some of these damaged cells may transform into cancerous cells. In addition, lifestyle and environmental factors, such as exposure to carcinogenic substances, can also build up over time and contribute to an increased risk of breast cancer. It is important to acknowledge, however, that being more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer in older age does not imply that Jolene's grandmother will get breast cancer; it only refers to a higher likelihood compared to her younger granddaughter. Regular screenings, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and keeping up-to-date with any new recommendations from healthcare professionals are essential for Jolene's grandmother to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. During World War II, the United Kingdom had to cope with widespread food shortages and rationing that left sugar in short supply and chocolate almost unheard of. Which made Nazi boobytrap chocholate bombs all the more insulting, as Nick Higham reports for BBC News. Drawings of exploding candy bars, bombs disguised as cans of motor oil and other “unpleasant weapons” were recently rediscovered after 70 years, writes Higham. Intended to be used as a warning to British forces looking to take the bite out of booby traps, the drawings give an intriguing glimpse into the world of WWII espionage. 'Chocolate bomb' among WW2 boobytraps http://t.co/LDD7Lyzkb7 — BBC News (UK) (@BBCNews) September 30, 2015 The drawings of these odd German weapons were made by a man named Laurence Fish who worked for MI5's counter-sabotage unit. They were meant as a field guide to German booby traps, to teach agents how to diffuse these strange bombs if they encountereted them. Fish’s widow discovered 25 of the drawings after her husband’s death, but they were put in storage until they were recently discovered by the daughter of Victor Rothschild, who commissioned the drawings. (Gloustershire Echo has more information about their recovery.) Though a plot to kill Winston Churchill using the cruel candy has been known since a secret letter was uncovered in 2009, the drawings have not been made public until now. Not to be outdone by a few bombs, the British engaged in several ingenious acts of espionage and deception during the war. But it wasn’t all cool booby traps and clever ruses. The Brits’ ultimate act of trickery was one that occurred in plain sight — Operation Fortitude, a huge fake army made of inflatables and wood that diverted Axis attention from key landing sites that would enable the Allies to land at Normandy and take back Europe. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Laurence Fish was recruited by MI5 to design hidden booby trap bombs during the war Drawings of wartime boobytrap bombs, including an exploding chocolate bar and devices intended to sink ships, have been rediscovered after 70 years. The drawings were made by a young artist called Laurence Fish for MI5's counter-sabotage unit. There is an incendiary bomb designed as a Thermos flask, an army mess tin with a bomb hidden beneath the bangers and mash, and a high-explosive device concealed in a can of motor oil. There is a magnetic limpet mine for a ship's hull which explodes when detached. And there are timing devices ranging from the highly complex to the remarkably simple - like a test tube full of dried peas which expand as they absorb water and push two contacts together. All were unpleasant weapons dreamt up by German sabotage experts to spread havoc among their British enemies. The exploding chocolate bar, it is rumoured, was intended as part of an assassination attempt on Winston Churchill - though how it was supposed to reach him, and how the Germans might ensure that it was Churchill himself who tried to break off a slab, rather than a member of his family or his staff, isn't clear. Image copyright Antony Thompson/TWN Image caption One of Fish's drawings shows an Army mess tin adapted for nefarious purposes The 25 drawings, exquisite examples of 1940s draughtsmanship, were commissioned from Laurence Fish by Victor Rothschild. Rothschild and his secretary (later his wife) made up two-thirds of MI5's tiny counter-sabotage unit. The third member was a seconded police detective inspector, Donald Fish. When Rothschild was looking for someone to document the disguised and booby-trapped devices he was uncovering, Fish suggested his son, a self-taught draughstman who had learnt his trade before the war working for Alvis cars. 'Ingenious' The idea was that the drawings would serve as a kind of manual for anyone who had to defuse similar devices. And there were plenty of them. The historian Nigel West, who has written several books on espionage, says: \\"The Germans during the Second World War were very keen on destroying ships and their cargoes leaving neutral ports for the United Kingdom. \\"The idea was to starve Britain into submission. And they created some very ingenious devices which could be smuggled aboard ships and placed in the cargo holds with long-term timers: they wanted the ships to catch fire or to sink whilst out at sea.\\" Image copyright Antony Thompson/TWN Image caption Another of the boobytrap devices documented was a motor oil can with an explosive inside Rothschild was a larger-than-life character, a scientist and self-appointed expert on many things, who as the fourth Baron Rothschild later became head of Prime Minister Edward Heath's pioneering Think Tank. He was also brave. He won the George Medal for defusing a booby-trap device concealed by the Germans in a consignment of onions which had come by ship from Spain via Gibraltar. A Royal Navy lieutenant had lost an arm and an eye tackling a similar device. Rothschild gave a running commentary over a field telephone as he worked, so that his secretary could take notes and keep a record of every step he took, in case something else went wrong. 'Amazing' partnership \\"Rothschild was immensely generous with his family's money,\\" says Nigel West. \\"He didn't draw a salary; he almost certainly paid Fish for the illustrations himself; he made his family house up at Tring available to MI5 officers who were bombed out of their houses in central London. \\"And when MI5 needed an office in Paris upon the liberation, Victor just simply made available one of his mansions.\\" Rothschild, who was a lieutenant colonel, commissioned drawings from Laurence Fish, a humble aircraftsman, via letters stamped \\"Secret\\". They show evidence of a close working relationship. \\"They got on so well together,\\" says Fish's widow, Jean Bray. \\"It was an amazing combination. \\"Rothschild had very great respect for Laurence... I don't know why, but it worked well.\\" Image copyright Antony Thompson/TWN Image caption The Germans hoped to starve Britain into submission by destroying supply ships Fish kept the letters. But the drawings vanished. Rothschild had his favourite framed and hung it on the wall of his study. A couple of others were known from photographs. Otherwise, nothing. Then a few weeks ago, members of the Rothschild family were clearing out their house in Suffolk when they discovered a sheaf of drawings in \\"deep storage\\" in a chest of drawers. Rothschild's daughter Victoria realised what they were and got in touch with Jean. Rotating disc In the 1950s and onwards Laurence became a successful poster artist, graphic designer and landscape painter, putting his wartime work behind him. \\"It was interesting work obviously,\\" Jean told me, \\"and it must have been very concentrated work, but he wasn't going to make any money out of it so as soon as the war was over he'd got to do something that earned him a penny.\\" In her husband's old studio at the top of their home in the pretty Gloucestershire village of Winchcombe she showed me the pile of drawings, carefully wrapped in brown paper, cardboard and tissue paper, that Victoria Rothschild Gray had sent her. The exploding chocolate bar may be the most famous, but Jean's personal favourite is an exceptionally intricate 21-day timer involving a rotating disc. At the top, it says, in especially bold letters, \\"Do not unscrew here.\\" At the bottom, equally bold, are the words: \\"Unscrew here first.\\" Now Jean hopes that a museum or archive will agree to take the pictures: freehand precision drawings made long before the age of computer-aided design, and a fascinating record of fiendish wartime ingenuity ||||| A Nazi plot to kill Sir Winston Churchill with a bar of exploding chocolate during the Second World War has been revealed in historic papers. Giving a new meaning to the dessert name “death by chocolate”, Adolf Hitler’s bomb makers coated explosive devices with a thin layer of rich dark chocolate, then packaged it in expensive-looking black and gold paper. The Germans apparently planned to use secret agents working in Britain to discreetly place the bars - branded as Peters Chocolate - among other luxury items taken into the dining room used by the War Cabinet during the conflict. The lethal slabs of confection were packed with enough explosives to kill anyone within several metres. But the plot was foiled by British spies who discovered the chocolate was being made and tipped off one of MI5’s most senior intelligence chiefs, Lord Victor Rothschild, before the wartime prime minister’s life could be endangered. Lord Rothschild, a scientist in peace time as well as a key member of the Rothschild banking family, immediately typed a letter to a talented illustrator seconded to his unit, asking him to draw poster-size images of the chocolate to warn the public to be on the look-out. His letter to the artist, Laurence Fish, is dated May 4, 1943 and was written from his secret bunker in Parliament Street, London. It was unearthed by Mr Fish's wife, journalist Jean Bray, as she sorted through his possessions after the artist's death at the age of 89 in 2009. The letter, marked \\"secret\\", reads: “Dear Fish, I wonder if you could do a drawing for me of an explosive slab of chocolate. “We have received information that the enemy are using pound slabs of chocolate which are made of steel with a very thin covering of real chocolate. “Inside there is high explosive and some form of delay mechanism…When you break off a piece of chocolate at one end in the normal way, instead of it falling away, a piece of canvas is revealed stuck into the middle of the piece which has been broken off and a ticking into the middle of the remainder of the slab.” The letter explained how the mechanism would be activated when the piece of chocolate was pulled sharply, which would also pull the canvas, and Lord Rothschild said he was enclosing a “very poor sketch” done by someone who had seen one of the bars. He asked the artist to indicate in the text on his drawing that a bomb would go off seven seconds after the piece of chocolate and attached canvas was pulled out. ||||| These drawings show the amazing array of booby trap bombs dreamed up by the Nazis to kill the British during WWII - which have been rediscovered after 70 years. The sketches were made for MI5's counter-sabotage unit after British spies obtained intelligence on a number of crafty devices being made by the Germans. Among the 25 drawings - many of them previously unseen - are an exploding chocolate bar intended to kill Winston Churchill and a bomb camouflaged as a Thermos flask. There is also an army mess tin with a bomb hidden behind the bangers and mash, a highly explosive device concealed in a can of motor oil and devices intended to sink ships. Drawings of both simple and complex timing devices - such as a test tube of dried peas which expand as they absorb water and push two contacts together - were also found. The artist was Laurence Fish, a humble aircraftsman who was commissioned to undertake the work by lieutenant colonel Victor Rothschild in letters stamped \\"secret\\". Fish's widow Jean Bray unearthed the letters - which were written from a secret bunker in London - as she sorted through his possessions after he died in 2009, aged 89. The drawings had never been seen publicly until a few weeks ago, when Rothschild's daughter, Victoria, found them when she was clearing out the family home in Suffolk. She discovered the sheaf of drawings in \\"deep storage\\" in a chest of drawers and, when she realised what they were, got in touch with Jean. Jean, 82, an archivist and former journalist living in Winchcombe, Glos., said: \\"I didn't know that the drawings existed. \\"He always kept the letters, but nobody knew what had happened to the drawings. We presumed that they had been destroyed or lost. \\"It was only this summer that they were discovered. \\"It was so exciting. There was a lot of excitement when people saw the letters, and we have been looking for the drawings since. \\"There are 25 which range in size from A4 to A1, which is pretty big. \\"Nowadays people would say these drawings are nothing and you could do it with a computer in seconds. \\"But there was no machinery or anything like that at the time. They are all hand drawn.\\" Laurence Fish, a self-taught draughtsman, was commissioned to do the drawings after his father, detective inspector Donald Fish, suggested him for the job. Donald Fish was part of the MI5 counter-sabotage unit, which had just three members - the other two being Rothschild and his secretary, who later became his wife. Rothschild had been looking for someone to draw the booby-trapped devices he was uncovering, and he quickly formed a close working relationship with the new artist. \\"They got on so well together,\\" said Jean, Fish's widow. \\"It was an amazing combination. Rothschild had very great respect for Laurence - I don't know why, but it worked well.\\" Rothschild, who later became head of Prime Minister Edward Heath's Think Tank, hung his favourite drawings in frames on the wall of his study. They are now all being kept in the old studio of the late artist, who became a successful graphic designer and landscape painter in the 1950s. Fish's most well-known drawing is that of the exploding chocolate bar, which is thought to have been intended for use in an assassination attempt on Winston Churchill. But Jean said her favourite is an intricate drawing of a 21-day timer involving a rotating disc, which has instructions reading, \\"do not unscrew here\\", and \\"unscrew here first\\".

In 1993, Winfrey hosted a rare prime-time interview with Michael Jackson, which became the fourth most-watched event in American television history as well as the most watched interview ever, with an audience of 36.5 million. On December 1, 2005, Winfrey appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote the new Broadway musical The Color Purple, of which she was a producer, joining the host for the first time in 16 years. The episode was hailed by some as the \\"television event of the decade\\" and helped Letterman attract his largest audience in more than 11 years: 13.45 million viewers. Although a much-rumored feud was said to have been the cause of the rift, both Winfrey and Letterman balked at such talk. \\"I want you to know, it's really over, whatever you thought was happening\\", said Winfrey. On September 10, 2007, Letterman made his first appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, as its season premiere was filmed in New York City. In 2006, rappers Ludacris, 50 Cent and Ice Cube criticized Winfrey for what they perceived as an anti-hip hop bias. In an interview with GQ magazine, Ludacris said that Winfrey gave him a \\"hard time\\" about his lyrics, and edited comments he made during an appearance on her show with the cast of the film Crash. He also said that he wasn't initially invited on the show with the rest of the cast. Winfrey responded by saying that she is opposed to rap lyrics that \\"marginalize women\\", but enjoys some artists, including Kanye West, who appeared on her show. She said she spoke with Ludacris backstage after his appearance to explain her position and said she understood that his music was for entertainment purposes, but that some of his listeners might take it literally. In September 2008, Winfrey received criticism after Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report reported that Winfrey refused to have Sarah Palin on her show, allegedly because of Winfrey's support for Barack Obama. Winfrey denied the report, maintaining that there never was a discussion regarding Palin's appearing on her show. She said that after she made public her support for Obama, she decided that she would not let her show be used as a platform for any of the candidates. Although Obama appeared twice on her show, those appearances were prior to his declaring himself a candidate. Winfrey added that Palin would make a fantastic guest and that she would love to have her on the show after the election, which she did on November 18, 2009. In 2009, Winfrey was criticized for allowing actress Suzanne Somers to appear on her show to discuss hormone treatments that are not accepted by mainstream medicine. Critics have also suggested that Winfrey is not tough enough when questioning celebrity guests or politicians whom she appears to like. Lisa de Moraes, a media columnist for The Washington Post, stated: \\"Oprah doesn't do follow-up questions unless you're an author who's embarrassed her by fabricating portions of a supposed memoir she's plugged for her book club.\\" Answer this question \\"Did she appear on his show more then once?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, Oprah Winfrey appeared on David Letterman's show more than once.

The history of Bank of America dates back to October 17, 1904, when Amadeo Pietro Giannini founded the Bank of Italy in San Francisco. The Bank of Italy served the needs of many immigrants settling in the United States at that time, providing services denied to them by the existing American banks which typically discriminated against them and often denied service to all but the wealthiest. Giannini was raised by his mother and stepfather Lorenzo Scatena, as his father was fatally shot over a pay dispute with an employee. When the 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck, Giannini was able to save all deposits out of the bank building and away from the fires. Because San Francisco's banks were in smoldering ruins and unable to open their vaults, Giannini was able to use the rescued funds to commence lending within a few days of the disaster. From a makeshift desk consisting of a few planks over two barrels, he lent money to those who wished to rebuild. Can we conclude that the organization that today is known as the bank of america did start out in america?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that the organization that is now known as Bank of America did indeed start out in America. The Bank of Italy, founded by Amadeo Pietro Giannini on October 17, 1904, in San Francisco, California, served as the foundation of what would eventually become Bank of America. The initial mission of the Bank of Italy was to provide financial services to immigrants and working-class individuals in the United States who were often discriminated against by traditional American banks. Over the years, the Bank of Italy underwent several transformations and mergers. In 1928, it merged with the Bank of America, Los Angeles, and shortly after, in 1929, the Bank of Italy changed its name to Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association. The bank continued to grow and expand throughout the 20th century, acquiring numerous other financial institutions along the way. By the 21st century, Bank of America had become one of the largest banking institutions in the United States and worldwide. Today, the corporation offers a wide range of financial services, including personal banking, credit cards, mortgages, investment advice, and more. Through its history of growth and acquisitions, the organization has maintained its roots in the United States, as its origins trace back to the early 20th-century Bank of Italy in San Francisco."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece.

Seat belts The best answer is D, seat belts, which have widely been recognized as an essential feature in vehicles for the sake of safety. While all the other options listed (A. windows, B. trunks, C. four wheels, and E. diesel engines) are components found in cars, none of them directly address the concern of safety as effectively as seat belts do. Seat belts are designed to secure passengers during a car crash or an abrupt stop, to prevent them from being ejected or experiencing potentially fatal injuries. The use of seat belts can greatly reduce the risk of death and serious injuries in vehicle accidents. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), seat belts saved an estimated 14,955 lives in the United States in 2017. The significance of seat belts was first recognized in the 1950s, when various research conducted by automotive engineers, such as Volvo's Nils Bohlin, demonstrated the lifesaving potential of seat belts. In 1959, Volvo became the first automaker to introduce three-point seat belts, which are now the standard in most vehicles. Since then, numerous countries have passed legislation requiring the installation of seat belts in vehicles and mandating their use by passengers. In the United States, for instance, seat belt laws began to be enacted on a state-by-state basis in the 1960s, with New York being the first state to pass a law requiring seat belt use in 1984. The effectiveness of seat belts becomes apparent when we look at the statistics. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seat belts reduce the risk of death for front-seat vehicle occupants by 45% and the risk of serious injury by 50%. Furthermore, the NHTSA estimates that between 1960 and 2012, seat belts saved over 329,000 lives. In conclusion, due to safety concerns, a law was passed that all cars must have seat belts. This life-saving device has significantly contributed to reducing the risk of death and injury in vehicular accidents and remains the most critical safety feature in modern vehicles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

M: One's in Munich, one's in Frankfurt and the other one's in Hamburg. F: Munich's supposed to be a very nice place. M: Yes it is, and it's also in a beautiful part of Germany, not far from the Alias. F: That would be great for the kids--they'd love to be able to go skiing at weekends!

F: It's a higher salary than the job in Frankfurt but lower than the one in Hamburg. The Hamburg job has the most responsibility.

M: Well, it's definitely higher than over here, but salaries are substantially higher, so we'd certainly be better off than we are now. F: And what about accommodation? M: Well, actually, flats are much cheaper to rent in towns like Munich, Frankfurt and Hamburg than they are here in London, so we'd be able to afford to live in a nice, spacious flat, I'd think. F: Mmm, that'd be nice! And do you know what the cultural facilities are like in these cities? M: In fact, they're quite good in all three.

Would \\"They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania .\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"A contingent fee with an attorney, often referred to as a contingency fee, is a payment agreement between the client and their legal representative, which depends upon the outcome of the case. In a contingency fee arrangement, the attorney agrees to represent the client without charging any upfront retainer fees or hourly rates. Instead, the attorney's compensation is based on a percentage of the settlement or monetary award that the client receives if they win their case. This type of fee arrangement is particularly common in personal injury cases, where the client might not have the financial resources to pay for an attorney upfront. Contingent fees provide clients with access to legal representation regardless of their financial situation, as the attorney takes the risk of not receiving payment if the case is unsuccessful. These fees motivate the attorney to achieve the best possible outcome for the client, as their compensation is directly tied to the results. In the context of Lithuania, the statement \\"They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania\\" is, indeed, a reasonable answer. Contingent fee arrangements are permitted and regulated by the Lithuanian Code of Civil Procedure and the Rules of Professional Conduct for Advocates in Lithuania. The specific regulations concerning contingent fee arrangements may vary depending on the type of legal representation and the specific circumstances of the case. However, it is crucial to note that there are certain restrictions and guidelines in place to ensure that clients are treated fairly and ethically. Attorneys are required to maintain transparency and disclose the terms of the contingent fee agreement in writing before accepting the case. Additionally, the percentage of the attorney's fee may be subject to limitations imposed by law or professional regulations. In summary, a contingent fee arrangement with an attorney is a payment agreement in which the attorney's fees depend on the successful resolution of the client's case. They are common in personal injury cases and allowed in Lithuania, subject to adherence to certain regulations and guidelines. The statement \\"They are also allowed in personal injury actions in Lithuania\\" is accurate, as long as the arrangement follows the local guidelines and restrictions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her 17-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn). Dawn is suspended for three days after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. She refuses to tell her parents or the school principal about the bullying, aware that it will only lead to worse bullying for herself.

Options: - flat - flat ground - downhill - straight - top Explain why a human would choose \\"flat ground\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"flat ground\\" as the answer to the question above because in the given scenario, Susan is experiencing difficulty climbing the slopes. This difficulty could be due to the steep incline, uneven terrain, or physically demanding nature of climbing uphill. Flat ground provides a more stable and manageable surface for walking or standing, allowing Susan to catch her breath and exert less effort in comparison to the slopes. While the other options may seem plausible at first, they are less likely to be chosen: - \\"Flat\\" could be open to interpretation, but without context like \\"ground,\\" it is less specific and clear; - \\"Downhill\\" might appear as an alternative to going uphill, but it can still be challenging due to the need for balance and possible strain on knees and ankles; - \\"Straight\\" isn't the best answer because it doesn't necessarily imply an easier path, a straight path could still be sloped; - \\"Top\\" might indicate reaching the end or peak of the climb, but it does not directly address Susan's current wish for an easier time climbing. Hence, \\"flat ground\\" is the most appropriate and logical answer as it addresses Susan's desire to be on a more comfortable and less physically demanding surface."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Joe paid the detective after *he* delivered the final report on the case.","completion":"Yes, in the given sentence \\"the detective\\" and \\"he\\" refer to the same individual. To offer a thorough understanding, let's break down the sentence and focus on each of its components. The sentence states, \\"Joe paid the detective after *he* delivered the final report on the case.\\" Here, we can identify two main clauses: 1. Joe paid the detective 2. he delivered the final report on the case The actions or verbs in these clauses are \\"paid\\" (in the first clause) and \\"delivered\\" (in the second clause). The subject in the first clause is \\"Joe,\\" while the subject in the second clause is represented by the pronoun \\"he.\\" Now, when examining the context of the sentence and understanding the relationship between these clauses, it becomes apparent that the event of \\"paying the detective\\" occurred as a subsequent action following the other event: \\"delivering the final report on the case.\\" To be more precise, the detective performs the action \\"to deliver the final report on the case.\\" Consequently, Joe pays the detective for the service. With this context in mind, it is evident that the pronoun \\"he\\" in the second clause refers to \\"the detective\\" from the first clause. Both terms are representative of the same person, namely the detective, and describe the individual's actions throughout the sentence. In conclusion, in the sentence, \\"Joe paid the detective after *he* delivered the final report on the case,\\" both \\"the detective\\" and \\"he\\" do indeed point to the same individual, as it is a coherent and logical statement illustrating a sequence of events involving the detective."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Browns ended a 7-game away losing streak and improved to 2-2 with the win. For the fourth time this season, the Browns participated in a game that was decided by 3 or fewer points. It was also the fourth time in as many games that the winning score was produced with less than 2 minutes to go in the 4th quarter. The game was aggressive, with 14 penalties for 142 yards, and the ejection of the Titans' linebacker Derrick Morgan. The Titans dominated in the early minutes, scoring the first 14 points of the contest and leaping out to a 28-3 lead. Despite trailing by as many as 25 points in the second quarter, the Browns scored the final 26 points of the game while the Titans failed to score any points in the second half. Travis Benjamin caught the game-winning TD pass from Brian Hoyer with 69 seconds left in the game. The Browns' 25 point rally represented the largest comeback in franchise history and the largest comeback by a road team in NFL history.

Possible answers: * Yes * No Given those answer options, answer the question: Quinn waited an hour after work for John to get off so they could go home together. Given the question \\"How would you describe Quinn?\\", is \\"a jealous individual\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"Given the answer options \\"Yes\\" and \\"No,\\" to the question of whether describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" is valid based on the provided information, one may need to consider the following points: 1. The information provided states that Quinn waited an hour after work for John to get off so they could go home together. It does not specifically mention any sign of jealousy or actions motivated by jealousy on Quinn's part. 2. Quinn waiting for John to finish work could be due to various reasons other than jealousy. It could be a sign of friendship, companionship, or caring. 3. The context of the situation is also essential. If Quinn and John typically go home together or if one of them relies on the other for transportation, waiting an hour might be a practical solution and not necessarily related to jealousy. Based on the information provided, describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" does not seem like a valid conclusion. Without additional context or specific actions that demonstrate jealousy, the scenario presented appears to be neutral in nature, and other descriptive terms for Quinn may be more relevant or accurate. Now, considering whether \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" is the appropriate response: A \\"Yes\\" response would imply that describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" is valid based on the given information. However, as discussed earlier, the information provided does not necessarily suggest jealousy on Quinn's part. A \\"No\\" response would imply that describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" is not an accurate conclusion based on the provided information about the scenario. This response aligns more with the analysis conducted above and suggests that the scenario could be a result of alternative reasons that are not indicative of jealousy. To sum up, a \\"No\\" response appears to be the fitting answer when evaluating the validity of describing Quinn as \\"a jealous individual\\" based on the given information. There might be other reasons behind Quinn's actions, and without further evidence or context related to jealousy, it seems inappropriate to characterize Quinn as a jealous individual."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

If \\"A young man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\", can we conclude \\"A man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"A man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house\\" based on the original statement \\"A young man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\" Here's an analysis of how we can arrive at that conclusion. The original statement has four basic components: 1. The subject: A young man 2. The action: Jumps up off his skateboard 3. The location: On the street 4. The context: In front of a house The question wants us to examine the validity of the statement \\"A man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\" Let's break it down in a similar manner: 1. The subject: A man 2. The action: Jumps up off his skateboard 3. The location: On the street 4. The context: In front of a house Comparing the two statements, we can see that the actions, locations, and contexts are identical. The only difference is in the subject: \\"A young man\\" vs. \\"A man.\\" By analyzing the relationship between these two, we can determine if the conclusion is valid. A young man is, by definition, a male individual who is considered to be in the early period of his life. The term \\"man\\" refers to a male human being without any reference to age. Therefore, a young man falls under the broader category of \\"man.\\" If we had to express this in an explicit manner, the relationship could be represented as: All young men are men. Given that all young men are men, we can say that a statement involving a young man performing an action can also apply to a man in the broader sense. In this case, since the young man is jumping up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house, it would also be accurate to say that a man is jumping up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house. In conclusion, based on the original statement, we can accurately state that \\"A man jumps up off his skateboard on the street in front of a house.\\" This is because the subject \\"A young man\\" is a subset of \\"A man,\\" and the action, location, and context are all the same in both statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But , in the fifteenth century , only two of them were resident in Avignon ; the rest were functionaries of the Roman Curia in Sisteron .","completion":"While these two sentences from Wikipedia might at first glance appear to convey similar information, they are not the same in meaning. In the first sentence: \\"But in the fifteenth century, only two of them were resident in Sisteron, the others were officials of the Roman Curia in Avignon.\\" The sentence states that there are two individuals residing in Sisteron, with the remainder acting as officials of the Roman Curia in Avignon. The primary focus of this sentence is on the two individuals in Sisteron, and it establishes the remaining group as being connected to the Roman Curia in Avignon. This sentence highlights Sisteron as the location where only two individuals are residing, implying that the main concentration of the group is in Avignon. In the second sentence: \\"But, in the fifteenth century, only two of them were resident in Avignon; the rest were functionaries of the Roman Curia in Sisteron.\\" This sentence flips the locations mentioned in the first sentence. In this case, only two individuals reside in Avignon, while the rest serve as functionaries of the Roman Curia in Sisteron. This sentence emphasizes Avignon as the location with minimal representation, implying that Sisteron is where the majority of the group is found. In summary, these two sentences express different meanings in terms of the locations and roles associated with the individuals mentioned. The first sentence establishes two residents in Sisteron with the rest in Avignon, while the second sentence reverses it, stating that two residents are in Avignon and the remaining are in Sisteron.

Barry is perfectly creepy and believable.\\" can be perceived as a mixture of positive and negative emotions. On the positive side, the sentiment is one of appreciation towards Raymond J. Barry's acting skills and the fact that he is \\"believable\\" in his role. This suggests that the speaker thinks that the actor is successful in executing his part, convincingly portraying the character, and adapting well in the specific context. Being \\"believable\\" is an important asset for an actor, as it draws the audience into the story and creates an immersive experience. Therefore, this part of the sentiment communicates praise and admiration for Raymond J. Barry's talent and performance. On the other hand, the sentiment also conveys negative emotions, particularly through the use of the term \\"creepy.\\" This suggests that the actor's portrayal of a character goes beyond just being convincing and into something that evokes feelings of uneasiness, fear, or discomfort in the audience. A \\"creepy\\" character is usually associated with antagonists, villains, or morally ambiguous roles that are meant to elicit a sense of dread or revulsion. In this context, it is essential to remember that portraying a \\"creepy\\" character is not inherently a negative thing for an actor, as it demonstrates versatility in embodying different roles, and the ability to evoke strong emotions from the audience. To sum up, the sentiment of the sentence can be perceived as a blended expression of emotions; acknowledging the actor's successful and impressive performance in conveying a creepy, believable character, while also hinting at the unsettling and fear-provoking nature of the role itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Five months after its release, the album was certified Gold by the RIAA. By March 2005, the album had sold 531,000 copies in the United States. Hypothesis: Baby Bash will release an album that is more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew.","completion":"Drawing the hypothesis that Baby Bash will release an album that is more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew relies on various factors and assumptions. While it is possible that he could release a more successful album, we must consider different aspects contributing to the potential success of future albums. 1. Current popularity and fan base: Tha Smokin' Nephew was Baby Bash's first major label studio album, and it helped him gain recognition and a following. Depending on how Baby Bash continues to cultivate his fan base, his growing popularity could contribute to the success of his future albums. If he can maintain or increase his current level of popularity, it increases the likelihood of a more successful album release. 2. Changes in music preferences: Music preferences and trends change over time. As an artist, Baby Bash must adapt and evolve his music style to stay relevant in a competitive industry. Should his future releases fit well within the prevalent tastes of his targeted demographic, there is a higher chance of surpassing the success of Tha Smokin' Nephew. 3. Marketing strategies: A significant factor in the success of an album is its marketing and promotion. Record labels are often responsible for promotions and album releases, and their strategies can directly impact an artist's success. If Baby Bash's label or management devises a more effective marketing plan for his future albums, those releases stand a better chance of being more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew. 4. Collaborations and features: Collaborating with other well-established artists can lead to increased exposure and an artist's music gaining a broader audience. If Baby Bash works with renowned artists and producers in the future, it could boost the likelihood of his albums surpassing the success of Tha Smokin' Nephew. 5. Quality and consistency: The quality of the music in an album plays a crucial role in its success. Baby Bash must continue to improve his craft, create compelling music, and stay consistent with his output. If his future albums maintain a high level of quality, they have a higher chance of being more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew. Taking all of these factors into account, it is possible to hypothesize that Baby Bash could release an album that is more successful than Tha Smokin' Nephew. However, this hypothesis relies on assumptions about the artist's growth, the music industry's dynamics, marketing strategies, and continued relevance in the ever-changing landscape of popular music."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries.They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa.The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor .The diseased children are usually from one to four years old.As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body.The skin changes colour and may break out in open sores.The hair changes colour and starts to fall out.The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time.Stomach liquids are no longer produced.

In many parts of Africa, where the disease is prevalent, there is a lack of awareness and understanding of the importance of a balanced diet, particularly with regard to protein intake. As a result, the symptoms of kwashiorkor, such as a swollen stomach, changes in skin color, open sores, hair loss, and lethargy, can be misidentified as signs of other illnesses or malnutrition. This makes it challenging for medical professionals to diagnose and treat kwashiorkor effectively, leading to a higher prevalence of the disease among young children aged one to four years old. The key to addressing kwashiorkor is to educate communities on the importance of protein-rich foods like milk and meat to ensure proper nutrition and prevent the onset of this debilitating illness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Question: how many states have open carry gun laws I found the following answer on Google: The gun rights community has been mixed in its response. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the given answer does not directly answer the question regarding the number of states with open carry gun laws. To provide you with a more detailed and long answer to the question, let's first discuss what open carry gun laws are. Open carry refers to the legal act of carrying a firearm openly in public. In the United States, the open carry gun laws vary from state to state. Some states have permissive open carry laws, which means individuals can openly carry firearms without a permit or license. Other states have more restrictive open carry laws, requiring licenses or permits to carry firearms openly, or prohibiting open carry entirely. As of now, 45 states in the United States allow some form of open carry. However, it is important to keep in mind that even within these states, the laws and regulations may differ regarding where and how firearms can be openly carried. Here's a breakdown of the open carry laws in the United States: 1. Permissive open carry states (no permit required): In these states, individuals can carry openly without any specific permit or license. There are 31 states in this category, including Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, and West Virginia. 2. Licensed open carry states (permit required): In these states, individuals must obtain a permit or license before they can carry firearms openly. There are currently 14 states with licensed open carry laws, including Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming. 3. Anomalous open carry states: In these two states (North Carolina and New Mexico), open carry is permitted in certain situations, but not as a blanket rule. They often have specific regulations or restrictions based on the type of firearm, location, or circumstances. 4. Non-permissive open carry states (prohibited): In these four states and the District of Columbia, open carry is generally prohibited, with some exceptions for law enforcement or other specified circumstances. The states in this category are California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Washington D.C. It is essential to understand that these classifications are subject to change as laws are frequently amended or new legislation is passed. Always consult up-to-date state and local laws before openly carrying a firearm. Moreover, concealed carry laws may differ from open carry, so it's necessary to be aware of these distinctions and abide by the specific laws in each state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Beaufort County, a rural coastal community located about 120 miles east of Raleigh, North Carolina, is a community with \\"some unique needs,\\" Washington High School's Principal Misty Walker tells PEOPLE. According , 21 percent of residents in Beaufort County are living below the poverty level. \\"What we're learning is that if we're not helping meet the basic needs of our students, it's very difficult for our students to focus on academics,\\" Walker says. \\"There have been times when students come up to me in the hallways and they would ask me if I had toothpaste because they didn't have any toothpaste at home,\\" she says, explaining that she would go out and purchase toothpaste, toothbrushes and dental floss for students who asked for it. She shared this experience with Bright Futures Beaufort County, a local affiliate of , a non-profit organization that helps encourage community partnerships for schools to benefit children and young people. When they heard about this, Bright Futures helped the school foster a partnership with First South Bank to establish their first \\"closet\\" focused on hygiene. At the same time, Walker explains, the student government association was trying to find ways to help serve their school community and the needs of students. The school government, administration and Bright Futures joined forces at the beginning of the school year to start their in-school food pantry, focused on supplying students with \\"teen-friendly\\" foods (like cereal bars, Pop-Tarts and foods that don't require a can opener or extensive cooking equipment) in an anonymous and private environment. The food pantry is stocked with goods raised through school food drives, donations gathered by churches (including Old Fort Church of Christ in Washington, North Carolina, which brought in 10 bags of food for the pantry). Student can access the food pantry (as well as their hygiene, school supply and clothing closets) by coming to a guidance counselor or school administrator and asking for help. The counselor will then take the student to the closets to \\"shop\\" for what they want. The student's information is never taken down and no one keeps a written record of what each student takes. Washington High School's clothing closet Misty Walker / Washington High School \\"It is completely anonymous,\\" Walker says. \\"So that when students have needs, they come and they ask and we meet them. I could not tell you all the students who have been helped through this process because there is nowhere where there is some master list. \\"What's interesting is that sometimes there's a notion that students may want to be greedy and take a lot,\\" she says about their take-what-you-want ethos. \\"And what we find is that our students are very judicious in what they take and we actually have to encourage them to take more. \\"For example, if there's a weekend coming up, if we have a student who comes in on Friday with a need we want to make certain that they have something not just for Friday night, but also something that will help them get through until Monday.\\" One of the main problems that the school's food pantry wanted to solve was making sure that the student was actually getting the food that they need. After working with a Backpack Buddy program – which packs up food and supplies for elementary and middle school students to take home – Walker noticed that some of the food was getting consumed before it arrived home with the student. \\"What would happen is when food would go home in the backpacks and when students would get on the bus, another kid might actually take it and go through it and take what they wanted,\\" she explains. Washington High School's hygiene and school supply closet Misty Walker / Washington High School In another situation, Walker explained that she went to a food pantry to get food for one young female student and later found out that there were \\"lots of extended family members\\" living at her home. \\"So, even though you look at the box of food and think that should be a great help, based upon the number of people that are in the home, it doesn't go very far,\\" she says. Walker notes that while she can't measure exactly how many people have used their closest and pantry, she estimates it has helped \\"between 10 and 15 percent\\" of the students. \\"[The pantry] has only been active for about six weeks now,\\" she says \\"But what we're seeing is an increase in self-esteem. And students who have needs, they are being met. They know that since we're doing it on such an anonymous basis, they don't have to worry about anyone talking about them about getting their needs met because no one ever knows.\\" Having basic needs met and building up trust between student in need and school administrators also allows Walker and her colleagues to open a dialogue with the students. \\"Once we develop a relationship with this student and we know that they have this basic need that needs to be met then that leads into other conversations,\\" she explains. \\"Like, 'What do you want to do after high school? What are your goals after high school?' And of course that transitions into the conversation of, 'Well, how are you doing in your classes right now? Do you need any help in your classes right now? Do you need to stay after school to get some help?' And we do what we can to help them succeed. So those types of conversations are critical to help and support that child.\\" While the pantry is focused on prepackaged and canned food at the moment, the food pantry team hopes to expand into supplying fresh produce directly from the school's horticulture program. \\"We're probably a year away from being able to do that,\\" she admits. \\"That is our long-term goal to get where we can also supplement with fresh fruits and fresh vegetables.\\" With holiday breaks coming up, the school is also trying to assess how to make sure needs are being met when students aren't actually at school. Currently, the school is planning on working with individual students and making sure they take home additional food from the pantry to cover their time off. However, they are still trying to plan what to do for summer break. \\"Our greatest challenge we will have during the summer is is transportation for our students to get back and forth,\\" Walker says. \\"And that we don't quite have the solution for yet.\\" Walker says that the school hasn't set up a GoFundMe page yet to raise money but that anyone looking to make a donation – be it financial or physical goods – can do so . People can also make donations directly to Bright Future Beaufort County through the Washington-Beaufort County Chamber of Commerce.

Answer: He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem (on Manhattan island), and bought additional tracts from the local tribes. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: Pieter Bronck, a Swedish immigrant, acquired his land from two primary sources: the Dutch West India Company and the local Native American tribes in the region known today as the Bronx, New York. In the early 17th century, the Dutch West India Company was a major player in the colonization and settlement of the Americas. The company controlled vast areas of land in North and South America, as well as the Caribbean, through a series of charter agreements with the Dutch government. The company's main purpose was to control trade, particularly in furs, as well as to expand the territory governed by the Dutch. In this capacity, the company leased land to settlers, traders, and farmers, including Pieter Bronck. Pieter Bronck arrived in New Amsterdam (present-day New York City) in 1639. In the early 1640s, he leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem, on Manhattan Island, hence, the name \\"Bronck's Land.\\" This area lies in present-day Mott Haven and Port Morris neighborhoods in the South Bronx. Aside from leasing land from the Dutch West India Company, Bronck also secured additional tracts of land through purchases from the local Native American tribes. During this period, it was customary for European settlers to negotiate land deals directly with the indigenous people, who were the original inhabitants of the region. In 1641, Bronck purchased around 500 acres of land from the local Lenape Native American tribes, chiefs Ranaqua and Tackamuck. These tracts were located in the area that is now known as the Bronx. The purchased land extended from the Harlem River to the Aquahung River, which today is called the Bronx River. Bronck's land acquisitions made him one of the first European landowners in the Bronx, and it was this connection that eventually led to the borough being named after him. In conclusion, Pieter Bronck got his land from two entities: the Dutch West India Company, from whom he leased land on the neck of the mainland north of Harlem, and the local Native American tribes, primarily Lenape, from whom he purchased additional tracts of land. These transactions helped to establish Bronck as a prominent figure in the early Dutch period of New York history and set the stage for his legacy as the namesake of the borough of the Bronx."},{"prompt":"Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

I quickly got off the train in excitement taking in the view of the station like it was first time I had seen anything. We exited the station and took the trolley to get to our hotel. For breakfast, we had delicious, regional delicacies (among other things). They looked similar to crepes, but all I know is that it had a German name that I can’t remember. After we got situated in our hotel, we immediately headed off for the Mozart Plaza/Park. My family and I also visited other monuments that day: By the end of the day, our legs were worn out.

Next question: the contract that exists between the insurer and the insured?","completion":"The contract that exists between the insurer and the insured is called an insurance policy. To explain this, let's break down the steps involved in creating and understanding this contract: 1. Identifying the parties involved: In an insurance policy, there are two primary parties: the insurer and the insured. The insurer is the insurance company providing coverage, and the insured is the individual or entity receiving coverage. 2. Assessing the risk: Before an insurance policy is issued, the insurer will assess the risk associated with the applicant (the insured). This assessment helps the insurer determine the likelihood of a claim being filed, which factors into the cost of the policy. 3. Determining the premium: The insurer will set a price for the insurance policy, known as the premium. This is the amount the insured must pay to maintain their coverage. Premiums can be paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. 4. Defining the policy term: Insurance policies have a specified term, which is the period during which coverage is active. The policy term can be stated in months or years, and it outlines the duration and expiration date of the coverage. 5. Establishing coverage limits: The insurance policy will outline the limits of coverage, which is the maximum amount the insurer will pay out in the event of a claim. Limits can be per occurrence or aggregated over the policy term. 6. Defining exclusions: Each insurance policy has certain exclusions, which are situations or events that the policy specifically does not cover. These will be outlined in the policy document. 7. Describing conditions and duties: The insurance policy will include various conditions that the insured must meet to maintain their coverage. Additionally, the policy will describe duties the insured must perform in the event of a claim. 8. Issuing the policy: Once the insurer and insured have agreed upon the terms of the policy, the insurer will issue the policy to the insured. The policy will typically be a written document that both parties sign, signifying their agreement to the policy's terms. 9. Filing claims and receiving benefits: If the insured experiences a loss or event covered by the policy, they must file a claim with the insurer. The insurer will then review the claim and, if approved, provide the benefits as outlined in the policy. 10. Renewal and adjustments: At the end of the policy term, the insurer and insured may discuss renewal and any necessary adjustments to the policy's terms or coverage. This can include changes to the premium, policy limits, or exclusions. In summary, the contract between an insurer and insured is known as an insurance policy. It establishes the terms, coverage, and obligations for both parties involved and serves as the foundation for their insurance relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Option 1 asserts that the hypothesis is true. The premise itself raises the question of why a certain action or approach was not taken in the past, aligning with the hypothesis' intent to investigate the reasons for not using a particular method or solution earlier. There could be various reasons why something was not done in the past, such as limited resources, lack of knowledge, technological barriers, or social and cultural constraints. Acknowledging these factors and understanding how they have evolved over time can help us draw a link between the premise and the hypothesis. Therefore, in this context, we can conclude that there is evidence supporting the hypothesis' truth. Option 2 claims that it is not possible to tell if the hypothesis is true. While unclear situations and lack of information might sometimes prevent us from drawing definitive conclusions, the given premise already questions why a certain thing was not done in the past. This expressed curiosity allows us to infer that there is, at least to some degree, a basis for the hypothesis' investigation. Thus, this option appears to carry less weight in the context of the question. Option 3 proposes that the hypothesis is not true. This option would be more applicable if there was evidence contradicting the hypothesis or indicating that the action, method, or solution in question had already been implemented twenty years ago. However, the premise itself is centered on understanding why something was not done in the past, which aligns with the hypothesis rather than refutes it. As a result, this option does not seem relevant to the question. In conclusion, based on the premise “but how come we weren't doing this say twenty years ago you know,” it is reasonable to assert that the hypothesis \\"but why did we not do this in the past\\" is true. Various factors and circumstances could have prevented the implementation of an idea or solution in the past, and understanding these can help to establish the hypothesis' validity.

Instead, it can be said that the Napa Valley Transportation Authority oversees and manages the VINE Transit system, while Transdev serves as the operator responsible for handling the day-to-day operations of the transit system. To provide a more detailed perspective on the roles of these organizations in relation to VINE Transit, it is essential to look at the responsibilities and functions associated with each entity. The Napa Valley Transportation Authority (NVTA) serves as the managing organization for VINE Transit and is responsible for a range of tasks associated with the transit system. This includes, but is not limited to: 1. Planning and development: NVTA creates long-term strategies and plans for improving and expanding the VINE Transit system in order to meet the public transportation needs of Napa County. 2. Policy-making and governance: NVTA establishes policies and regulations related to the functioning and operations of VINE Transit. This can include matters like fare structures, service hours, and operational guidelines. 3. Funding and budgeting: NVTA oversees the allocation of financial resources for VINE Transit, ensuring the transit system receives the necessary funding to provide safe, reliable, and efficient services to Napa County residents. 4. Monitoring and oversight: NVTA is responsible for tracking the performance and effectiveness of VINE Transit, ensuring that the system is meeting its goals and staying in compliance with established policies and regulations. On the other hand, Transdev is the contracted operator of VINE Transit, responsible for the day-to-day operations of the public transportation service. This means that Transdev handles tasks such as: 1. Staffing and training: Transdev is responsible for employing and training the personnel who drive vehicles, maintain the fleet, and provide support services for VINE Transit. 2. Maintenance and fleet management: Transdev ensures that vehicles are properly maintained and kept in good condition, following the guidelines established by the NVTA to provide safe and reliable transportation services. 3. Scheduling and dispatching: Transdev works on creating the transit schedules, coordinating the services and routes, and managing the dispatch of vehicles in order to efficiently serve the passengers and meet their transportation needs. 4. Customer service and public relations: Transdev communicates with passengers, addresses grievances and concerns, and provides information and updates related to the VINE Transit services. In conclusion, while both the Napa Valley Transportation Authority and Transdev are involved in the operations of the VINE Transit, each organization has its unique roles and responsibilities. The NVTA serves as the managing entity, overseeing the functioning and performance of the VINE Transit system, whereas Transdev is the contracted operator responsible for handling the day-to-day operations. Therefore, it would not be accurate to say that VINE Transit is operated by the Napa Valley Transportation Authority, as the direct operation is the responsibility of Transdev."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The hot air evaporates the remaining moisture on the dishes, and the steam generated is then vented out, leaving the dishes dry. In fan-assisted drying, a fan circulates the air inside the dishwasher, promoting evaporation and speeding up the drying process.

The answer to the question: Who assigned the man who would later use the Chac Mool as a motif the pointing machine assignment? is inside the article: After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., can you guess it ?","completion":"In the given article, it is mentioned that during an exercise set by Derwent Wood, the professor of sculpture at the Royal College, Henry Moore was assigned the task of using the pointing machine.

The SNA was a political and military alliance, led by General Mohamed Farrah Aidid, and consisted of various Somali factions that opposed the presence of the United Nations and US troops in the country. The Battle of Mogadishu was a significant event in Operation Restore Hope, a humanitarian mission led by the United Nations to provide assistance and establish order in the war-torn Somalia. The battle was a result of an attempt by United States Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers to capture Aidid's high-ranking lieutenants. The operation met heavy resistance from the SNA and local militias, and the battle lasted for two days, resulting in numerous casualties on both sides. In conclusion, the relationship between the Somali National Alliance and the Battle of Mogadishu exists because the SNA, as an opposing faction, played a major role in the conflict that unfolded during the battle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His job is threatened when up-and-coming story executive Larry Levy (Peter Gallagher) begins working at the studio. Mill has also been receiving death threat postcards, assumed to be from a screenwriter whose pitch he rejected. Mill surmises that the disgruntled writer is David Kahane (Vincent D'Onofrio). Mill is told by Kahane's girlfriend, June Gudmundsdottir (Greta Scacchi) that Kahane is at a theater in Pasadena. Mill pretends to recognize Kahane in the lobby, and offers him a scriptwriting deal, hoping this will stop the threats. The two go to a nearby bar where Kahane gets intoxicated and rebuffs Mill's offer; he calls Mill a liar and continues goading him about his job security at the studio. In the bar's parking lot, the two men fight. Mill goes too far and accidentally drowns Kahane in a shallow pool of water, then stages the crime to make it look like a botched robbery. The next day, after Mill is late for and distracted at a meeting, Studio chief of security Walter Stuckel (Fred Ward) confronts Mill about the murder and says that the police know Mill was the last one to see Kahane alive. At the end of their conversation Mill receives a fax from his stalker. Thus, Mill has killed the wrong man, and the stalker apparently knows this. Mill attends Kahane's funeral and gets into conversation with June. Detectives Avery (Whoopi Goldberg) and DeLongpre (Lyle Lovett) suspect Mill is guilty of murder.

David Bruce Vitter (born May 3, 1961) is an American lobbyist, lawyer and politician who served as United States Senator for Louisiana from 2005 to 2017. He was the first Republican elected to the Senate from his state since the Reconstruction Era. Previously, he served in the United States House of Representatives, representing the suburban Louisiana's 1st congressional district. He served as a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives before entering the U.S. House. Vitter has been actively involved with legislation concerning illegal immigrants. In June 2007, he led a group of conservative Senators in blocking federal Immigration Legislation that would have granted a pathway to legal residence to 12 million illegal immigrants coupled with increased border enforcement. The bill's defeat won Vitter national attention as the bill was supported by President George W. Bush, John McCain, and Ted Kennedy, among others. Vitter characterized the bill as amnesty, which supporters denied. Bush accused the bill's opponents of fear mongering. In October 2007, Vitter introduced an amendment withholding Community Oriented Policing Services funds from any sanctuary city which bans city employees and police officers from asking people about their immigration status in violation of the Illegal Immigration Act. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, in opposition to the amendment, said these cities do not want to inquire about someone's status if they report a crime, are a victim of domestic violence or get vaccinations for their children. The amendment was defeated. In November 2007, Vitter introduced a bill requiring banks to verify that no customer was an illegal immigrant before issuing banking or credit cards. The bill never made it out of committee. In March 2008, Vitter reintroduced the latter two proposals and cosponsored ten of eleven other bills in a Republican package of tough immigration enforcement measures including jail time for illegal border crossing; deportation for any immigrant (legal or illegal) for a single driving while intoxicated; declaration of English as the official language (thereby terminating language assistance at voting booths and federal agencies)' additional construction of a border fence; permission for local and state police to enforce immigration laws and penalties for states who issue drivers licenses to illegals. None of these proposals passed, partially because the Democratic-controlled Senate preferred a comprehensive approach which would include a guest-worker program and a path to citizenship for the current population more akin to the package defeated by Vitter in 2007. In April 2008, Vitter introduced a joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment that a child born in the United States is not a citizen unless a parent is a citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien serving in the military. Currently the Constitution grants citizenship to children born within the U.S. regardless of the legal status of the parents. The bill never made it out of the Democratic-led committee.

Many important people wanted this idea to become a rule, but David Vitter said it was like giving away a reward for doing something wrong. Other people disagreed with him, but he won that fight.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Evolution of the Horse. The fossil record reveals how horses evolved. Q: What can be looked at to see a record of how horses evolved? A: The answer is:","completion":"The fossil record can be looked at to see a record of how horses evolved. Fossils are the preserved remains or traces of animals, plants, and other organisms from the past, which have been embedded within layers of sedimentary rock and soil. These formations provide crucial evidence for understanding the development of life on Earth, as they offer a window into the natural history of organisms that lived millions of years ago. In the case of horse evolution, studying the fossil record provides valuable insight into the various stages horses went through as they adapted to changes in their environment and biological pressures. By analyzing the fossils, scientists can observe changes in horse anatomy, including the gradual transformation of their teeth, limbs, and overall size. This information contributes significantly to our understanding of the evolutionary process of horses. The horse's evolutionary journey is believed to have started around 55 million years ago with a small, multi-toed creature called Hyracotherium or Eohippus. Over time, as climate and ecological conditions changed, these early horses diversified and adapted to different environments, giving rise to various branches of the horse family tree. One of the most notable evolutionary changes in horses is the reduction of the number of toes. Early horses had four toes on their front feet and three on their rear feet, which provided better traction and mobility in the soft, swampy environments they initially inhabited. As grasslands replaced forests and softer ground, horses evolved to have a single hoofed toe, making them better suited to run fast on hard terrain. This characteristic can be observed in the modern horse, which possesses only one toe on each foot. Another striking feature that can be seen in the horse fossil record is the change in tooth structure. Early horses had simple, low-crowned teeth that were well-adapted for browsing on soft leaves and shrubs. However, as their diet shifted to grazing on grasses, horse teeth evolved into high-crowned molars with complex ridges, which allowed them to break down the tough, fibrous plant material more efficiently. Moreover, the fossil record also reveals a gradual increase in horse body size over time. Early horse ancestors were small, about the size of a dog, but as they adapted to various habitats and food sources, they grew larger to cover greater distances efficiently, and to compete better for resources with other species. In summary, by examining the fossil record, researchers can gain substantial knowledge about the evolution of horses. This includes observing changes in their anatomy, such as the number of toes, tooth structure, and overall size, as well as understanding how these modifications were influenced by changes in climate, diet, and ecological conditions. The fossil record serves as a rich source of information that allows us to piece together the fascinating evolutionary journey of horses and their adaptations throughout history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While walking by Minnie Mouse's house one day, Mickey Mouse is enticed by the aroma of a cake Minnie is baking. Promised a slice if he cleans the yard, Mickey immediately jumps into raking up the fall leaves littering Minnie's lawn. While working in the yard, a small tornado as tall as Mickey comes along and makes his work more complicated: first the youngster hops into the basket and leaps over Mickey countless times before he pounds the basket in place, shaking it to check if it's snared. After he throws the leaves in, the child pounces on him, spins him around, grabs his hat, and taunts him. Angered, Mickey pounces on the youngster, who spins him around and scoots away, leaving Mickey's hat on his head. Both Mickey and the youngster have a tug'o'war on the basket until it shatters on Mickey, who is entangled. Then, the child makes an army of leaves and marches around the house. Mickey manages to trap the child with a sack, which he ties and punts away. The tornadoling retaliates with just 2 punches, then attempts to get away, with Mickey hot on his heels. As Mickey chases him with a rake the terrified child calls out for help. The mother tornado, unamused with Mickey tormenting her offspring (and unaware of what her child has been doing to Mickey), furiously pursues him with a look of relentlessness on her face.

Plot title: The Gold Rush Movie plot: Big Jim and the Lone Prospector in the wobbling cabin The following is the plot of the 1942 re-release: Big Jim, a gold prospector during the Klondike Gold Rush, has just found an enormous gold deposit on his parcel of land when a blizzard strikes. The Lone Prospector gets lost in the same blizzard while also prospecting for gold. He stumbles into the cabin of Black Larsen, a wanted criminal. Larsen tries to throw him out when Jim also stumbles inside. Larsen tries to scare both out using his shotgun but is overpowered by Jim and the three agree to an uneasy truce where they all can stay in the cabin. When the storm is taking so long that food is running out, the three draw lots for who will have to go out into the blizzard to obtain some food. Larsen loses and leaves the cabin. While outside looking for food, he encounters Jim's gold deposit and decides to ambush him there when Jim returns. Meanwhile, the two remaining in the cabin get so desperate that they cook and eat one of the Prospector's shoes. Later, Jim gets delirious, imagines the Prospector as a giant chicken and attacks him. At that moment, a bear enters the cabin and is killed, supplying them with food. After the storm subsides, both leave the cabin, the Prospector continuing on to the next gold boom town while Jim returns to his gold deposit. There, he is knocked out by Larsen with a shovel. While fleeing with some of the mined gold, Larsen is swept to his death in an avalanche. Jim recovers consciousness and wanders into the snow, but he has lost his memory from the blow. When he returns to the town, his memory has been partly restored and he remembers that he had found a large gold deposit, that the deposit was close to a certain cabin and that he had stayed in the cabin with the Prospector. But he does neither know the location of the deposit nor of the cabin. So, he goes looking for the Prospector, hoping that he still knows the location of the cabin. The Prospector arrives at the town and encounters Georgia, a dance hall girl. To irritate... My question: What did Jim imagine the Prospector was?

Write highlights for this article: The UK economy has shaken off the European crisis with growth figures that outshine its G7 peers. It is expected to grow 3.1% this year, according to a forecast by the prestigious EY ITEM Club, above earlier expectations of 2.9%. The growth is well above that expected of Germany, Europe's biggest economy and one which dragged the bloc out of crisis, at 1.8%. \\"We have moved from the recovery phase to expansion. And furthermore, it's looking very durable,\\" said Peter Spencer, professor of Economics and Finance at University of York and chief economic adviser to the ITEM Club. Figures released Friday show the British economy passing the pre-crisis peak from 2008, with second quarter of growth of 0.8%. Spencer said the growth is no longer financed by people tapping into their savings -- as was the case this time last year -- but by business expansion and a stronger labor market. Business spending is on the rise, meaning companies are investing into production rather than sitting on cash. Business investment by itself now generates more than half of the UK's growth. The government is trumpeting a record-high employment -- 73.1% of people were in work in the three months to May, matching up the previous record-high from 2004/2005. But there is a catch. While record numbers of Brits are working, their wages are growing at the slowest rate on record -- and at about half of the inflation rate. That fuels another problem of the UK's economy -- the chronic and rising inequality. Of all UK households, only the highest earning 20% increased their disposable income last year. The remaining 80% of households suffered a drop in their income, numbers released by the Office of National Statistics show. The Bank of England has also warned that the UK productivity has been \\"extremely and uncharacteristically weak\\" since the recession. Productivity growth, which indicates if the economy can produce more for less, remains below the pre-crisis levels, at 16%. Many economists are also warning the UK about a potential housing bubble. The average cost of a home in the UK is now 20% above the pre-crisis peak in 2007. The IMF has already warned the UK government that rising house prices and low productivity could hinder the economic growth and urged the country to put in place \\"early measures\\" to prevent housing bubble. But Spencer told CNN the fears of a bubble were overblown. \\"This is not driven by mortgage borrowing. In London for example, it's mainly cash buying and overseas buyers,\\" he said, pointing to relatively flat mortgage borrowing. The UK is also vulnerable to shocks from outside. Half of the country's international trade is with the European Union countries, many of which are still suffering from the consequences of the eurozone crisis. \\"If Germany takes a hit, we'll suffer too. If Germany does well, we'll do well, like the rest of Europe,\\" Spencer said.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war.

Judith , after having a deal with Bardo and Ginger to help her kill the toys , they head off back to the Warehouse . Question: \\"What happens in the warehouse?\\" Answer: \\"the bum dies\\" Is this answer correct? pick from the following. a. no b. yes...I think the answer is","completion":"a. no The provided answer, \\"the bum dies,\\" is not a complete and accurate representation of the events that transpire in the warehouse. It only mentions one incident, which is important but not the crux of the story. In the warehouse, several events unfold. Firstly, Judith Grey, who has been keeping a watch on the Toyland Warehouse, enters the building but is eventually arrested for trespassing. This suggests that she is suspicious of the toys' activities and is determined to uncover the truth behind them. Secondly, a bum breaks into the warehouse and accidentally revives the demonic toys, including Baby Oopsie Daisy, Jack Attack, Mr. Static, and Zombietoid. These killer toys eventually force the new security guard, Ray Vernon, to assist them in fulfilling their needs. In addition to this, the main characters, Brick Bardo and Nurse Ginger, team up with Judith to locate and eliminate the toys. They venture back to the warehouse to accomplish this mission. Thus, although the death of the bum is indeed an event that occurs in the warehouse, it is only one of the many significant happenings contributing to the overall narrative. A more suitable answer would be something like: \\"In the warehouse, a bum inadvertently revives the demonic toys, Judith Grey is arrested after sneaking in, and the toys manipulate the security guard Ray Vernon to do their bidding. Eventually, Brick Bardo, Nurse Ginger, and Judith return to the warehouse to confront and destroy the toys.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. Paragraph: In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In battle day two would group A have less openings or more openings in their nest thatch? The answer to this question is:","completion":"In battle day two, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch. This is because, as mentioned in the background information, Acromyrmex heyeri workers create more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up in order to regulate the temperature for the colony. On battle day two, group A territory had a temperature of 22 °C, which falls within the range of 20–30 °C where the workers are known to create more openings for temperature regulation. Therefore, it can be concluded that on battle day two, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch as a method of maintaining an optimal environment for the colony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant.

After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave.

The thieves need a way to smuggle the two tons of gold bars into Europe. There are only four master criminals considered able to smuggle the gold: a Frenchman, so crippled he can barely move his wheelchair; an Irishman, so nearsighted that he is arrested after trying to hold up a police station instead of a bank; a German, so fat he can barely get through a door â and Aldo Vanucci (Peter Sellers), also known as The Fox, a master criminal with a talent for disguise. Vanucci is in prison. He knows about the smuggling contract, but is reluctant to accept it, because he does not want to disgrace his mother and young sister, Gina (Britt Ekland). However, when his three sidekicks inform him that Gina has grown up and does not always come home after school, an enraged, over-protective Vanucci vows to escape. He succeeds by impersonating the prison doctor and convincing the guards that Vanucci has tied him up and escaped. The guards capture the real doctor and bring him face to face with Vanucci, who flees with the aid of his gang. Vanucci returns home where his mother tells him that Gina is working on the Via Veneto.

Article: It was September of 2003 and I was struggling to find work after experiencing downsizing . I had fallen on some of the grandest challenges of my life. I found myself sitting in my house constantly worried. I decided to force myself to find some volunteer work to occupy my thoughts. The first place I sought out was the Arizona Humane Society. It offered me a program, \\"Equestrian Therapy Program\\" ,whose mission is to build self-esteem and confidence in children who have been through difficult times in their lives. Being with animals was the only time I truly felt 1 had a place in the world. But I had never been around a horse in my life. I found myself a little apprehensive during my first day--being around such large strong animals was much harder than the three cats I'm accustomed to caring for. I found that I wasn't different during my first day around these fantastic creatures from the kids who came into the program. But there is a strange transformation when one is around horses. I found myself playing the role of student, observer, teacher, mentor, worker, friend, and companion; not only to the kids,but to the horses and staff! Before long, I was good at handling the horses and kids and having a grand time working with human and animal elements equally. I realize this experience has helped me to develop my horizons in ways I never thought likely. I started this wanting to give others help and realized in doing so I was the one who really benefited the most. 1 believe the companionship and peace that comes from working with our animal brothers is something that can and will make the world a better place!

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman. The school in Hancock has continued since Monteux's death. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Monteux"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In the 1500s, South American fishermen said that the sea became warmer every few years. They gave this special event a Spanish name 'El Nino', meaning 'the baby'. It is called 'the baby' because it arrives around Christmas. El Nino is a huge area of warm water in the middle of cold water in the Pacific Ocean. It happens every two to seven years. It moves around the ocean and becomes bigger and smaller at different times. This warm water affects the weather. It is always raining over El Nino. El Nino contains a lot of energy. Scientists think this energy is formed when wind comes from the northern half of the world. The winds blow across warm sea water in the south. When the strong wind hits the warm water, violent weather happens. Scientists think that El Nino existed for many thousands of years. El Nino affects every person in the world because it affects the entire world's weather. It can bring the rain that farmers need. It can bring storms that destroy homes. It can mean that fishermen cannot catch fish, and it can bring floods. There is nothing we can do about El Nino. It is an event of nature. We can help the world's weather by trying to stop the greenhouse effect and air pollution. The most important job for scientists is to learn how to predict when El Nino is going to bring dangerous weather. Then, people can try to prepare for storms, floods and droughts.

It is here that the process of mechanical digestion begins as the food is chewed by the teeth. The chewing action not only breaks down the food into smaller particles but also increases the surface area, making it easier for the enzymes in saliva to act upon. As the food is being chewed, the salivary glands in the mouth release saliva, a digestive fluid containing enzymes like salivary amylase. This enzyme initiates the breakdown of carbohydrates present in the food. While chewing, the tongue helps to mix the food with saliva, allowing the enzymes to properly coat the food particles and making it easier for the food to be swallowed as a cohesive and moist bolus.

Both sentences convey the same core idea, which is that a girl spent her first six years in Angeles City before relocating to Manila, but they are expressed with slightly different wording and structure. Paraphrasing is a technique used to restate information, thoughts, or ideas in different words while maintaining the original meaning. Here, we can break down and compare the two sentences to further illustrate their similarity in meaning: 1. \\"The first six years of her childhood spent in Angeles City before she moved to Manila.\\" 2. \\"She spent the first six years of her childhood in Angeles City before moving to Manila.\\" In sentence 1, the subject \\"her\\" is implied in the phrase \\"The first six years of her childhood,\\" while the verb \\"spent\\" is acting as a past participle in a passive voice construction. The time period comes first, followed by the locations: \\"Angeles City\\" and \\"Manila.\\" The sequence of events is clarified with the conjunction \\"before,\\" which shows that moving to Manila happened after her initial years spent in Angeles City. In sentence 2, the sentence structure is more straightforward and active. The subject \\"She\\" is clearly mentioned at the beginning, followed by the verb \\"spent.\\" The time period and locations are conveyed in a similar manner as in sentence 1, with \\"the first six years of her childhood\\" indicating the duration, and \\"Angeles City\\" and \\"Manila\\" showing where she lived during these periods. The use of \\"before\\" as a conjunction is also present in this sentence, serving the same purpose as in the first sentence. Despite the differences in structure, both paraphrased sentences effectively express the same core idea and can be used interchangeably to convey this information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Burma had many tropical forests, while a sister country from a temperate climate, Belarus, had beautiful ancient temperate forests. Both countries were significant lumber exporters. Which country had a longer growing season? A:","completion":"The length of the growing season in a country is determined by its climate. In the case of Burma (now Myanmar) and Belarus, the geographical location and distinctive climatic conditions of each significantly influence their growing seasons. Burma, located in Southeast Asia, enjoys a tropical monsoon climate. It has three specific seasons: the hot season (March to April), the rainy season (May to October), and the cool season (November to February). However, given it's a tropical climate, the region experiences relatively high temperatures throughout the year, leading to a long growing season. Even the distinction between seasons in a tropical zone like Burma is more related to rainfall than temperature. And thanks to the tropical climate's ample sunlight and warmth, plants can grow year-round, making Burma's effective growing season quite extensive. Contrarily, Belarus, located in Eastern Europe, has a temperate continental climate with relatively mild summers and long, cold winters, which limit its growing season. The Belarusian growing season typically starts in late April or early May and ends by mid-October. Once winter sets in, the drop in temperature, the frost, and the snow leave the ground too cold for plant growth. So, while anytime from May through October can be considered as having suitable conditions for growth, the growing season is limited by these harsh winters. Comparing both countries, even though they are both significant lumber exporters, Burma's tropical climate provides it with a longer growing season relative to Belarus's temperate continental climate. This extended growing season in Burma allows it to sustain tropical rainforests rich with a diverse range of flora, including many hardwood tree species suitable for lumber. On the other hand, Belarus' temperate forests have seasonal variations that lead to a shorter growing season, but they support a different set of tree species also used for lumber production. It's also important to note that while a longer growing season can enhance lumber output, it doesn't necessarily denote the value or quality of the produced lumber. The specific type of trees and the lumber properties they have, which can vary greatly between tropical and temperate forests, significantly affect their uses and demand in global markets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter. - Melanie Clare Sophie \\"Mel\\" Giedroyc (born 5 June 1968) is an English presenter, actress and comedian, best known for her comedy work with Sue Perkins, co-hosting series including \\"Light Lunch\\" for Channel 4, \\"The Great British Bake Off\\" for the BBC and chat show \\"Mel and Sue\\" for ITV. - BBC One is the flagship television channel of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the United Kingdom, Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It was launched on 2 November 1936 as the BBC Television Service, and was the world's first regular television service with a high level of image resolution. It was renamed BBC TV in 1960, using this name until the launch of sister channel BBC2 in 1964, whereupon the BBC TV channel became known as BBC1, with the current spelling adopted in 1997. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402. - Light Lunch was a Channel 4 lunch-time comedy chatshow broadcast on weekdays at 12:30 between March 1997 and February 1998.

Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection. - Channel 4 is a British public-service television broadcaster that began transmission on 2 November 1982. Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time. - The Channel Islands (Norman: \\"Îles d'la Manche\\", French: \\"Îles Anglo-Normandes\\" or \\"Îles de la Manche\\") are an archipelago in the English Channel, off the French coast of Normandy.

The Crown dependencies are not members of the Commonwealth of Nations nor of the European Union. They have a total population of about 168,000, and the bailiwicks' respective capitals, Saint Helier and Saint Peter Port, have populations of 33,500 and 16,488, respectively. The total area of the islands is 198 km. - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden. - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland. The head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, who holds the title of Lord of Mann. The Lord of Mann is represented by a Lieutenant Governor. Foreign relations and defence are the responsibility of the British Government. - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society. - A double act, also known as a comedy duo, is a comic pairing in which humor is derived from the uneven relationship between two partners, usually of the same gender, age, ethnic origin and profession but drastically different in terms of personality or behavior. Often one of the members of the duothe straight man, feed, dead wood, or stoogeis portrayed as reasonable and serious, while the other onethe funny man, banana man or comicis portrayed as funny, less educated or less intelligent, silly, or unorthodox. If the audience identifies primarily with one character, the other will often be referred to as a comic foil.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: In 1981, Dr Mohga Kamal-Yanni was preparing to leave Egypt for a clinical attachment in England when her father had a heart attack. He fell in the street, and was taken to a public hospital, where Dr Kamal-Yanni kept vigil at his bedside until he regained his strength. A doctor at a hospital in India where health indicators have showed no significant improvement in seven years. During his stay in the hospital, she was appalled at the low level of healthcare available to him. \\"It was awful. There was no medicine,\\" she told CNN. As a doctor, Kamal-Yanni was able to watch over her father's progress. Her professional opinion on his recovery was striking. \\"My father survived that heart attack for two reasons,\\" she said. \\"One, because of God's will, and two, because he had a strong will. It was nothing to do with the health service.\\" The following year, Kamal-Yanni came to England to do a clinical attachment. She found herself deeply affected by the stark contrast between the healthcare available in Britain, on the publicly funded National Health Service, and the healthcare available at home in Egypt. She found herself slipping into depression. \\"I couldn't talk to the patients; I couldn't talk to the doctors. I just couldn't cope with it,\\" she revealed to CNN. \\"I couldn't understand why every time I saw a monitor next to a patient I was so upset.\\" It dawned on her that the gulf in care was troubling her. \\"I kept thinking why on earth my dad didn't have that. The only reason was that he happened to be born in Egypt and these people had the luck to be born [in England].\\" Kamal-Yanni is now a senior health & HIV policy advisor at third-world charity Oxfam. Her first-hand experience of the divide between the healthcare available in richer countries, and that on offer in poorer ones, has given her the impetus to try and narrow the gap. While Western countries are pushing the boundaries of scientific knowledge, discovering the potential of nanotechnology and other high-tech solutions to the developed world's diseases, like diabetes, cancer and obesity, poor countries are struggling to combat health problems such as HIV, malaria and TB. Lack of infrastructure. And it's not as simple as shipping medicines and supplies in bulk quantities. Oxfam's \\"Paying for People\\" report, published in February this year, said that poor countries are suffering because they lack the infrastructure of a health service. The WHO's 2006 \\"World Health Report\\" also indicates that 4.25 million doctors, nurses and health workers are needed across 57 countries. Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, has 600,000 health workers: one million more are required. Without these key workers, it is questionable whether healthcare in poor countries can be improved. Nicky Wimble, a spokesperson for Oxfam, told CNN, \\"There is money coming in for drugs now, but there's no commitment to long-term aid.\\" Governments are unable to give healthcare workers with job security and doctors and nurses, where they do exist, are largely poorly paid: so people choose other careers. \\"They're either becoming taxi drivers, or working for private businesses,\\" Wimble says. This double brain-drain (one internal, one external as those who do train are tempted away by higher salaries and brighter futures in developed countries) means that even if drugs make it to poorer areas, there can be no one to administer them. \\"Drugs are sitting in cupboards,\\" Wimble told CNN. \\"Or they're available in cities but people in rural areas don't have the bus fares to get to them.\\" Vulnerable to disease. Dr Kamal-Yanni backs this up. She told CNN, \\"There is no public investment in health systems so people have to pay for it. If you're poor you can't buy your healthcare and if you're a woman who happens to be poor you might as well forget it.\\" And in countries where no healthcare system exists, people are extremely vulnerable to diseases, which can spread rampantly and unchecked through communities. Dr Kamal-Yanni paints a worrying picture. \\"Particularly in Africa, they're not equipped to face anything -- not HIV, let alone avian flu. If something like avian flu hit Africa with no health system, no health workers and no money, it would spread. We can't contain it in Africa. The world would wake up and realize that, but in the meantime, it would have wiped out goodness knows how many millions of people.\\" It's not just in Africa. HIV is a known crisis there, but it is anticipated that more people will be infected in India than anywhere else, as the disease spreads quickly through its billion-strong population. Increasingly, countries like these are having to deal with a boom in incommunicable diseases, like diabetes and cancer. Chronic diseases like diabetes have the additional problem that they require long-term care, and therefore long-term funding. Dr Kamal-Yanni explained the difficulties of that situation. \\"You buy the pills today, but maybe tomorrow you don't have enough money so you're never cured and develop complications.\\" What lies ahead? Dr Kamal-Yanni sees three possible outcomes for health in poor countries. The first, as she explained, is bleak. She told CNN, \\"If things continue as they are, with rising infection, increasing resistance to drugs, HIV and malaria run unchecked, chronic and non-communicable diseases are ignored and no money is spent on a health system, then the gap will just increase and the situation will get worse and worse.\\" Dr Kamal-Yanni is hopeful, however, that the situation will improve somewhat. She explained a second scenario, the one she feels is most likely to happen. \\"If the international community invests a little bit, things will be slightly better,\\" she told CNN. \\"More people with HIV will get treatment, as will people with TB and malaria. But non-communicable chronic diseases [like diabetes] will be ignored.\\" But large-scale epidemics like avian flu or SARS would still remain a huge threat in this scenario, as would diseases like cancer. \\"Who's going to pay for medicine for cancer, which is increasing like anything in developing countries?\\" asks Dr Kamal-Yanni. \\"Nobody.\\" Hope for the future. But there is a third scenario, which holds out more hope for people in developing countries. Dr Kamal-Yanni says, \\"If public pressure is high, southern governments, donors and the international community will decide that health is really a priority. We'll put our money where our mouth is and we'll fulfil the commitments that we've made before.\\" She says that in the first instance, African countries need to be encouraged to divert 16 percent of their budget to health. (Currently, nearly a third allocate less than five percent.) \\"Then they will realize that this is not enough, so they'll put in more,\\" she continues. If this money were to be added to the 50 billion promised by G8, the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations, in Gleneagles in 2005, it would have a huge impact on health and education, particularly in Africa. And education is the key, Dr Kamal-Yanni believes. She explained, \\"You can't separate health and education because unless you educate doctors and nurses, and midwives and pharmacists, you can't run a health service.\\" Working together. It's also important for donors and governments to work together to provide a cohesive service, she says. \\"They really need to start coordinating their work so it's not a series of vertical programs that don't relate to each other and waste resources.\\" Oxfam's Nicky Wimble agrees. She told CNN, \\"Over the last 100 years, countries like France, Britain and America have developed by giving their people free education and healthcare. It's a major way to bring people out of poverty.\\" Wimble cites the example of education, where the number of children not in school worldwide has fallen from around 120 million to around 80 million. \\"The key is getting governments to commit to it as a part of their aid package, and monitoring the aid package so that the money is tracked to ensure that it gets to where it's intended,\\" she said. \\"It's working for education, and they think it'll work for healthcare too, but it needs committed investment.\\" And in the meantime, people like Mohga Kamal-Yanni will continue their work to pressure governments to encourage positive change. She says, \\"That's my motivation to do this work. It's not for me; it's a life thing. My dream in life is for everybody in Africa to have access to a publicly financed, publicly run healthcare service with strong regulation, quality, care and equity.\\" E-mail to a friend.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what absorbs sunlight? \\" is \\"earth orbiting the Sun\\", given that solar panels absorb sunlight. ?","completion":"In order to determine the right answer to the question \\"what absorbs sunlight?\\" I'll analyze the two options provided: Option 1: Earth orbiting the Sun Option 2: Solar panels Step 1: Understanding the context of the options Both options are related to the absorption of sunlight. Earth receives and absorbs sunlight due to its orbit around the Sun, which allows sunlight to reach its surface, be absorbed by various materials, and subsequently support life. Solar panels, on the other hand, are specifically designed to absorb sunlight and convert it into usable electricity. Step 2: Comparing the scope of the options Between the two options, solar panels have a narrower scope as they specifically focus on the absorption and conversion of sunlight for a specific purpose (electricity generation). Earth orbiting the Sun has a broader scope as it involves a variety of absorption-types and processes (heat, energy for photosynthesis, etc.), not solely electricity generation. Step 3: Choosing the most appropriate answer Given that solar panels absorb sunlight and have a more specific purpose, the better answer to the question \\"what absorbs sunlight?\\" would be \\"solar panels.\\" This is because the context of the question is likely about the absorption and conversion of sunlight for a practical application and not specifically about the general concept of Earth being illuminated by the Sun. However, it's important to note that there are other possible answers too, such as plants (they absorb sunlight for photosynthesis) and various surfaces on Earth that absorb sunlight for heating purposes. The context of the question should guide the choice of the most appropriate answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

However, we can consider each option and make a logical choice based on the provided information. Option 1: The man ends with a walk along a rocky beach and carrying his skateboard on his right shoulder. This option seems plausible since the man is already on the move, skating through different areas. Ending his journey at a beach is probable, and carrying his skateboard could indicate the end of his skating session. Option 2: The man finally parallels the walkway showing music while also passing houses. This can be seen as a possibility considering he is already passing houses, but the statement \\"showing music\\" feels out of context, as there was no earlier reference to any music-related activity. Option 3: The man walks and gains leg room. This statement is a bit ambiguous as it's unclear what it means for the man to \\"gain leg room\\". If it's referring to him getting off his skateboard and walking, it could potentially be a logical sequence, but the \\"leg room\\" part doesn't quite align with the given context. Option 4: The man turns quickly to continue doing his walkthroughs with his dogs, then transitions back into the same man dancing. This option introduces two new elements - dogs and dancing. Given that there was no previous mention of him having dogs or dancing, this ending seems less probable compared to others. In conclusion, on evaluating all the options, Option 1: \\"The man ends with a walk along a rocky beach and carrying his skateboard on his right shoulder\\" appears to be the most plausible and coherent ending based on the initial narrative. It appears to be a smooth transition and logical continuation of his journey with the skateboard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who became well-known for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones? ? William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

Sentence1: Rosie's teacher's birthday was coming up in 5 days. Sentence2: Rosie did not have money to buy a present. Sentence3: She asked her grandmother to teach her how to draw sunflowers. Sentence4: Rosie's teacher loved the gift. After reading the sentences, I noticed that there's a gap between Sentence3 and Sentence4. We know that Rosie learned how to draw sunflowers but we don't know if she actually drew one and gave it as a gift to her teacher. Therefore, the position of the missing sentence is 4. Now, I will create a sentence that fits in the position I have identified and complete the story.

Article: It often happens that a number of applicants with almost the same qualifications and experience all apply for the same position. In their educational background, special skills and work experience, there is little, if anything, to choose between half a dozen candidates. How then does the employer make a choice? Usually on the basis of an interview. There are many arguments for and against the interview as a way of selection. The main argument against it is that it results in a wholly _ decision. As often as not, employers do not choose the best candidate. They choose the candidate who makes a good first impression on them. Some employers, of course, reply to this argument by saying that they have become so experienced in interviewing staff that they are able to make a good assessment of each candidate's likely performance. The main argument in favor of the interview is that an employer is concerned not only with a candidate's ability, but with his or her suitable personality for the particular work situation. Many employers, for example, will overlook occasional mistakes from their secretary if she has a pleasant personality. It is perhaps true to say, therefore, that the real purpose of an interview is not to assess the assessable aspects of each candidate but to make a guess at the things that are hard to measure, such as personality, character and social ability. Unfortunately, both for the employers and applicants for jobs, there are many people of great ability who simply do not interview well. There are also, of course, people who interview extremely well, but are later found to be very unsatisfactory employees. Candidates who interview well tend to be quietly confident, but never boastful , direct and straightforward in their questions and answers; cheerful and friendly, but never over-familiar; and sincerely enthusiastic and optimistic. Candidates who interview badly tend to be either very shy or over-confident. They either talk too little or never stop talking. They are either over polite or a bit rude.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Many anti-dandruff shampoos only have one formula, but others are formulated for different hair types. Focus on finding a shampoo that helps cut down dandruff first; if that shampoo makes your overall hair quality worsen (e.g., making your hair limp, dry, or weak), consider looking for a special formula that contains the same active ingredient while correcting the new problem. While some dandruff shampoos are also available in multiple scents, the smell of your shampoo should be the last concern on your list. Dandruff control and overall hair health maintenance should be of greater concern. While the conditioner itself won't help fight the dandruff, it's important to select a conditioner that won't strip away the active ingredient in the shampoo. Your best bet is to select a conditioner specifically formulated to accompany your shampoo of choice. If you are unable to find a conditioner that matches your shampoo, try to find one made with natural or organic ingredients. Gentle moisturizers are usually best, but stay away from clarifying conditioners. If you eventually decide to introduce a normal shampoo back into your hair care routine, stay away from those containing ingredients ammonium lauryl sulfate and other anionic surfactants, which tend to dry the scalp and worsen the problem. Try to find a sulfate-free shampoo instead. Also note that washing your hair too frequently or not often enough can worsen dandruff. Once your dandruff problem is under control, you should only wash your hair once every other day at most, and at least two or three times per week at minimum. If you are unable to get your dandruff under control on your own, consult your family doctor or dermatologist and ask for a prescription-strength shampoo or steroid lotion. While dandruff is frequently caused by dry skin, it could also be caused by a medical condition, like seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, or fungal infections. Your doctor will be able to determine the cause of your dandruff and work with you to find the best solution for it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article talks about finding the right shampoo and conditioner for dealing with dandruff.

What is the answer: How many full terms in office did US President F D Roosevelt serve?","completion":"Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, served four terms in office. Elected in November 1932, he assumed the presidency during the Great Depression and held the office until his death in April 1945. However, it's important to note that he only served three full terms and part of a fourth term. Roosevelt's tenure in the White House can be divided as follows: 1. First Term (1933-1937): Upon taking office, FDR prioritized economic recovery by enacting various policies and programs as part of his New Deal. Aimed at providing relief for the unemployed, fostering recovery for businesses and the economy, and reforming the financial system to prevent future crises, his first term focused on addressing the immediate challenges caused by the Great Depression. 2. Second Term (1937-1941): Building on the foundations of the New Deal, FDR continued implementing social programs and policies in his second term to protect the American people from the harsh economic conditions. Although economic recovery faced setbacks during this period, leading to a recession in 1937-1938, the prevailing global tensions foreshadowed the onset of World War II. Roosevelt responded by pushing for increased military spending and preparedness. 3. Third Term (1941-1945): With Europe engulfed in World War II, and the U.S. responding to the attack on Pearl Harbor, FDR's third term focused on the nation's war efforts. He seamlessly transformed the U.S. economy into a war machine, building alliances and fostering cooperation among the Allied Powers. The strategic decisions made during this period ultimately paved the way for the Allies' victory. 4. Fourth Term (1945): FDR was elected to his historic fourth term in November 1944, with the end of World War II in sight. He attended the Yalta Conference in February 1945, which sought to shape the post-war world order. However, his rapidly declining health led to his untimely death on April 12, 1945, leaving Vice President Harry S. Truman to assume the presidency. Consequently, Roosevelt only served approximately three months of his fourth term. In summary, Franklin Delano Roosevelt served three full terms and the beginning of a fourth term in office as the U.S. President before his death in 1945. It's important to highlight that the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, now imposes a two-term limit on U.S. Presidents, preventing any future president from serving more than two terms in office. Roosevelt remains the only president to have served more than two terms."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In particular, the ability to adjust CPU frequency and monitor system performance is quite useful for power users. I also appreciate the constant updates made by the developers to ensure the app remains compatible with the latest Android versions. However, there are several areas where the app falls short. Firstly, it requires a certain level of technical understanding to fully exploit, which might not be suitable for the average user. A more intuitive and beginner-friendly interface would definitely make this app more appealing to a wider set of users. Additionally, I have experienced sporadic crashes, which interrupted the user experience and caused some frustration.

Please answer the following question: This article: Martin Luther King Jr. was held in the Birmingham jail and was denied a consultation with an attorney from the NAACP without guards present. When historian Jonathan Bass wrote of the incident in 2001, he noted that news of King's incarceration was spread quickly by Wyatt Tee Walker, as planned. King's supporters sent telegrams about his arrest to the White House. He could have been released on bail at any time, and jail administrators wished him to be released as soon as possible to avoid the media attention while King was in custody. However, campaign organizers offered no bail in order \\"to focus the attention of the media and national public opinion on the Birmingham situation\\".Twenty-four hours after his arrest, King was allowed to see local attorneys from the SCLC. When Coretta Scott King did not hear from her husband, she called Walker and he suggested that she call President Kennedy directly. Mrs. King was recuperating at home after the birth of their fourth child when she received a call from President Kennedy the Monday after the arrest. The president told her she could expect a call from her husband soon. When Martin Luther King Jr. called his wife, their conversation was brief and guarded; he correctly assumed that his phones were tapped. Several days later, Jacqueline Kennedy called Coretta Scott King to express her concern for King while he was incarcerated.Using scraps of paper given to him by a janitor, notes written on the margins of a newspaper, and later a legal pad given to him by SCLC attorneys, King wrote his essay \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\". It responded to eight politically moderate white clergymen who accused King of agitating local residents and not giving the incoming mayor a chance to make any changes. Bass suggested that \\"Letter from Birmingham Jail\\" was pre-planned, as was every move King and his associates made in Birmingham. The essay was a culmination of many of King's ideas, which he had touched on in earlier writings. King's arrest attracted national attention, including... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who noted that news of someone's incarceration was spread quickly by another, as planned?, what is it ?

Question: Which train of thought allows for beliefs and ideas outside of what one can physically experience? Context: Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience. This view is commonly contrasted with rationalism, which states that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses. For example, John Locke held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone. Similarly Robert Boyle, a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we have innate ideas.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that staying with the group was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners? from the following article ? In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people. Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce wore \\"In Training\\" T-shirts, and debuted the song \\"Do the Propeller!\\" during these concerts.

Review: playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as having a negative undertone. The reviewer is discussing the characters in the movie, and they mention two specific points that contribute to the negative implication: 1. The reference to \\"literary conceits\\" suggests that the characters are not fully developed or relatable, but rather feel more like abstract ideas or intellectual constructs. This can lead to the audience feeling detached from the story and having a hard time empathizing with the characters, ultimately resulting in a less satisfying movie-watching experience. 2. When the reviewer says that the characters feel like \\"literary conceits\\" rather than \\"flesh-and-blood humans,\\" they are implying that the characters lack depth, complexity, and authenticity. This statement suggests that the moviegoers may struggle to connect with the characters on a personal level, as they seem more like narrative devices employed by the filmmakers to convey a specific concept, instead of being portrayed as genuine, believable individuals. Overall, the movie review sentence points towards a criticism of the film's character development. The reviewer seems to be suggesting that the movie's portrayal of its characters is a weakness, as it does not effectively engage audience members by creating believable, multi-dimensional characters. This could negatively impact the overall reception of the film, given that character development is a crucial aspect of any storytelling medium, and an essential element in establishing an emotional connection between the audience and the narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Merman was born in her maternal grandmother's house located at 359 4th Avenue in Astoria, Queens in New York City in 1908, though she would later emphatically insist that it was actually 1912. Her father, Edward Zimmermann (1879-1977), was an accountant with James H. Dunham & Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes (Gardner) Zimmermann (1883-1974), was a teacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the Dutch Reformed Church and his wife was Presbyterian. Context: Merman began to become forgetful with advancing age, and on occasion, had difficulty with her speech. At times her behavior was erratic, causing concern among her friends. On April 7, 1983, she was preparing to travel to Los Angeles to appear on the 55th Academy Awards telecast, when she collapsed in her apartment. Merman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke. However, after undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, Merman was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma. The New York Times reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors had given Merman eight and half months to live). The tumor caused Merman to become aphasic, and, as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled. According to Merman biographer Brian Kellow, Merman's family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public. Merman's son Robert, Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother's true condition because Merman strove to keep her personal life private. He stated, \\"Mom truly appreciated [her fans'] presence and their applause. But you shouldn't attempt to be personal--she drew lines, and she could cut you off.\\" Merman's health eventually stabilized enough for her to be brought back to her apartment in Manhattan. On February 15, 1984, 10 months after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Merman died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 76. On the evening of Merman's death, all 36 theatres on Broadway dimmed their lights at 9 pm in her honor. A private funeral service for Merman was held in a chapel at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on February 27, after which Merman was cremated at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. In accordance with her wishes, Merman's remains were given to her son Robert, Jr. Merman was interred in the Shrine of Remembrance Mausoleum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, next to her daughter Ethel. On October 10, 1984, an auction of her personal effects, including furniture, artwork, and theatre memorabilia, earned in excess of 120,000 at Christie's East. The 56th Academy Awards, held on April 2, 1984, ended with a performance of \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" in tribute to Merman.

The summer of 1975 I'd just graduated from college in Southern California and received a 1968 Ford Capri for a graduation present. I had my first job, in Los Angeles. One Sunday night, thinking myself a very independent gown-up, I left my uncle's place in South Laguna after a visit, without admitting to him that I had less than an eighth of a tank of gas and no cash to buy more on the way to L.A. I pulled onto the Pacific Coast Highway and watched the needle move down as I headed north. When the engine started giving off strong smells, I pulled into a gas station. There was no self-serve then; there were no credit cards, no ATMs. I begged the guy at the station. I could write him a check for gas, I said, or I could sleep in my car and try to walk to a town with a bank the next morning. As he was informing me that I could sleep in my car but he'd have me arrested, a station wagon pulled up to the next pump. The driver--a thin, plain, middle-aged guy--overheard the tail end of my failed request. As the attendant went to serve him, he nodded at me. \\"Fill her tank first,\\" he said. \\"Really?\\" I said. Hope bloomed. \\"Oh, thank you. Thank you. But please. I just need two bucks' worth. I just need to get home.\\" \\"Fill it,\\" he repeated to the attendant.

A) in cash B) by check C) by credit D) nothing Answer:","completion":"The author had hoped that the gas station attendant would allow him to pay by check (B). In the story, the author had run out of gas and didn’t have any cash on him. He was trying to negotiate with the gas station attendant, seeking his understanding to allow him to write a check for the gas he needed to continue his journey. At the time, there were no credit cards, no ATMs, and the concept of self-serve at gas stations wasn't in use. The author finds himself in a challenging situation. He proposes to the attendant that he could write a check for the gas or sleep in his car and walk to a town with a bank the next morning, implying that he will withdraw money from the bank to pay back the gas station attendant. However, the attendant refuses him, citing that he would have him arrested before allowing him to pay with a check or promise to pay him later. The situation is resolved when a middle-aged man, overhearing the author's plight, steps in and instructs the attendant to fill the author’s car tank. He does this with the hope that the author, one day when he’s able, would do the same for someone else in need.

Fiona Salmon, 40, is guilty of cruelty towards seven residents of a care home in St Ives, Cornwall. A care home bully who tormented vulnerable care home residents was found guilty of seven charges of cruelty today. Fiona Salmon sat on one woman's legs to stop her getting out of bed, and washed another woman's face with a flannel so hard she made her nose bleed. This afternoon a jury took just two-and-a-half hours to find her guilty on all seven charges of ill-treating or neglecting residents suffering from insufficient mental capacity. Salmon, 40, committed the offences at Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home in St. Ives, Cornwall between June 2011 and January 2012. Phillip Lee, prosecuting, told Truro Crown Court that Salmon's crimes ranged from pinching and slapping to rough handling. He said Salmon also called residents names such as 'dirty b****' and told them their breath stank of dog mess. Salmon, from Camborne, Cornwall, listened in the dock as former colleague Joanna Clarke gave evidence against her. Miss Clarke told the court: 'One morning Fiona washed a resident's face with a flannel so hard that it caused a nosebleed. 'I also saw her squeezing talcum powder into a woman's face and she called her a grubby b****. 'While helping another patient she flung her on her bed so hard she hit her head on a metal railing, making her cry. 'She also pinched a patient's upper arm and sprayed deodorant in her face.' Miss Clarke added: 'Her behaviour was humiliating and there was no compassion. 'She spoke to them disrespectfully, as if they were not worth anything and as if they were an inconvenience.' Truro Crown Court heard that Fiona Salmon pinched a patient's upper arm and gave another a nosebleed. Fiona Salmon is no longer working at Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home in St Ives, Cornwall. Miss Clarke admitted to the court that she didn't tell anyone of the abuse because she feared no-one would believe her, before eventually telling a friend's mother who told the police. Another colleague, Stephanie Fielding, spoke from behind a screen to describe the horrors that Salmon put the elderly residents through over the seven-month period. She revealed how Salmon once dug her nails into a patient's skin, drawing blood. She added: 'One night we were putting a patient on her bed but she did not want to stay. Fiona decided to sit on her legs to force her. 'She cried out and shouted at Fiona to get off as she was hurting her but she just laughed and carried on for a couple of minutes until I told her to get off. A colleague told the court that Salmon's behaviour was 'humiliating, and there was no compassion' 'Fiona also swore and told a patient her breath smelt like dog mess. The patient said she was sorry.' She also said that when she was washing two male patients, Salmon made a lewd suggestion to her. Salmon listened as another colleague described her as 'cruel'. Jo Martin, defending, argued Miss Clarke was jealous of Salmon because she had been offered day shifts. She also said Miss Fielding instigated the accusations because she fell out with Salmon over a personal matter. Salmon will be sentenced at Truro Crown Court on May 10. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","completion":"Fiona Salmon, a 40-year-old care home worker, was found guilty of cruelty towards seven vulnerable residents at Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home in St Ives, Cornwall. The offences occurred between June 2011 and January 2012, and included a range of abusive actions such as pinching, slapping, and rough handling of the elderly residents. Salmon was also reported to have verbally insulted residents, calling them degrading names and commenting on their hygiene. Joanna Clarke, a former colleague who testified against Salmon in court, recounted incidents where she witnessed Salmon washing a resident's face so hard that the resident's nose bled, as well as other situations where Salmon's rough actions caused residents physical harm. Clarke described Salmon's behavior as humiliating and lacking in compassion, treating the residents as if they were inconveniences. Several other colleagues, including Stephanie Fielding, also provided testimony outlining Salmon's cruel actions towards the residents. While Clarke admitted to initially not reporting the abuse out of fear of not being believed, she eventually confided in a friend's mother, who informed the police. The jury took only two and a half hours to find Salmon guilty on all seven charges of ill-treating or neglecting residents suffering from insufficient mental capacity. She is no longer working at the Cornwallis Care Services' nursing home and is awaiting sentencing, which is scheduled for May 10 at Truro Crown Court."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The focus on the animals' weights sheds light on their growth and how it will eventually impact their relationships with Hugo, the bulldog, who at some point may not be able to physically discipline them during play fights due to their size.

Jones Beach firemen noti­fied the Wantagh Fire De­partment, which had the 80 men and eight pieces of equipment on the scene within 10 minutes. The restaurant was on the east side of the center mall, opposite parking fields 4 and 5.

Context: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame.

An ambulance from Smith's Grove, IL makes its way along the road in a thunderstorm toward the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium, where Michael, who has been in a coma since then, has been incarcerated. After the apprehensive transfer crew is seen off by medical chief of staff Dr. Hoffman, the ambulance makes its way up the driveway in the storm and back out onto the highway toward Smith's Grove.

He immediately grabs and repeatedly bashes a hospital attendant's head against the wall of the ambulance and stabs his finger right into his skull. The other attendant, trapped by the ambulance's locked doors, can only watch helplessly. Soon after, the film introduces Jamie, who has been adopted by the Carruthers family and is still mourning the loss of her mother. Laurie supposedly died in a car accident eleven months earlier. Her older foster sister Rachel comes into her room and consoles her, telling her that she will love her just as much as her mother did. Rachel sends Jamie off to bed and exits the room. Jamie kneels down next to the bed and says her prayers when suddenly, lightning and thunder crash outside, startling her. The door creaks open and as Jamie gets up to close it, the reflection of Michael, donned in his classic white mask and black coveralls, appears in the mirror. Jamie returns to her bed and instantly, Michael's hand reaches out from under the bed and grabs her by the leg. Jamie struggles, gets loose, and runs to her closet.

It is common in Asia, India (7% of intestinal obstruction) and especially South India because of the high fibre diet. It is very common cause of large bowel obstruction in Peru and Bolivia due to high altitude. Hypothesis: Sigmoid colon volvulus is a cause of constipation. pick from the following. +Yes. +It's impossible to say. +No.","completion":"+Yes. The context provided does support the hypothesis that Sigmoid colon volvulus is a cause of constipation. The context states that Sigmoid colon volvulus is a common cause of bowel obstruction and constipation. This intestinal condition involves a twist in the bowel, particularly the sigmoid colon, causing a blockage. When this happens, it prevents the normal passage of digested food and waste, which would characterize as constipation or bowel obstruction. The context further establishes that this condition is prevalent in regions like Asia, particularly India, and South America, notably Peru and Bolivia. The high occurrence rate in these locations is attributed to specific local factors such as dietary habits and environmental conditions. In South India, the high fiber diet shared among the population is a possible implication for the commonality of sigmoid colon volvulus since the excessive consumption of fiber can lead to gastrointestinal issues not limited to constipation. Similarly, high altitude regions like Peru and Bolivia see high instances of this condition, which contribute to large bowel obstruction within such populations. However, it is crucial to indicate that while sigmoid colon volvulus can indeed cause constipation, it is not the sole cause. Many other factors can lead to constipation, such as a less active lifestyle, certain medications, a lack of adequate hydration, and more. Therefore, somebody suffering from constipation does not automatically indicate the presence of sigmoid colon volvulus. It is one of the severe categorizations of constipation causes leading to a medical emergency if not remedied in time. Diagnosis and intervention by a healthcare professional would be necessary to ascertain the cause and appropriate treatment for constipation.

Background: Andrea Jane Corr MBE (born 17 May 1974) is an Irish musician, songwriter, and actress. Corr debuted in 1990 as the lead singer of the Celtic folk rock and pop rock group The Corrs along with her three elder siblings Caroline, Sharon, and Jim. Aside from singing lead vocals Corr plays the tin whistle, the ukulele, and the piano. Context: While her siblings were on hiatus to raise their families, Andrea launched a solo career. She released her first album, Ten Feet High, on 25 June 2007. It was produced by Nellee Hooper, who has worked with Gwen Stefani and Madonna; Bono was an executive producer. Her first single, \\"Shame on You\\" was an up-tempo pop song about men and women going to war and leaving behind partners they may never see again. It received positive reviews from music critics; IndieLondon described the song as a \\"slick package\\" that was \\"polished, well produced and with a message that's difficult to ignore\\". Losing Today's David Adair gave the song a strong review, writing that Corr's vocals were \\"crisp and uplifting\\". Liverpool's Daily Post gave the song a three-star rating, commenting that it was \\"deceptively upbeat\\", which masked its \\"heavier message about conscription and war\\". On 10 April 2009 Andrea announced on Claudia Winkleman's BBC Radio 2 show that she would be releasing a second album of old songs and covers. She spoke of her disappointment and how 'gutted' she had been when her 2007 album Ten Feet High had failed to gain commercial success. She also spoke at length of her experiences while acting in the play Dancing at Lughnasa and how it has given her hope for upcoming projects, including a second solo album of 'old songs'. In late January 2011, her new album was announced for \\"early summer\\", and a downloadable MP3 of her cover of John Lennon's Number 9 Dream was made available to subscribers. Lifelines was released on 30 May. In the summer of 2012, she re-recorded the track \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" (which had first appeared on her album \\"Lifelines\\") with German electronic musician Christopher von Deylen, better known under his alias Schiller. It was released in Germany on 5 October on the Schiller album Sonne. Question: What did she announce on BBC Radio 2?.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when did charles dickens live Suggested answer: His novels, most published in monthly or weekly instalments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"While the suggested answer provides some valuable information about Charles Dickens and the novel publication methods during the Victorian era, it does not directly answer the specific question you posed, which is regarding the time period in which Charles Dickens lived. Therefore, I would recommend not validating this particular answer, as it does not accurately address the inquiry. To provide a more appropriate response to the question \\"when did Charles Dickens live?\\": Charles Dickens was an English writer and social critic who lived from February 7, 1812, to June 9, 1870. Known as one of the most important authors of the Victorian era, Dickens wrote numerous well-regarded novels, including \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" \\"Great Expectations,\\" and \\"A Christmas Carol.\\" His works often explored themes of social injustice and the struggles faced by the poor. As the given answer mentioned, Dickens' novels were primarily published in serialized formats, which were released as either monthly or weekly installments. This method of publishing allowed literature to reach a wider audience, making it more accessible and affordable for the lower and middle classes. Serialization also contributed to the popularity and anticipation of new installments, which generated further interest in current events and social issues of the time. In conclusion, while the original suggested answer is relevant to Charles Dickens and his influence on novel publication during the Victorian era, it does not directly answer the question about when he lived. To better guide future responses, it would be helpful to focus on providing accurate and relevant information that addresses the specific question being asked."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Before dying, Barts reveals that Sturgess is also a vampire. Lincoln confronts Sturgess, who reveals that, several years ago, he was attacked and bitten by Adam.

Here is an article: James Blake lost his cool and cursed ESPN analyst Pam Shriver while losing his first-round match in straight sets to Robin Haase at Wimbledon today. It was a low point for the world's former No. 4, who has sunk to 109, but it also was an embarrassing and unprofessional moment for Shriver. The commentary from Shriver, a veteran of numerous grand slam tournaments as a player, could be heard on court. Blake pointed that out in mid-match, just after she had criticized his game. \\"Amazing you used to play tennis,\\" Blake yelled up. \\"I can still hear you.\\" Shriver didn't lower her volume, and went on to say, \\"James just yelled at me . . . I'm way above the court, but evidently he can hear me. He's got rabbit ears.\\" Well, yeah. It's Wimbledon, and the slightest bit of yammering draws a request for silence from the chair umpire. That part of the game hasn't changed since Shriver won her 21 grand slam doubles titles with Martina Navratilova, from 1981-91. After the next point, Blake yelled, \\"You have to be an ass about it, too? . . . And act like I'm at fault.\\" Shriver again failed to retreat, saying, \\"And there he is, talking again.

If we suppose that a bat listens for the sound waves returning to them but somehow cannot interpret or perceive them, this perturbation directly impacts the crucial step of listening for returning echoes in the echolocation process. Without the ability to interpret or perceive the returning echoes, the bat would lose the essential information they need to locate and avoid objects. This lack of vital information disrupts the echolocation process and puts the bat at risk of colliding with objects in their environment, thus directly impacting a step of the process."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Have you ever wanted to stop eating something sweet but you just couldn't ?Is the first thing you do wehn you get home from schol to look in the biscuit tin ?Can you eat a huge bar of chocolate all by yourself ?Can you say \\"no\\"to sweets at parties ?If you can't ,thenn there is a reason ...perhapos you are a sugar addict !Does that sound funny ?Well ,doctors say that people who eat sweets regularly can easily becoame addicted to sugar .What's more ,most sugar addicts don't even realize that they are addicted !Sugar addiction is serious becauase it can really _ your health .doctors say that we should eat food which is healthy such as fresh fruits and vegetables,and that we shouldn't eat a lot of sugar ,fat or fast food .But sugar addicts can't follow this advice .They know they must stop eating sweet food,bu htey can't .

Answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Have both St Albans Cathedral and All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne served multiple purposes in the past? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, I will have to research individually about St Albans Cathedral and All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne. This includes finding out about their historical significance, their functional changes over the centuries, and their present status. 1. Starting with St Albans Cathedral: St Albans Cathedral, also known as the Cathedral and Abbey Church of St Alban, is a Church of England cathedral church at St Albans, England. It was originally an abbey church that became a cathedral in 1877, and it's one of the oldest churches in England. Early records suggest that it was used for religious purposes, as a place of worship and pilgrimage. But during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, monastic institutions were closed, and its lands and properties were taken by the Crown. The abbey church became part of the new diocese of St Albans in 1877 and was then used also as a cathedral, marking a dual-purpose in its history. 2. Moving to All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne: All Saints' Church is a Church of England parish church in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne. It's one of the city's most iconic landmarks. Historically, it served as a place of worship. However, due to a dwindling congregation, the church was declared redundant in 1961. It was then passed to the care of the Churches Conservation Trust and has been used not only as a place for regular worship but also for concerts, exhibitions, and private events, indicating that this church, too, has served multiple purposes. In conclusion: Yes, both St Albans Cathedral and All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne, have indeed served multiple purposes in the past. They have functioned as places of worship and at different times have adopted new purposes like serving as a cathedral and a venue for events. Their purposes have evolved in response to the changing cultural, religious, and social contexts they exist within."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Information: - Field artillery is a category of mobile artillery used to support armies in the field. These weapons are specialized for mobility, tactical proficiency, long range, short range and extremely long range target engagement. - Infantry is the general branch of an army that engages in military combat on foot. As the troops who engage with the enemy in close-ranged combat, infantry units bear the largest brunt of warfare and typically suffer the greatest number of casualties during a military campaign. Historically, as the oldest branch of the combat arms, the infantry are the tip of the spear of a modern army, and continually undergo training that is typically more physically demanding and psychologically stressful than that of any other branch of the combat arms. Common representations of infantry fighting forces include the U.S. Army Infantry Branch, U.S. Marine Corps Infantry, Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, Infantry of the British Army, and the Royal Australian Corps of Infantry. - Artillery is a class of large military weapons built to fire munitions far beyond the range and power of infantry's small arms. Early artillery development focused on the ability to breach fortifications, and led to heavy, fairly immobile siege engines. As technology improved, lighter, more mobile field artillery developed for battlefield use. This development continues today; modern self-propelled artillery vehicles are highly mobile weapons of great versatility providing the largest share of an army's total firepower. - Fortifications are military constructions or buildings designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and also used to solidify rule in a region during peace time. Humans have constructed defensive works for many thousands of years, in a variety of increasingly complex designs. The term is derived from the Latin \\"fortis\\" (\\"strong\\") and \\"facere\\" (\\"to make\\"). - A siege is a military blockade of a city or fortress with the intent of conquering by attrition or assault. This derives from \\"sedere\\", Latin for \\"to sit\\". Siege warfare is a form of constant, low-intensity conflict characterized by one party holding a strong, static defensive position. Consequently, an opportunity for negotiation between combatants is not uncommon, as proximity and fluctuating advantage can encourage diplomacy. - A tractor unit (prime mover or traction unit) is a characteristically heavy-duty towing engine that provides motive power for hauling a towed or trailered load. These fall into two categories: very heavy-duty typically off-road capable, often 6×6, military and commercial tractor units, including ballast tractors, and heavy and medium duty military and commercial rear-wheel drive \\"semi tractors\\" used for hauling semi-trailers. - A ballast tractor is a specially weighted tractor unit of a heavy hauler combination. It is designed to utilize a drawbar to pull or push heavy or exceptionally large trailored loads. When feasible, lowboy-style semi-trailers are used to minimize a load's center of gravity. Typical drivetrains are 6×4 and 6×6. - In international arms control, small arms include revolvers and pistols, rifles and carbines, assault rifles, submachine guns and light machine guns. Together with light weapons (heavy machine guns; hand-held grenade launchers; portable anti-aircraft and anti-tank guns; recoilless rifles; portable launchers of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile systems; and mortars of calibres of less than 100 mm), they comprise the Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) protocol. - A half-track is a civilian or military vehicle with regular wheels at the front for steering and continuous tracks at the back to propel the vehicle and carry most of the load. The purpose of this combination is to produce a vehicle with the cross-country capabilities of a tank and the handling of a wheeled vehicle. - Self-propelled artillery (also called mobile artillery or locomotive artillery) is artillery equipped with its own propulsion system to move towards its target. Within the term are covered self-propelled guns (or howitzers) and rocket artillery. They are high mobility vehicles, usually based on continuous tracks carrying either a large howitzer, field gun, a mortar or some form of rocket or missile launcher. They are usually used for long-range indirect bombardment support on the battlefield. - A semi-trailer (British English) or semitrailer (American English) is a trailer without a front axle. In the US, the term is also used to refer to the combination of a truck and a semi-trailer, a tractor-trailer. - An artillery tractor , also referred to as a gun tractor , is a specialized heavy - duty form of tractor unit used to tow artillery pieces of varying weights and calibres . It may be wheeled , tracked , or half - tracked . - A siege engine is a device that is designed to break or circumvent city walls and other fortifications in siege warfare. Some have been operated close to the fortifications, while others have been used to attack from a distance. From antiquity, siege engines were constructed largely of wood and tended to use mechanical advantage to fling stones and similar missiles. With the development of gunpowder and improved metallurgical techniques, siege engines became artillery. Collectively, siege engines or artillery together with the necessary troops and transport vehicles to conduct a siege are referred to as a siege-train. What object entity has the relation of 'subclass of' with the subject 'artillery tractor'? Choices: - ability - arms control - army - artillery - blockade - branch - city - class - combat - device - diplomacy - field - fortress - gravity - grenade - gun - infantry - latin - light - locomotive - machine - military - military vehicle - missile - mortar - number - own - party - position - power - protocol - range - road - rocket - siege engine - style - support - system - time - tractor - trailer - truck - warfare Answer:","completion":"military vehicle"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lewis Hamilton will start the first ever Russian Grand Prix in pole position after coming out on top in Saturday's tense qualifying session. The Mercedes driver has been on dazzling form in recent weeks, winning consecutive races in Italy, Singapore and Japan to climb atop the overall driver's standings, and his hot streak continued in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi. Hamilton clocked a fastest lap of one minute, 38.338 seconds but was made to sweat by the Williams of Valtteri Bottas who looked set to trump that time only to skid off at the very end of the third qualifying run. The slip ensured the Finn finished third fastest behind Hamilton's teammate and title rival Nico Rosberg. McLaren's Jenson Button will begin the race from fourth position ahead of the Toro Rosso of home favourite Daniil Kvyat who edged out Kevin Magnusson of McLaren and Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull. \\"Pole is a great place to start,\\" Hamilton told the waiting press after coming off the track. \\"It wasn't the easiest of sessions. Rosberg and Bottas were looking quite strong and hooking up a good lap wasn't the same as practice. It will be tough tomorrow in the race. It is a long way down to turn one. We'll see how that works out.\\" Elsewhere on the track, Fernando Alonso clocked the eighth fastest time just ahead of Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen. Four-time world Champion Sebastian Vettel, meanwhile, will start in eleventh position after failing to make the final qualifying run. \\"I wasn't comfortable in the car today. It was very difficult,\\" Vettel said. \\"The car felt nervous, so I couldn't take the speed into the corners, I lost the rear many times around the lap and therefore wasn't quick enough.\\" The day's qualifying took place under calm, sunny conditions that were in stark contrast to the heavy rain a week earlier in Japan that led to Marussia driver Jules Bianchi suffering a severe head injury. The 25-year-old Frenchman remains in hospital in Yokkaichi and a number of drivers spoke earlier this week about the difficulty of competing again so soon after such a traumatic incident. Hamilton said he was praying for the Frenchman while all 21 drivers have put the words \\"Tous avec Jules #17\\" on their helmets this weekend to show their support. Bianchi's Marussia teammate, Max Chilton, took to the track Saturday but finished the day in 21st position and will start last on the grid Sunday. He later described the emotions he and his team felt and the difficulties of trying to focus on racing under the circumstances. \\"(It's been) a tough weekend and one that hasn't got any easier as we've progressed towards the race,\\" Chilton said. \\"I'm grateful for having the whole Team around me as I think that it is helping all of us to focus. \\"Performance-wise, we didn't get the qualifying position we wanted today, but there are some reasons for that. \\"We'll keep pushing hard this evening, and do our best to get ahead of the Caterhams tomorrow, but the fact is, it's not the same without my teammate.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Lewis Hamilton secured pole position for the first ever Russian Grand Prix in Sochi after a tense qualifying session.

Because his cancer is caught early, at the first screening, the chance of a cure is greater or lesser? Text: The sooner cancer is treated, the greater the chances of a cure. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided text, it can be inferred that the sooner cancer is detected and treated, the greater the chances are of a successful cure. In Don's case, his cancer is caught at the first screening, which means it is likely detected early in its development. This early detection allows for more effective treatment options and an increased likelihood of successfully eliminating the cancer from his body. Since the text emphasizes the importance of early treatment in increasing the chances of a cure, it can be concluded that Don's greater chance of a cure is directly related to the cancer being caught early at the first screening. Early detection plays a critical role in ensuring better treatment outcomes and improving a patient's overall prognosis.

Q: In 1974, at the Glensville Sanatorium in West Virginia, three deformed patients known as the Hillicker Brothers escape from their cells and release the other patients; together they massacre the orderlies and the doctors.Twenty-nine years later in 2003, nine Weston University students: Kenia (Jennifer Pudavick), Jenna (Terra Vnesa), Vincent (Sean Skene), Sara (Tenika Davis), Bridget (Kaitlyn Leeb), Kyle (Victor Zinck, Jr.), Claire (Samantha Kendrick), Daniel (Dean Armstrong) and Lauren (Ali Tataryn), are snowmobiling, on their way to their friend Porter's cabin in the mountains. However, they get lost in a snowstorm and are forced to take shelter in the Glensville Sanatorium for the night, where the Hillickers are living. Lauren remembers her brother's stories about the sanatorium and the cannibalistic Hillickers, but her friends don't believe her. As the group goes to bed, Vincent continues to explore the asylum, where he finds Porter's corpse before being killed by Saw Tooth.The next day, with the storm still in full effect, the teens remain trapped and go in search of Vincent. Jenna comes across the Hillickers butchering Porter's body in the kitchen, and runs back to warn the others. After Porter's severed head is thrown at the group, Claire is hung from a balcony with barbed wire by the trio and decapitated. The group attempts to flee the building, but find their snowmobiles have been sabotaged. Lauren skis down the mountain to seek help, while the others barricade themselves in a doctor's office.Kyle, Daniel, and Sara go into the basement to get weapons but Daniel gets abducted, tied to a table in the kitchen, and then slowly eaten alive. The rest of the group chases the cannibals and locks them in a cell; Kyle stays behind to watch them while the others search for spark-plugs for the snowmobiles. When Kyle falls asleep, the brothers escape their cell and the girls accidentally stab Kyle to death after he has his tongue cut out and is dressed up like one of the Hillickers. The cannibals appear and chase the girls through the building, forcing them to climb out of a window; Jenna gets stuck and is impaled with a ground driller by Saw Tooth. The Hillickers chase the girls on the snowmobiles, where Kenia gets injured and Bridget gets crushed under one of them by One Eye.As the day dawns, Lauren has frozen to death in the storm. Kenia is still being chased by One Eye when Sara reappears and knocks him off the snowmobile, allowing the pair to steal it. As they gleefully drive away, they are simultaneously decapitated by a strip of barbed wire.

After realizing that such technology, contained within a wristwatch frame, could also be used against the USA, the NSA orders the project stopped. However, the research is farther along than the NSA expected and Henry Gates, the head of QT, plans on using the technology to usurp the leader of the NSA and dominate the world. He uses the prototype to stretch the weekend in order to give the brilliant lead scientist, Earl Dopler, time to fix the remaining glitch in the technology after his henchmen Richard and Jay prevent Earl's incognito departure at the airport. However, the disadvantage of Earl being in Hypertime for too long was him aging rapidly in real time, as his molecular age continued at the same rate despite time slowing down.However, initially unknown to Gates, the lead scientist had sent a prototype to a former colleague of his named Dr. Gibbs. His son Zak discovers the watch accidentally and initially uses it for his own purpose, much to Francesca's amusement. Once Gates finds out about the leaked prototype, he attempts to retrieve it.

Background: Duke was born in New York City, the only child of tobacco and hydroelectric power tycoon James Buchanan Duke and his second wife, Nanaline Holt Inman, widow of Dr. William Patterson Inman. At his death in 1925, the elder Duke's will bequeathed the majority of his estate to his wife and daughter, along with 17 million in two separate clauses of the will, to The Duke Endowment he had created in 1924. The total value of the estate was not disclosed, but was estimated variously at 60 million to 100 million (equivalent to 837 million to 1.395 billion in 2018), the majority culled from J.B. Duke's holds in Lucky Strike cigarettes. Duke spent her early childhood at Duke Farms, her father's 2,700-acre (11 km2) estate in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey. Context: Duke's first major philanthropic act was to establish Independent Aid, Inc., in 1934, when she was 21 years old, in order to manage the many requests for financial assistance addressed to her. In 1958, she established the Duke Gardens Foundation to endow the public display gardens she started to create at Duke Farms. Her Foundation intended that Duke Gardens \\"reveal the interests and philanthropic aspirations of the Duke family, as well as an appreciation for other cultures and a yearning for global understanding.\\". Duke Gardens were the center of a controversy over the decision by the trustees of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation to close them on May 25, 2008. In 1968, Duke created the Newport Restoration Foundation with the goal of preserving more than eighty colonial buildings in the town. Historic properties include Rough Point, Samuel Whitehorne House, Prescott Farm, the Buloid-Perry House, the King's Arms Tavern, the Baptist Meetinghouse, and the Cotton House. Seventy-one buildings are rented to tenants. Only five function as museums. She also funded the construction of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India, visited by the Beatles in 1968. Duke's extensive travels led to an interest in a variety of cultures, and during her lifetime she amassed a considerable collection of Islamic and Southeast Asian art. After her death, numerous pieces were donated to The Asian Art Museum of San Francisco and the Walters Art Museum of Baltimore. Duke did much additional philanthropic work and was a major benefactor of medical research and child welfare programs. In the late 1980s, Duke donated 2 million to Duke University to be used for AIDS research. Her foundation, Independent Aid, became the Doris Duke Foundation, which still exists as a private grant-making entity. After her death, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation was established in 1996, supporting four national grant making programs and Doris Duke's three estates, Shangri La, Rough Point, and Duke Farms. Question: What is Philanthropy?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Philanthropy is the act of promoting the welfare of others by donating time, money, resources, or expertise to support various causes or initiatives that aim to improve the quality of life for individuals and communities. It involves a genuine concern for the well-being of others and a commitment to creating positive social change. Philanthropists often support organizations, projects, and programs that address a wide range of issues, such as education, healthcare, poverty alleviation, human rights, environmental conservation, arts and culture, and scientific research. The scope of philanthropy can range from local initiatives to global efforts, with the focus on long-term sustainable impact. Doris Duke's long history of philanthropic activities serves as a prime example of how an individual can use their resources and influence to support causes and initiatives that align with their values or interests. From the establishment of Independent Aid, Inc. in 1934, to funding the construction of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in India, Duke dedicated her life to using her wealth and influence to create positive change in various communities and disciplines. Duke's philanthropic works included the establishment of the Duke Gardens Foundation, which aimed to support public display gardens and foster global understanding; the creation of the Newport Restoration Foundation, focused on preserving and restoring historical properties; and significant contributions to medical research, child welfare programs, and art collections. Her continued legacy is reflected in the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, which carries on her philanthropic vision through national grant-making programs and maintaining her preserved estates. In summary, philanthropy involves the selfless dedication to improving the lives of others and supporting causes that promote positive change. It encompasses activities like donating resources, volunteering time, and advocating for social or environmental issues, all with the intent to help make the world a better place for everyone. Doris Duke serves as an inspiring example of what an individual can achieve through a life of committed philanthropy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: The story follows the sexual exploits of two Amherst College roommates over a 25-year period, from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, Jonathan objectifies women. He frequently uses the term \\"ballbuster\\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure as he sees it is to deny pleasure to men. Since each man's perspective of womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman. The film has three parts.

Question: suppose human intervention is lowered happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"more. If human intervention is lowered, it will generally have a positive effect on butterfly populations and lead to more butterflies. The second effect mentioned in the process was the hatching of the egg and the emergence of the larva (caterpillar). The supposed perturbation, in this case, the reduction of human intervention, would likely have a more significant effect on the outcome. There are several reasons why reducing human intervention can lead to more butterflies and influence the hatching process: 1. Habitat preservation: Reducing human intervention often means creating and maintaining more natural habitats for butterflies. These habitats provide essential resources for the insects, such as host plants for laying eggs, places for the larvae to safely hatch, and accessible food sources for caterpillars, which are critical for their growth. 2. Reduction in pesticide use: Lowering human intervention also implies the reduced use of pesticides, which can be harmful to butterflies in various life stages. Pesticides can directly kill eggs, larvae, or adult butterflies. They can also lead to the loss of necessary host plants or negatively impact the availability of food resources for caterpillars. 3. Increased biodiversity: When human intervention decreases, it creates more biodiversity in ecosystems. Greater biodiversity allows for healthier and more resilient ecosystems. Consequently, this encourages larger butterfly populations by providing better foraging opportunities for adult butterflies and better host plants for egg-laying and larval development. 4. Support for natural predators: Reduced human intervention supports the survival of predators that prey on pests, providing a more balanced ecosystem. This balance can help manage pest populations that could be detrimental to butterflies or their host plants. Reducing human intervention ultimately benefits butterfly populations by positively impacting their life cycles, starting from egg-laying to the hatching process and beyond. The preservation of natural habitats, decrease in pesticide use, increased biodiversity, and support for natural predators all contribute to the growth and success of butterfly populations, leading to a more significant effect on the second aspect mentioned, the hatching of the egg and the emergence of the larva."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The popular hiking trails that run along the coastline attract countless visitors every year, awed by the natural beauty and panoramic views of the area. However, the allure of these captivating rock formations can sometimes prove fatal, as their treacherous cliff edges and strong winds pose significant risks to those who dare approach too closely. The cliffs' grim history of past accidents and casualties serve as a somber testament to the danger they present.

Betty accused Jennifer of being a flirt because she was always touching men's arms.","completion":"Step 1: Identify the main characters and context of the story. The primary characters in the story are Betty and Jennifer. The context involves Betty accusing Jennifer of being a flirt. The basis for this accusation is that Jennifer frequently touches men's arms. Step 2: Build upon the established context and characterizations. All right, let's continue with the story. Jennifer, in her usual calm demeanor, remained unfazed by Betty's accusation. \\"There's a difference between being friendly and being flirtatious, Betty,\\" Jennifer said nonchalantly while flipping her glossy hair with an air of indifference. She didn't feel the need to alter her behavior. After all, it was her nature to indulge in a tactile form of communication. How was she to blame if Betty misconstrued it as flirting? Step 3: Introduce counter-argument or conflict. Betty, oblivious to Jennifer's logic, growled in response. As far as she was concerned, there was no need for such physical contact. Nevertheless, Jennifer's actions had sparked a bitter rivalry between the pair. Their once blossoming friendship started withering, and a tension-filled cloud began to fill their shared spaces. They found their conversations constantly riddled with sarcasm and undertones of anger. Step 4: Progress the story. Over time, Jennifer eventually became aware of the depth of Betty's disdain. She made an effort to be mindful of her actions, especially when they were together. Yet, she could not fully suppress her habitual way of connecting with people. This sparked further frustration between Jennifer and Betty, with the former feeling constrained and the latter feeling disrespected. Step 5: Build a climactic situation. One day, during a social gathering, they found themselves in a heated confrontation, drawing the attention of those around them. Jennifer, tired of the constant nagging, finally challenged Betty. \\"If you think it's such a problem, then why don't you prove it? Prove that I am crossing a line!\\" Step 6: Ensure there is a cliffhanger or unresolved conflict for future development. Betty was left stunned, unable to respond immediately to Jennifer's challenge. The crowd around them fell silent, waiting for Betty's reaction. Would she be able to substantiate her claims against Jennifer, or will this confrontation serve as a testament to Jennifer's innocence? With each of these steps, the story has been elaborated while maintaining consistency with the initial scenario. The characters have been developed, a conflict has been introduced, and the story has also been left open-ended for potential future continuation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: gambling bill fails to clear legislative floor Text:","completion":"Title: Legislative Floor Halts Progress of Gambling Bill, Future Remains Uncertain The much-debated gambling bill faced a significant hurdle as it failed to clear the legislative floor recently. The proposal, which was expected to bring significant changes to the gambling landscape, met opposition from various groups and lawmakers, resulting in its setback. The gambling bill had been gathering attention and support for several months, as it aimed to introduce new regulations and possibilities for the industry. Its potential benefits included increased revenue for the state and an expansion of employment opportunities within the gambling sector. However, not everyone agreed on these positive outcomes. Many lawmakers and community groups expressed concerns about the possible negative effects arising from the potential bill's passage. Some of the key arguments made against it revolved around the fear of increased gambling addiction, negative outcomes for low-income households, and potential growth in crime rates around gambling establishments. As the bill failed to secure the necessary votes on the legislative floor, it will now face an uncertain future. Proponents of the bill will need to strategize and potentially revise parts of the legislation in order to garner more support. Meanwhile, opponents will continue to emphasize their concerns and rally for alternative solutions to address the potential social and economic challenges that the expansion of gambling could bring. In the coming months, the fate of the gambling bill will likely be influenced by further negotiations, public opinion, and potential shifts in the political landscape. For now, the state's gambling industry will remain unchanged as lawmakers and stakeholders continue to grapple with the right approach to balance potential economic benefits with social concerns. In conclusion, the gambling bill's failure to clear the legislative floor signals the ongoing struggle to determine the future of gambling in the region. While its proponents argue its potential benefits, opponents maintain valid concerns regarding the negative impacts it could have on society. Its ultimate success or failure depends on addressing these challenges while navigating the ever-changing political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Solve this instance: TIP48 and TIP49 are two related and highly conserved eukaryotic AAA(+) proteins with an essential biological function and a critical role in major pathways that are closely linked to cancer. They are found together as components of several highly conserved chromatin-modifying complexes. Both proteins show sequence homology to bacterial RuvB but the nature and mechanism of their biochemical role remain unknown. Recombinant human TIP48 and TIP49 were assembled into a stable high molecular mass equimolar complex and tested for activity in vitro. TIP48/TIP49 complex formation resulted in synergistic increase in ATPase activity but ATP hydrolysis was not stimulated in the presence of single-stranded, double-stranded or four-way junction DNA and no DNA helicase or branch migration activity could be detected. Complexes with catalytic defects in either TIP48 or TIP49 had no ATPase activity showing that both proteins within the TIP48/TIP49 complex are required for ATP hydrolysis. The structure of the TIP48/TIP49 complex was examined by negative stain electron microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstruction at 20 A resolution revealed that the TIP48/TIP49 complex consisted of two stacked hexameric rings with C6 symmetry. The top and bottom rings showed substantial structural differences. Interestingly, TIP48 formed oligomers in the presence of adenine nucleotides, whilst TIP49 did not. The results point to biochemical differences between TIP48 and TIP49, which may explain the structural differences between the two hexameric rings and could be significant for specialised functions that the proteins perform individually.

Jane Austen spent the first 25 years of her life in nearby Steventon where her father was vicar. Sculptor Adam Roud said it represented Austen as a \\"daughter and a sister\\" as she walked through the town. \\"We have all the hoo-ha about Jane Austen the author - and rightly so - but she's a real person and that made me a bit more connected to the idea of her just walking here,\\" he said. The Austen family lived in Steventon until they moved to Bath in 1801. Austen knew Basingstoke well and attended social gatherings at the Assembly Rooms in Market Square and regularly visited family friends at The Vyne, Oakley Hall and Ashe House. Her experiences are thought to have provided her with material for her novels. She wrote drafts for Northanger Abbey, Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice while in Steventon. What Austen actually looked like has been a source of debate among academics. The only confirmed portrait of the author made during her lifetime is by her sister Cassandra.

Answer the above question based on the context below: English-Tamil musician M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) released her second album Kala in 2007, which achieved widespread critical acclaim, and was certified gold in the United States and silver in the United Kingdom. Six months after giving birth to her son Ikyhd in February 2009, she began composing and recording her third studio album in a home studio section of the Los Angeles house she had bought with her partner Ben Bronfman. She used instruments such as the portable dynamic-phrase synthesizer Korg Kaossilator to compose. She took the beat machine and began recording atop Mayan pyramids in Mexico. Much of the work on the album was undertaken at her house in Los Angeles, in what she called a \\"commune environment\\", before it was completed in a rented studio in Hawaii. She collaborated with writer-producer Blaqstarr because, in her opinion, \\"he simply makes good music\\". M.I.A.'s collaboration with Derek E. Miller of Sleigh Bells on the track \\"Meds and Feds\\" prompted her subsequent signing of the band to her label N.E.E.T., and according to Miller, this experience gave him the confidence to record the band's debut album Treats.Her creative partnership with the comparatively unknown Rusko grew from a sense of frustration at what she saw as her now more mainstream associates suggesting sub-standard tracks due to their busy schedules. Diplo worked on the track \\"Tell Me Why\\", but at a studio in Santa Monica rather than at the house. He claimed in an interview that, following the break-up of his personal relationship with M.I.A. some years earlier, he was not allowed to visit the house because \\"her boyfriend really hates me\\".Tracks for the album were whittled down from recording sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting \\"carried away\\" in the studio, appreciating the \\"mad distorted and hectic\\" sound they were able to create.

Write a summary based on this article: The chocolate deficit is about to go way up. (AP Photo/Dan Goodman, File) There's no easy way to say this: You're eating too much chocolate, all of you. And it's getting so out of hand that the world could be headed towards a potentially disastrous (if you love chocolate) scenario if it doesn't stop. Those are, roughly speaking, the words of two huge chocolate makers, Mars, Inc. and Barry Callebaut. And there's some data to back them up. Chocolate deficits, whereby farmers produce less cocoa than the world eats, are becoming the norm. Already, we are in the midst of what could be the longest streak of consecutive chocolate deficits in more than 50 years. It also looks like deficits aren't just carrying over from year-to-year—the industry expects them to grow. Last year, the world ate roughly 70,000 metric tons more cocoa than it produced. By 2020, the two chocolate-makers warn that that number could swell to 1 million metric tons, a more than 14-fold increase; by 2030, they think the deficit could reach 2 million metric tons. The problem is, for one, a supply issue. Dry weather in West Africa (specifically in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, where more than 70 percent of the world's cocoa is produced) has greatly decreased production in the region. A nasty fungal disease known as frosty pod hasn't helped either. The International Cocoa Organization estimates it has wiped out between 30 percent and 40 percent of global cocoa production. Because of all this, cocoa farming has proven a particularly tough business, and many farmers have shifted to more profitable crops, like corn, as a result. Then there's the world's insatiable appetite for chocolate. China's growing love for the stuff is of particular concern. The Chinese are buying more and more chocolate each year. Still, they only consume per capita about 5 percent of what the average Western European eats. There's also the rising popularity of dark chocolate, which contains a good deal more cocoa by volume than traditional chocolate bars (the average chocolate bar contains about 10 percent, while dark chocolate often contains upwards of 70 percent). For these reasons, cocoa prices have climbed by more than 60 percent since 2012, when people started eating more chocolate than the world could produce. And chocolate makers have, in turn, been forced to adjust by raising the price of their bars. Hershey's was the first, but others have followed suit. Efforts to counter the growing imbalance between the amount of chocolate the world wants and the amount farmers can produce has inspired a bit of much needed innovation. Specifically, an agricultural research group in Central Africa is developing trees that can produce up to seven times the amount of beans traditional cocoa trees can. The uptick in efficiency, however, might be compromising taste, says Bloomberg's Mark Schatzker. He likens the trade-off to other mass-produced commodities. Efforts are under way to make chocolate cheap and abundant -- in the process inadvertently rendering it as tasteless as today’s store-bought tomatoes, yet another food, along with chicken and strawberries, that went from flavorful to forgettable on the road to plenitude. It's unclear anyone will mind a milder flavor if it keeps prices down. And the industry certainly won't mind, so long as it keeps the potential for a gargantuan shortage at bay. ||||| In the Asia-Pacific region, home to more than half the world’s population and 12 percent of chocolate demand, each person will eat 200 grams (0.4 pounds) in 2014, double the amount of a decade earlier, according to Euromonitor International Ltd.

Read More In the Asia-Pacific region, home to more than half the world’s population and 12 percent of chocolate demand, each person will eat 200 grams (0.4 pounds) in 2014, double the amount of a decade earlier, according to Euromonitor International Ltd. Close Global cocoa supplies are headed for the longest production shortfall in more than five decades as chocolate demand surges in Asia. Cocoa use will top output by about 70,000 metric tons in the 12 months started Oct. 1 and deficits will persist through 2018, a six-year stretch that would be the longest since the data began in 1960, said Laurent Pipitone, head of statistics at the International Cocoa Organization in London. Prices may rally 15 percent to 3,200 a ton by the end of 2014, according to the median of 14 trader estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Global sales of chocolate confectionary will gain 2.1 percent to a record 7.3 million tons next year, after a 2 percent gain in 2013, estimates Euromonitor International Ltd. Sales in China more than doubled in the past decade, outpacing gains in Western Europe, the biggest consumer. Tighter supplies will mean higher costs for food makers including Nestle SA, Barry Callebaut AG and Lindt & Spruengli AG. “Demand for chocolate is great,” said Ashmead Pringle, the president of Atlanta-based GreenHaven Commodity Services, which oversees about 340 million. “A lot of the world population is moving to the middle class and will have more money to spend, in particular in emerging markets and Asia.” Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg A man uses a smartphone outside a Godiva chocolate shop in the Sanlitun area of Beijing.

Cocoa climbed 24 percent this year to 2,771 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. New York, the second-biggest gain among the 24 commodities tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge, which slid 3.4 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 16 percent, while the Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading partners, rose 3 percent. The Bloomberg Treasury Bond Index fell 2.8 percent. Smaller Harvests Dry weather in Ivory Coast and Ghana, the biggest cocoa growers, drove price gains this year even as most commodities slumped. Commerzbank estimates the production declines in West Africa mean this year’s deficit may exceed 100,000 tons, or 43 percent more than the ICCO forecast. Cocoa beans are processed into butter and powder used to make chocolate. In the Asia-Pacific region, home to more than half the world’s population and 12 percent of chocolate demand, each person will eat 200 grams (0.4 pounds) in 2014, double the amount of a decade earlier, according to Euromonitor. Sales in China will rise 6.9 percent to a record 193,100 tons this year and expand 6.6 percent further in 2014, the researcher said. Asian demand is dwarfed by the 2.2 million tons eaten last year in Western Europe, where per-capita consumption was unchanged from 10 years earlier at 4.5 kilograms. Euromonitor predicts sales in the region will rise 0.5 percent this year before expanding 0.6 percent next year. ‘Untapped Market’ China is a “huge untapped market” that signals more potential for cocoa-supply shortages, said Claudio Oliveira, the head of trading at Castlestone Management LLC in New York. The world population will expand by 1 billion people over the next 12 years to 8.2 billion, before reaching 9.6 billion by 2050, the United Nations said in a June report. China and India will remain the most-populous nations, and most of the future growth will be in developing countries, the UN said. Farmers in West Africa, which accounts for about 70 percent of world output, are struggling to boost production as aging trees curb yield potential, said Francesco Gibbi, a project manager at the Common Fund for Commodities, set up by the United Nations. In Ghana, the largest grower behind Ivory Coast, old trees that yield fewer beans cover about 30 percent of planted areas, and it takes about three years for new ones to be productive, Gibbi said. The government also said in August it will cut the use of subsidized pesticides by half in the season that began Oct. 1, raising the risk of pest damage that the ICCO said damages as much as 40 percent of the global crop annually. Ample Rains While drier-than-normal weather may have hurt the crop that’s currently being collected, ample precipitation will boost the next harvest. Ivory Coast growers gather cocoa twice annually, with 70 percent of production supplied by the larger main crop and the rest by the mid-crop. In November, the country had as much as double the normal rainfall, helping replenish soil moisture, David Streit, an agricultural meteorologist at Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda, Maryland said in a telephone interview. Ghana had as much as 25 percent above normal rains, he said. Since the start of the season on Oct. 1, bean deliveries to ports in Ivory Coast were estimated to have risen to 711,000 tons as of Dec. 15, from 498,000 tons a year earlier, according to data on the website of KnowledgeCharts, a unit of Commodities Risk Analysis in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. “We’re just finishing harvesting the main crop, and that was very good,” Adrien Koffi Kauadio, who farms 4 hectares (9.9 acres) in Gbogue, Ivory Coast, said in a Dec. 11 interview in London. “If the rains come, we could also have a good mid-crop.” Margins Narrow Cocoa accounts for about 10 percent of the average price of a chocolate bar, the ICCO estimates. One ton of cocoa makes about 7,250 chocolate bars of 100-grams (3.5 ounces) each, according to Commodity Risk Analysis. Nestle SA (NESN), the Vevey, Switzerland-based maker of Kit Kat and Crunch bars, said Aug. 8 that profit margins fell in the six months ended June 30 in its confectionery unit amid rising competition and increased spending on marketing in Latin America. Since the end of June, cocoa prices are up 29 percent. Hershey Co. is betting on rising consumption in Asia, building a 250 million confectionery plant in Malaysia, the region’s biggest cocoa grinder, to help meet its revenue target of 10 billion a year by 2017. Chocolate sales in China are now at about 1.5 billion, Chief Executive Officer John Bilbrey said on an earnings conference call in October. Consumer Tastes For Will Papa, the Hershey, Pennsylvania-based company’s head of research and development, meeting that goal will mean tailoring chocolate recipes to consumer taste in China, where the market is dominated by milky candies. Papa employs a team of 12 scientists and product developers in Shanghai to test new products with local residents, he said in an interview. Sales of chocolate confectionary in the Asia-Pacific region will expand 5 percent annually for Minneapolis-based Cargill Inc., Job Leuning, the head of cocoa in Asia, said Dec. 4 in Jakarta. The company is investing 100 million to open a cocoa-bean processing plant in Indonesia, the third-largest grower. The plant is Cargill’s first in Asia, where demand is growing, and will have a capacity of 70,000 tons, he said. Hedge funds still expect more price gains. The net-long position almost doubled in the past year to 77,556 futures and option contracts as Dec. 10, U.S. government data show. That’s within about 7 percent of an all-time high reached in November. Delayed Expansion Farmer compensation in Ivory Coast hasn’t kept up with the gain in futures as most of the crop was sold in the first half of this year, before prices rallied. The government said Oct. 2 that it will pay farmers 3.4 percent more for their beans in the main harvest of the season started in October. That means farmers probably won’t be able to ramp up production until after next year’s harvest, when they’ll receive higher prices and be able to invest in fertilizers and pesticides. Some are planting other crops, including rubber, farmer Kauadio said. Stockpiles of cocoa at warehouses monitored by ICE Futures U.S. tumbled 36 percent since this year’s peak in June and are at the lowest since June 2011. “There’s loads of evidence that the amounts of fertilizer, pesticides and spraying being done in both Ivory Coast and Ghana have fallen,” said Edward George, head of soft-commodities research at Lome, Togo-based lender Ecobank Transnational Inc., which finances the cocoa trade in West Africa. “Cocoa still has a long way to go. If you’ve been watching imports into China of chocolate, cocoa powder, cocoa butter, all that, they are rising exponentially. The trend isn’t changing, it’s just intensifying.” To contact the reporters on this story: Luzi Ann Javier in New York at ljavier@bloomberg.net; Isis Almeida in London at ialmeida3@bloomberg.net; Marvin G.

Although largely commercially self-funded, it is ultimately publicly owned; originally a subsidiary of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the station is now owned and operated by Channel Four Television Corporation, a public corporation of the Department for Culture, Media & Sport, which was established in 1990 and came into operation in 1993. With the conversion of the Wenvoe transmitter group in Wales to digital on 31 March 2010, Channel 4 became a UK-wide TV channel for the first time. - A game show is a type of radio, television, or internet programming genre in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money and/or prizes. Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows. Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television. - A presenter is a person who introduces or hosts television programs (or segments thereof such as an infomercial advertiser) Nowadays, it is common for minor celebrities in other fields to take on this role, but some people have made their name solely within the field of presenting, particularly within children's television series, to become television personalities. - BBC Entertainment is an international television channel broadcasting comedy, drama, light entertainment, reality and children's programming (some regions only) from the BBC, Channel 4 and other UK production houses.

His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box.

Context: With the onset of the Crusades in 1095, and the expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), Jewish migration pushed eastward into Poland (10th century), Lithuania (10th century), and Russia (12th century). Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors: Christian European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as \\"usurious\\" loans) between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.

The 2013 Denver Broncos were coached by which now-coach of the Chicago Bears? Answer:","completion":"The 2013 Denver Broncos were coached by John Fox, who later went on to coach the Chicago Bears from 2015 to 2017. John Fox is a veteran in the field of professional football with nearly 40 years of coaching experience. He kicked off his career in the NFL as an assistant coach with various teams including the San Diego Chargers, Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders. His first head coaching position came in 2002 with the Carolina Panthers, where he led the team to a Super Bowl appearance in the 2003 season. In his nine seasons with the Panthers, Fox had a record of 73–71 (playoffs included). Following his tenure with the Carolina Panthers, Fox was hired as the head coach of the Denver Broncos in 2011. In the 2013 season, Fox led the Broncos to an impressive record of 13–3, winning the AFC West division, and subsequently advancing to Super Bowl XLVIII. Unfortunately, the Broncos fell to the Seattle Seahawks in the final. After parting ways with the Broncos after the 2014 season, Fox was hired as the head coach of the Chicago Bears in 2015. Despite starting off promisingly, Fox's time with the Bears was marred by a string of poor performances and challenges rebuilding the team, resulting in a final record of 14–34 over the course of his three-season tenure. To this day, Fox is highly regarded as a skilled coach adept at team building. His coaching style, which emphasizes tight, defensive gameplay and opportunistic offense, was a staple of his career and allowed him to leave an indelible mark on those teams he served. Although he is presently retired from coaching since 2018, his legacy in the NFL continues to inspire today's and future coaching staff in the NFL."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time.

A:","completion":"No, the given statement does not accurately describe how Frederick tricks Napoleon in \\"Animal Farm.\\" In George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\" Mr. Frederick, who is the owner of a neighboring farm (Pinchfield), tricks Napoleon by purchasing a pile of timber from him. Napoleon becomes increasingly desperate for money to purchase supplies to build a windmill on Animal Farm. To gain these supplies, Napoleon agrees to sell a massive pile of timber to Mr. Frederick, despite being warned by the other pigs that Frederick is untrustworthy. Mr. Frederick pays for the timber with counterfeit money, fooling Napoleon and the animals. Shortly after the transaction, the animals discover that the banknotes are fake, and their supplies are essentially stolen. This act of deceit deeply humiliates Napoleon and puts Animal Farm in a vulnerable position. After acquiring the timber, Mr. Frederick and his men destroy the windmill by blowing it up with explosives. This devastation further exemplifies how Frederick duped Napoleon in order to cause chaos and undermine the animals' efforts to run the farm. Thus, a more suitable answer would be: Mr. Frederick tricks Napoleon in \\"Animal Farm\\" by purchasing timber from him with counterfeit banknotes, ultimately humiliating Napoleon and causing significant damage to the farm's infrastructure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in \\"The House of Seven Corpses,\\" but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway, to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! In Hell House (sorry, I don't remember the actual name of the residence), a bunch of mysterious, unexplained deaths took place long ago; some, like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose small role provides the film's only worthwhile moments), attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. The result comes across like \\"Satan's School for Girls\\" (catchy title; made-for-TV production values; intriguing plot) crossed with \\"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\\" (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is, it's nowhere near as entertaining or fun. \\"The House of Seven Corpses\\" is dead at frame one, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis, dragging us along for every aching second... What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer appears to have watched \\"The House of Seven Corpses\\" with the expectation of an engaging, entertaining horror flick and was sorely disappointed. The reviewer describes the acting performances as 'somnambulant' and labels the script as 'trite', suggesting that they found it uninspiring, dull and lacking originality. The reference to the film being 'dead at frame one' implies that, in the reviewer's opinion, the film never successfully captivated them or sparked their interest, right from the beginning. The usage of the term 'rigor mortis' is a clever wordplay on the film's genre that underscores the reviewer's perspective on how unenjoyable and tedious they found the film to be. The reviewer also compares \\"The House of Seven Corpses\\" unfavorably to \\"Satan's School for Girls\\" and \\"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\\". By stating that the film 'comes across like' these two, the reviewer means that while \\"The House of Seven Corpses\\" attempts to utilize similar storylines or themes, it fails to achieve the entertainment value or intrigue that these productions have. The reviewer doesn't solely criticize the film's scripting or performances, they also take issue with the production value, likening it to a 'low-rent horror flick'. This suggests that they found the overall quality of the film poor and lacking in professional polish or finesse. Even the one saving grace of the film, the performance of 'John Carradine', is described as small, suggesting that it's not enough to salvage the overall experience of the movie.

Q: Abstract: We have used recombinant or synthetic alphaIIb and beta3 integrin cytoplasmic peptides to study their in vitro complexation and ligand binding capacity by surface plasmon resonance. alpha.beta heterodimerization occurred in a 1:1 stoichiometry with a weak KD in the micromolar range. Divalent cations were not required for this association but stabilized the alpha.beta complex by decreasing the dissociation rate. alpha.beta complexation was impaired by the R995A substitution or the KVGFFKR deletion in alphaIIb but not by the beta3 S752P mutation. Recombinant calcium- and integrin-binding protein (CIB), an alphaIIb-specific ligand, bound to the alphaIIb cytoplasmic peptide in a Ca2+- or Mn2+-independent, one-to-one reaction with a KD value of 12 microM. In contrast, in vitro liquid phase binding of CIB to intact alphaIIbbeta3 occurred preferentially with Mn2+-activated alphaIIbbeta3 conformers, as demonstrated by enhanced coimmunoprecipitation of CIB with PAC-1-captured Mn2+-activated alphaIIbbeta3, suggesting that Mn2+ activation of intact alphaIIbbeta3 induces the exposure of a CIB-binding site, spontaneously exposed by the free alphaIIb peptide. Since CIB did not stimulate PAC-1 binding to inactive alphaIIbbeta3 nor prevented activated alphaIIbbeta3 occupancy by PAC-1, we conclude that CIB does not regulate alphaIIbbeta3 inside-out signaling, but rather is involved in an alphaIIbbeta3 post-receptor occupancy event..

Harry Wales, to his mates -- is coming to the U.S. Southwest this week to begin a two-month series of training exercises for British attack helicopter pilots. The Apache crews will train at Naval Air Facility El Centro in California, about 90 miles east of San Diego, officials said. The prince, 27, also will be training at the Gila Bend Air Force Auxiliary Field in southern Arizona. It's part of a two-month series of maneuvers dubbed Exercise Crimson Eagle, in which British fliers will practice with the Apaches in terrain similar to southern Afghanistan, where some British troops are currently based.

Still, it's possible that the prince, like others who train in the area, may frequent area clubs, restaurants, theaters or bowling alleys. The El Centro Chamber of Commerce has asked businesses and restaurants to treat Harry with respect and safeguard his privacy. The prince may also be drawn to outdoor diversions. According to Cathy Kennerson, chief executive officer of the Chamber, the area is known for off-roading, hiking, birdwatching and the Salton Sea, also in the agriculture-rich Imperial Valley.

This momentous achievement is a testament to the success of efforts to expand vaccine availability and highlights the importance of continued vaccination campaigns. Background on Rubella and Its Devastating Effects: Rubella poses a significant threat to unborn children when pregnant women contract the virus in the first trimester of pregnancy. The disease can lead to blindness, deafness, heart defects, and even fetal death. Rubella outbreaks have caused considerable suffering throughout history, with one American epidemic in 1964 and 1965 resulting in the death of 11,000 fetuses and 20,000 children being born with severe birth defects. Eradication Efforts in the Americas: The last endemic cases of rubella in the Americas were reported in Argentina and Brazil in 2009. Health officials have declared that in a \\"historic achievement,\\" the Americas are the first region in the world to be free of the virus. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) says that this milestone has been reached after 15 years of hard work and emphasizes the importance of making vaccines available even in the most remote areas of the continent. Rubella's eradication in the Americas paves the way for further efforts to eliminate other diseases, starting with measles. Future Eradication Plans: Health authorities hope that Europe will become the next region to be declared rubella-free by the end of this year and aim to make the disease extinct worldwide by 2020. Furthermore, the successful eradication of rubella from the Americas serves as a reminder of the power and importance of vaccination campaigns in addressing other infectious diseases. Smallpox is the only infectious human disease to have been completely eradicated, but the global health community is determined to continue making progress in this area. Conclusion: The eradication of rubella from the Americas serves as a prime example of how concerted public health efforts can achieve extraordinary results. This historic milestone highlights the impact of vaccination campaigns in protecting communities from potentially devastating diseases and sets the stage for continued progress in the global fight against infectious diseases."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Tornadoes are nature's most violent storms, which can cause deaths and destroy a neighborhood in seconds. A tornado appears as a funnel-shaped cloud from a thunderstorm to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 miles per hour. Damage paths can be over one mile wide and 50 miles long. Every state is at some risk from this disaster. Some tornadoes can be seen clearly, while rain or nearby low-hanging clouds _ others. At many times, tornadoes develop so rapidly that little, if any, advance warning is possible. Before a tornado hits, the air may become very still. A cloud of debris can mark the location of a tornado even if a funnel can not be seen. Tornadoes generally occur near the edge of a thunderstorm, when the strong wind may die down. It is not uncommon to see clear, sunlit skies behind a tornado. The following are facts about tornadoes: The average forward speed of a tornado is 30 MPH, but may also vary from still to 70 MPH. Debris is picked up or a cloud forms in the funnel. The average tornado moves from southwest to northeast, but tornadoes have been known to move in any direction. Tornadoes are most often reported east of the Rocky Mountains during spring and summer months. Tornadoes can happen together with tropical storms and hurricanes as they move onto land. Waterspouts are tornadoes that form over water. The tornado season in the southern states of America is March through May; in the northern states, it is late spring through early summer. Tornadoes are most likely to occur between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., but can occur at any time. Question: From the passage, where may tornadoes come from? Options: A: Hurricanes. B: Great heat.

It lies in the northern section of the Isthmus of Corinth opposite the island of Salamis, which belonged to Megara in archaic times, before being taken by Athens. Megara was one of the four districts of Attica, embodied in the four mythic sons of King Pandion II, of whom Nisos was the ruler of Megara. Megara was also a trade port, its people using their ships and wealth as a way to gain leverage on armies of neighboring poleis. Megara specialized in the exportation of wool and other animal products including livestock such as horses. It possessed two harbors, Pegae, to the west on the Corinthian Gulf and Nisaea, to the east on the Saronic Gulf of the Aegean Sea. - Thucydides (\\"Thoukudíds\\", ; c. 460 c. 400 BC) was an Athenian historian and general. His \\"History of the Peloponnesian War\\" recounts the 5th century BC war between Sparta and Athens to the year 411 BC. Thucydides has been dubbed the father of \\"scientific history\\" because of his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods, as outlined in his introduction to his work. - Acanthus the Lacedaemonian ( Ancient Greek : ) , was the victor in two footrace events , the diaulos ( ) and dolichos ( ) , in the Olympic Games of 720 BC. He was also , according to some accounts , the first who ran naked in these games . Other accounts ascribe this to Orsippus the Megarian . Thucydides says that the Lacedaemonians were indeed the first who contended naked in gymnastic games , although he does not mention Acanthus by name . - Orsippus was a Greek runner from Megara who was famed as the first to run the footrace naked at the Olympic Games and \\"first of all Greeks to be crowned victor naked.\\" Others argue that it was Acanthus instead who first introduced Greek athletic nudity. Orsippus won the stadion-race of the 15th Olympic Games in 720 BC. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - The History of the Peloponnesian War (Greek: \\"\\") is a historical account of the Peloponnesian War (431404 BC), which was fought between the Peloponnesian League (led by Sparta) and the Delian League (led by Athens). It was written by Thucydides, an Athenian historian who also happened to serve as an Athenian general during the war. His account of the conflict is widely considered to be a classic and regarded as one of the earliest scholarly works of history. The \\"History\\" is divided into eight books. - A historian is a person who researches, studies, and writes about the past, and is regarded as an authority on it. Historians are concerned with the continuous, methodical narrative and research of past events as relating to the human race; as well as the study of all history in time. If the individual is concerned with events preceding written history, the individual is a historian of prehistory. Although \\"historian\\" can be used to describe amateur and professional historians alike, it is reserved more recently for those who have acquired graduate degrees in the discipline. Some historians, though, are recognized by publications or training and experience. \\"Historian\\" became a professional occupation in the late nineteenth century as research universities were emerging in Germany and elsewhere. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Phentermine's effects tend to plateau over time, and many patients develop a resistance to the drug. This is why it is essential that you get on a stable, sustainable diet and exercise plan, even while taking the drug. A healthy diet and regular exercise can allow you to maintain your weight loss or perhaps even continue to lose weight. Phentermine will help you lose weight in those crucial first few weeks, but only diet and exercise will give you long-term success in your weight-loss journey. A licensed dietitian can help you adjust your diet in a way that is both safe and effective for weight loss. Ideally, your dietitian will also be able to monitor your progress to ensure that you are responding well to your new weight-loss regime. Every patient will require a different plan; however, some common weight-loss strategies include: Meal replacements (especially for patients who struggle with portion control) A very-low-calorie diet, often taken in liquid form, under close supervision Lifestyle modification. This can include rather simple changes such as avoiding processed snack foods, eating lots of low-fat proteins and fresh fruits and veggies, and steering clear of alcohol, simple carbohydrates, and sugars. Make sure that you are sticking to your diet plan by keeping track of the calories you consume. Make a list of all the food you eat throughout the day. Using a simple online tool or phone app, you can calculate your daily calories intake. Confirm that your daily calories fit within the diet plan worked out by your dietitian and physician. A food journal (using an app, a website, or just pen and paper) might also be useful. By recording everything you eat, you can learn to resist temptations more readily. Depending on your current weight and health, there are some exercises that might be safer for you to perform than others. Talk with your doctor about some of the best ways for you to integrate exercise into your life in a healthy way. Ideally your exercise plan will allow you to continue losing weight even after you discontinue your use of phentermine. If you cannot exercise strenuously right away, consider low-impact exercise such as swimming, or even walking. You can always work your way up to more strenuous exercises such as running, jogging, or lifting weights. Behavioral therapy is an integral part of medical weight-loss programs. A behavioral specialist can help you stick to your diet and exercise goals. Perhaps you get tempted to eat because of television commercials, or perhaps you overeat when you are stressed out. A behavioral specialist will use cognitive behavioral therapy to retrain your mind to respond to stress and temptation in healthier, more positive ways. This will help you lose weight while on phentermine as well as after you stop taking the appetite suppressant. What is a summary?","completion":"Phentermine is a medicine that helps people lose weight for a short time, but then it stops working. To keep losing weight and stay healthy, it's important to eat a good diet and do exercise. People can see a dietitian, who is someone who knows a lot about food, to help them plan their meals. They should also try different types of exercise and maybe talk to a doctor about what is safe for them. It's a good idea to write down what you eat and how much exercise you do. A behavioral specialist can help you learn new ways to think, so that you don't want to eat too much when you see yummy food on TV or feel upset."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here is a question about this article: This means that a 5% reduction in operating voltage will more than double the life of the bulb, at the expense of reducing its light output by about 16%. This may be a very acceptable trade off for a light bulb that is in a difficult-to-access location (for example, traffic lights or fixtures hung from high ceilings). Long-life bulbs take advantage of this trade-off. Since the value of the electric power they consume is much more than the value of the lamp, general service lamps emphasize efficiency over long operating life. The objective is to minimize the cost of light, not the cost of lamps. Early bulbs had a life of up to 2500 hours, but in 1924 a cartel agreed to limit life to 1000 hours. When this was exposed in 1953, General Electric and other leading American manufacturers were banned from limiting the life.

Solve this math problem Solve 16*w = -14*w + 4*w + 286 for w.","completion":"Hey little buddy! Let's try solving this step by step, like a puzzle: 1. First, we have to combine all the pieces with \\"w\\" on one side. We have -14 * w and 4 * w together. If you had -14 apples and someone gave you 4 apples, you would have -10 apples. So it becomes: 16 * w = -10 * w + 286 2. Now, let's move all the \\"w\\" pieces to one side by adding 10 * w to both sides. We want to bring all the \\"w\\" parts together like a family! 16 * w + 10 * w = -10 * w + 10 * w + 286 3. After adding 10 * w to both sides, it cancels the -10 * w on the right side, and on the left side, we have 16 * w plus 10 * w. If you have 16 toys and add 10 more toys, you'll have 26 toys. Now it looks like this: 26 * w = 286 4. The last step is to find out how many times 26 can fit into 286. This is like sharing 286 candies equally with your 26 friends. To find out, we'll divide 286 by 26: w = 286 / 26 5. When we divide 286 by 26, we find out that it fits 11 times! So, w = 11. So the answer to this puzzle is w = 11!

What are some scientifically proven impossible fossils? What are the different types of fossils? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"I will first answer your questions individually and then address if they are the same or not. 1. Scientifically proven impossible fossils: To determine if a fossil is impossible, it's important to understand the concept of temporal paradoxes. A temporal paradox occurs when a fossil is found in rock layers that are much older or younger than the time period when the organism is known to have existed. Therefore, a scientifically proven impossible fossil would be a fossil that cannot exist based on the current understanding of geologic time and the fossil record. There aren't many examples of such fossils, as the scientific community constantly updates its understanding of Earth's history and the organisms that inhabited it. However, one of the alleged impossible fossils, termed 'Out-of-place artifacts' (OOPArts), is the \\"Coso artifact.\\" It was initially believed to be a 500,000-year-old spark plug encased in a geode (rock with a hollow cavity lined with crystals). However, further research debunked this claim, revealing that it was just a 1920s-era spark plug mistaken as an impossible fossil. 2. Different types of fossils: Fossils can be categorized into several different types based on the method of preservation: a. Permineralization: Minerals replace the original organic material, creating a cast of the creature. Examples include petrified wood and dinosaur bones. b. Carbonization: The organism's remains are compressed, and only a carbon film remains. This is also called carbon film fossils. c. Molds and casts: A mold forms when an organism is buried in sediment, leaving an impression of its body. A cast is made if minerals fill this mold and create a replica of the original organism. d. Amber: Small organisms, like insects, can get trapped in tree sap. Over time, the sap hardens into an amber, preserving the organism inside. e. Trace fossils: These are not actual remains but rather the impression left behind by the organism's activities (e.g., footprints, burrows, and coprolites). 3. Are these questions the same? No, these questions are not the same. The first question is about specific fossils that are believed to be impossible based on our current understanding of geological time and the organisms that have lived in the past. The second question is about the different methods of preservation that result in the various types of fossils we find."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Several posters have quoted Renoir voicing his desire to make a film showing Ingrid Bergman smiling to camera. The short answer is wouldn't we all whilst the harsh reality is that only a select few got to do so. At this stage of her career Bergman couldn't get arrested; in 1949 she left Hollywood to make a picture in Europe, fell for director Roberto Rossellini and never looked forward. After five turkeys in Italy she was probably ready to open a vein but within the year, after making this for Renoir, she was back where she belonged and with an Oscar to boot for Anastasia. This is one of three movies that Renoir made in color around this time and on balance it's better than The Golden Coach, which isn't hard, and about even with French Can Can. Renoir probably figured that with so much going for her Bergman could get away with a couple of wooden leading men and Renoir picked two doozys in Jean Marais and Mel Ferrer, solid mahogany in both cases. The plot is actually based on a real incident in French history but Renoir is content to give it a once-over-lightly and concentrate on replicating the paintings of his father in set up after set up. In its pastel colors it resembles another film of the period Les Grandes Manouvres which is no bad thing. All in all it remains a pleasant trifle showcasing a beautiful and charismatic actress.

Summarize this article: Renault trackside operations director Alan Permane said the engine performed as expected in testing in Spain this week, adding: \\"It looks good.\\" Renault sources had predicted a performance improvement of 0.4-0.5 seconds a lap from the development. The extra power should put Red Bull at Ferrari's level at all tracks. Red Bull's average qualifying deficit to Ferrari over the first five races of the season is 0.454secs - and Red Bull's fastest lap in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix was 0.235secs slower than Ferrari's. Mercedes remain at least a further half-second ahead at the front of the field. Red Bull's Max Verstappen won Sunday's race from Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, after Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crashed out. After testing the new engine on Tuesday, Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, who led the first half of the Spanish race, said: \\"The progress is definitely there. \\"Now to make that next step; that is the last little step we are after to try to really get on Mercedes. But we are getting closer. That is exciting.\\" Renault reserve driver Esteban Ocon added: \\"It is really good. Really good. I can tell it will be quicker for sure.\\" The new power unit is about 30bhp more powerful thanks to a redesign of the combustion of the internal combustion engine, adopting a clever new technology pioneered by Mercedes when turbo hybrid engines were introduced in 2014. The power boost will still leave the Renault - which in the Red Bull is badged after a sponsor - short of the Mercedes and Ferrari engines, which are reputed to be about 50bhp more powerful than the engine Renault have raced so far this year. But in combination with the excellence of the Red Bull chassis - widely regarded as the second best on the grid after Mercedes - it should be enough to reduce the gap to Ferrari to virtually nothing. Media playback is not supported on this device Renault had originally planned the engine's debut for the Canadian Grand Prix on 10-12 June. There is a possibility they could bring that forward to the race in Monaco next week, but no decision has yet been made. Either way, Ricciardo expects the team to perform well in Monaco. \\"Monaco will be our best chance yet,\\" the Australian said. \\"We had a good chance at the weekend - but for pure speed, Monaco should be interesting.\\" Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said after the Spanish Grand Prix that Renault \\"have done a great job in making progress\\". He added: \\"With what's in the pipeline for the coming races, there is a lot of reason for optimism. \\"If we get what's advertised, it is going to put us in a position at least to race Ferrari every weekend.

But last night 14-year-old Anna Ermakova stepped out of Boris Becker's shadow and on to the catwalk as she appeared at Berlin Fashion Week. The tennis star's lovechild was conceived during a scandalous, short-lived and much disputed encounter at the London outpost of celebrity haunt Nobu in 1999. Her mother Angela Ermakova initially claimed the liaison took place in a store cupboard but Becker later confessed they had made love on a staircase between two bathrooms. Scroll down for video It cost my marriage, it cost for the next couple of years my private life but having","completion":"Anna in my life put things in perspective': In a recent interview, Becker, now 49, opened up about the affair and its impact on his marriage to former wife Barbara Feltus, saying that despite the consequences, having Anna in his life has brought him joy. Step 1: Understand the background and context of the event. In this case, Boris Becker, a famous tennis star, had a lovechild with Angela Ermakova during a scandalous affair in 1999. The child, Anna Ermakova, is now 14 years old and recently made her debut at Berlin Fashion Week. Step 2: Acknowledge the significance of the event. Anna Ermakova's debut at Berlin Fashion Week represents a significant milestone in her life, as she is stepping out of her father's shadow and beginning to forge her path. Step 3: Consider the perspectives of the people involved. Boris Becker has admitted that the affair cost him his marriage and disrupted his private life for several years. However, he also expressed happiness about having Anna in his life. Angela Ermakova, as the mother, likely supports her daughter's endeavors at Berlin Fashion Week. Anna herself might feel a sense of accomplishment and independence from her father's fame with her debut. Step 4: Evaluate the impact of this event on the individuals involved and the wider society. For Anna, her debut at Berlin Fashion Week could open up doors to a career in the fashion industry. Her presence at the event also draws attention to the circumstances of her birth, keeping the public discussion alive regarding the scandalous affair between Becker and Ermakova. In wider society, this event highlights the life and career progression of children born to famous parents, especially those with controversial backstories. Step 5: Conclude with an overview and any future implications. Overall, Anna Ermakova's debut at Berlin Fashion Week marks a crucial turning point in her life as she steps out of her father's shadow and embraces a career in the fashion world. The ongoing impacts of her famous parentage and the circumstances of her birth will continue to be a topic of discussion as her career progresses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What are the full names of the people who could not coordinate their schedules? Answer the above question based on the context below: Aaliyah began recording the album in 1998. She recorded a few songs, including two with longtime collaborator Timbaland, before working on Romeo Must Die. In 1999, while working on the record in New York City, Aaliyah called and asked Trent Reznor, one of her musical idols, to produce a song, but they could not coordinate their schedules. She intended to finish the album by the end of 2000 and resumed its recording while filming in Australia for Queen of the Damned (2002), as she shot her part for the film during the day and recorded songs at night. She said in an interview for Billboard, \\"there were nights when I didn't go into the studio—I was too tired. On the weekends, I always made it.\\" Jomo Hankerson, Blackground president and Aaliyah's cousin, said that he had to \\"bribe the producers\\", who did not want to \\"go halfway around the world!\\" He added that they ultimately had \\"a beautiful time ... making hot music\\".Most of the album's songs were recorded at either Sony Studios in New York City or Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne, including \\"Loose Rap\\", which was done at both studios. Aaliyah recorded \\"More Than a Woman\\" at Manhattan Center Studios, \\"U Got Nerve\\" at Soundtracks Studios in New York City, \\"We Need a Resolution\\" at Westlake Studios, and \\"I Care 4 U\\" at Magic Mix Studios and Music Grinder Studios in Los Angeles. She had first recorded \\"I Care 4 U\\", written by past collaborator Missy Elliott, in 1996 for One in a Million, but scrapped it after that album's completion. Aaliyah worked with Blackground Records' in-house crew of musicians, songwriters, and producers, including novice producers Bud'da, J. Dub, Rapture, and Eric Seats.

Write some highlights for the following article: July 1, 2014, the 17th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, is set to be a hot, possibly stormy day. But the suffocating weather won't stop pro-democracy Hong Kongers -- possibly hundreds of thousands of them -- from filling the streets, beginning at 3 p.m today. Activists are openly challenging China's vision for the city's political future, and they believe the public is on their side. In a recent unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy activist group Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP), 787,767 Hong Kongers voted in support of free elections for the city's next leader. READ MORE: Hong Kong's 'referendum' -- What you should know. The almost-800,000 figure represents about 22% of registered voters in Hong Kong, out of a total of 3.5 million registered voters, according to government figures. Before the vote began ten days ago, organizers were hoping around 100,000 people would participate. Benny Tai, a co-organiser of OCLP, said Hong Kongers were \\"using this opportunity to at least show Beijing how determined we are for universal suffrage.\\" Hong Kong's former second-highest-ranked official, Anson Chan, echoed the sentiment in an interview with CNN on Monday. \\"Whatever Beijing says in public now I think it can hardly afford to ignore the voices of 780,000 people.\\" But the Chinese government's reaction was decidedly more frosty, with the government declaring the poll \\"illegal\\" and its results \\"invalid\\" even before the ballots were counted. Rimsky Yuen, Hong Kong's Secretary for Justice, has previously said there is no legal basis for the vote. Yuen, as well a number of other, pro-establishment voices, declined to speak to CNN. A recent Chinese state media editorial said the poll was a \\"farce.\\" Searches for the referendum have also been heavily censored on the Chinese internet. Showdown over democracy. The city's pro-democracy camp wants fully democratic elections for the city's next leader, while China insists it will only allow elections in which it gets to approve the nominees. Specifically, Beijing says it will only allow candidates who \\"love China.\\" The Occupy Central referendum outlined three plans to reform the upcoming election. All three plans proposed that candidates be nominated publicly, regardless of whether the candidates have Beijing's blessing. 42% of participants picked a proposal by the Alliance for True Democracy, which said candidates for Hong Kong's chief executive should be nominated by the public, and conditions such as requiring candidates to \\"love China\\" should not be allowed. Another question asked if Hong Kong's legislature should veto any nomination process that did not meet \\"international standards.\\" This was overwhelmingly approved in the referendum. The high numbers are a sign that Hong Kongers are not about to back down, said Tai. \\"We have an offer and we have a baseline, and this is the thing we will give to the (Hong Kong government),\\" he told CNN. \\"I think a responsible government must respond to that. I cannot see any reason for refusing to meet with us.\\" But if negotiations fail, and no progress is made through legal means, then the group is prepared to disrupt the city to make their statement heard. As a final strategy, Tai says his group may marshal 10,000 people to sit and peacefully block traffic in downtown Hong Kong as a way to pressure Beijing into allowing Hong Kong to exercise \\"genuine universal suffrage.\\" \\"We will only resort to the civil disobedience action as our last resort,\\" said Tai. \\"Only after exhausting all the legal means and still fail to achieve our goals will we resort to civil disobedience.\\" Grassroots support. The city is politicized like at no other time in its recent past. While the July 1st anniversary of the handover has always brought demonstrators out onto Hong Kong's hot, crowded streets, often numbering over 100,000, this year protests are expected to be super-sized. Many Hong Kongers are enraged after the recent publication of a white paper by the Chinese government which declares Beijing's \\"comprehensive jurisdiction\\" over Hong Kong. READ MORE: Alarm in Hong Kong at Chinese white paper affirming Beijing control. Chan said the white paper violates the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle enshrined in Hong Kong's constitutional Basic Law, which lets the city maintain high autonomy despite being a part of China. The white paper \\"makes it quite clear that whatever autonomy we enjoy is for the central government to give and to take away at its pleasure,\\" she said. \\"I think this has caused real concern.\\" The inflammatory document came days after 100,000 people showed up to an annual candlelit vigil for the victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. \\"(The white paper) has spectacularly backfired, it's made people even more angry,\\" Chan said. What's next? The situation in Hong Kong is volatile. Some activists fear a crackdown on freedoms by the Chinese central government, and others look nervously to the possibility of unrest at tomorrow's mass protest. Michael DeGolyer, Director of the Hong Kong Transition Project, an independent organization that monitors governance in the territory, said the future is incredibly difficult to assess because no one is totally sure what China's officials are thinking. \\"We're in a situation where we have a new regime in power and much more volatile circumstances, and we have groups that are much more separatist, challenging the legitimacy of the central government altogether,\\" he said. \\"In these circumstances, it is extremely difficult to tell what the central government intends and what they're thinking and how they'll react.\\" But despite the uncertainty, Hong Kong's democracy supporters remain hopeful. \\"I do not think Beijing has made up its mind on universal suffrage, so let's see what happens in the months ahead,\\" said Chan. \\"The government stance has a little bit softened in the last few days. There's a chance there,\\" said Tai. \\"After (the July 1 protest), we may be able to see whether there's any change in the stance of the Chinese government.\\"","completion":"- On July 1, 2014, Hong Kong marked the 17th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule, with potentially hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy Hong Kongers taking to the streets. - In an unofficial referendum organized by pro-democracy group Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP), 787,767 Hong Kongers voted in support of free elections for the city's next leader. - Hong Kong's democracy supporters want fully democratic elections for the city's next leader; however, China insists it will only allow elections in which it gets to approve the nominees. - If negotiations with the Chinese government fail and no progress is made, OCLP may use civil disobedience as a last resort to achieve their goals. - Many Hong Kongers were angered by the Chinese government's recent publication of a white paper asserting Beijing's \\"comprehensive jurisdiction\\" over Hong Kong, which they see as violating the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle."},{"prompt":"I heard that Kai needed a bedtime story each night before going to sleep.

Article: This will appear next to all of your comments This will NOT appear anywhere on Newser ||||| Weekend Box Office: 'Fantastic Beasts' No. 1 With 75M, Makes Rivals Disappear Ang Lee's 'Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk' and the Miles Teller boxing biopic 'Bleed for This' were both KO'd, while edgy, R-rated teen drama 'The Edge of Seventeen' fared only slightly better; overseas, 'Fantastic Beasts' debuted to 143.3 million for a 218.3 million global launch. Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling can still cast a magic spell at the box office — although not as powerful sans the Boy Who Lived, at least in North America. Warner Bros.' Harry Potter spinoff and prequel Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, from a script by Rowling, topped the weekend domestic box office with 75 million from 4,144 theaters, behind the openings of all eight Harry Potter movies but in line with other high-profile spinoffs, such as the Hobbit trilogy. Overseas was a different matter, at least in numerous territories. Fantastic Beasts bowed to 143.3 million offshore for a global debut of 218.3 million, and it has yet to open in China and Japan. In South Korea (14.3 million) and Russia (9.8 million), it came in ahead of every Harry Potter film, while in the U.K., it earned 18.3 million, behind only the two final installments. Fantastic Beasts, which grabbed an A CinemaScore from U.S. audiences, is a crucial test for Warners and Rowling as they look to further expand the Harry Potter Wizarding World with five new films set decades before the events in Harry Potter and featuring a magical new world populated by adults. Eddie Redmayne stars as Newt Scamander, a collector of magical creatures who travels to 1920s New York, where several of his creatures get out. (He's the author of a textbook later used by Harry Potter and other Hogwarts students.) \\"This was a magical weekend that's the result of inspired storytelling by J.K. and kicks off five new movies,\\" said Warner Bros. domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein. \\"The Harry Potter films were all based on Rowling's books. Here, J.K. taught herself how to write an original screenplay, and she inspired all those many fans around the world and to take this ride with her.\\" In the U.S., Fantastic Beasts — rated PG-13 — played notably older than the final two Harry Potter movies, with 65 percent of the audience over the age of 25, compared to 56 percent and 55 percent for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 1 and Part 2, respectively. At the same time, there was a large concentration of moviegoers in the 25-35 age range, with 55 percent of Friday's audience under the age of 35. (Females made up 55 percent of ticket buyers overall.) Disney and Marvel's Doctor Strange continued to wow as it crossed the 570 million mark globally, and will soon overtake fellow Marvel Cinematic Universe title Iron Man (585 million) after already topping several other MCU installments. However, the post-presidential election bump the box office enjoyed last weekend didn't last, as holdovers saw their usual drops. Doctor Strange, for example, fell 59 percent domestically to 17.7 million to place No. 2. Overseas, the pic took in another sturdy 26 million for a foreign total of 390 million and a global haul of 571.5 million. That includes 103 million in China, where Doctor Strange has exceeded the lifetime totals of superhero titles including Guardians of the Galaxy and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. In North America, Fox and DreamWorks Animation's Trolls followed with 17.5 million to pass the 100 million mark domestically and finish Sunday with a 116.2 million cume in North America and 261.3 million worldwide. Paramount release Arrival placed No. 4 with 11.8 million for a domestic total of 43.4 million. And Universal's Almost Christmas rounded out the top five with 7 million for a domestic tally of 25.4 million. After Fantastic Beasts, the three other new films opening nationwide this weekend fared poorly. STX's edgy, R-rated coming-of-age drama The Edge of Seventeen debuted to 4.8 million for a seventh-place finish. The film, which cost 9 million to make, had hoped to launch in the 10 million range. \\"We were disappointed but we were very financially responsible, so we were able to take a creative risk,\\" said Adam Fogelson, president of STX's Motion Picture Group. Bestowed with glowing reviews and an A- CinemaScore, Edge of Seventeen stars Hailee Steinfeld as an awkward teen dealing with her friend falling for her brother, and was helmed by Kelly Fremon Craig in her directorial debut. It also stars Blake Jenner and Woody Harrelson. Open Road's boxing biopic Bleed for This fared even worse with 2.5 million from 1,459 theaters. The film stars Miles Teller as Vinny Pazienza, a boxer who attempts to make a comeback after a terrible car accident. Ang Lee's Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is the biggest bomb, earning an estimated 1 million from 1,176 theaters for Sony/TriStar after opening last weekend in New York and Los Angeles. That's even worse than last year's The Walk, which opened to 1.5 million from 448 theaters. Sony studio chief Tom Rothman made both titles when running TriStar and before being named chairman of Sony's Motion Picture Group. Lee's modern-day war drama, which cost a net 40 million to produce, was shot with groundbreaking technology that virtually no theater can project without new equipment, so it is playing in a digital format everywhere save for a select few theaters. Billy Lynn grossed 350,000 on Friday. With Hollywood entering the heart of awards season, several high-profile releases debuted in select theaters at the specialty box office this weekend, including Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals, from Focus Features, and Kenneth Lonergan's Manchester by the Sea, from Amazon Studios and Roadside Attractions. Manchester, which launched in four cinemas in New York and Los Angeles, grossed 241,230 for a location average of 60,308, one of the best showings of the year and best ever for Roadside. Nocturnal Animals opted for a larger footprint, opening to 494,000 from 37 locations for a location average of 13,351. Both films hope to serve as strong counterprogramming over Thanksgiving weekend.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why were Europeans excited?\\" Context: \\"By 17 May, the main Austrian army under Charles had arrived on the Marchfeld. Charles kept the bulk of his troops several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On 21 May, the French made their first major effort to cross the Danube, precipitating the Battle of Aspern-Essling. The Austrians enjoyed a comfortable numerical superiority over the French throughout the battle; on the first day, Charles disposed of 110,000 soldiers against only 31,000 commanded by Napoleon. By the second day, reinforcements had boosted French numbers up to 70,000. The battle was characterized by a vicious back-and-forth struggle for the two villages of Aspern and Essling, the focal points of the French bridgehead. By the end of the fighting, the French had lost Aspern but still controlled Essling. A sustained Austrian artillery bombardment eventually convinced Napoleon to withdraw his forces back onto Lobau Island. Both sides inflicted about 23,000 casualties on each other. It was the first defeat Napoleon suffered in a major set-piece battle, and it caused excitement throughout many parts of Europe because it proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Europeans were excited because the Battle of Aspern-Essling marked the first time Napoleon had been defeated in a major set-piece battle. This proved that he could be beaten on the battlefield, which was a significant morale boost for those who opposed his dominance in Europe.

After traveling around the world looking for the right voice, he returns to his hometown of Ohmtown, a remote, storm-ravaged village famous for its unique power plant. Meanwhile, at a nightclub, Omar, Angel, Dizzy and Stretch perform in a small rock band. As Angel performs a gentle love ballad to a mostly empty audience, Mok hears her sing and his special ring goes off, and he realizes that Angel has the voice he needs.

At this time, the computer informs Mok that the only way to stop the demon is with \\"One voice, One heart, One song\\", but when Mok asks who can do this, the computer replies that there is \\"no one\\". Angel and Cindy escape the building and head to the dance club \\"Club 666\\", unaware that Mok's henchmen are following them. Dizzy's aunt bails out Omar and his friends, and tells...
