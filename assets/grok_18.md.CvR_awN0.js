News article: Image caption Many Spanish banks were badly hit when a property investment bubble burst The euro and stock markets have gained in Asia after a deal to shore up Spain's troubled banks eased concerns about a European currency break up. In Asian trade, the euro rose 1% versus the US dollar and Japanese yen. Stock indexes in Japan and Hong Kong rose 2%. On Saturday, Eurozone ministers agreed to lend Spain up to 100bn euros (125bn; £80bn) to help its banks. Analysts said the deal would buy time for policymakers to solve other problems facing the 17-nation eurozone. The biggest issue now looming on the horizon are the 17 June elections in Greece, and the worry that an anti-eurozone party may end up in a position of power. \\"All eyes are still on Greece's upcoming elections but investors' worries over the eurozone have eased in the short term,\\" said Andy Du of Orient Futures Derivatives. According to Stephen Davies of Javelin Wealth Management, the fact that the Spanish banking bailout was bigger than many people had expected pointed to a continuing \\"degree of strain within the European banking system\\". \\"It reflects the fairly dire straits within which Europe continues to find itself,\\" he added. Recession Spain's weakest banks were left with billions of euros of bad loans following the collapse of a property boom and the recession that followed. Currently Spain is in its second recession in three years and the economy is expected to shrink by 1.7% this year. Its economic problems have become so acute, and its borrowing costs in the international markets so high, that there have been concerns that the government would not be able to service its debts. Media caption \\"The Greek election result is going to be critical, not just for Asian markets, but globally,\\" Stephen Davies, Javelin Wealth Management At the same time, there were fears that some of its banks would not be able to find enough capital to continue to operate. The exact amount of emergency funding that Spain will receive will be decided after two audits of its banks are completed within the next few days. Spain's loan was welcomed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as the US and Japan. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy hailed the decision as a victory for the single currency. European Union economic affairs commissioner Olli Rehn said the deal was a clear signal to the markets that the euro area was ready to take decisive action to calm markets and contain contagion. Spain is the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy - twice the size combined of those of Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the countries bailed out so far. Volatility ahead? However, tensions over the euro remain high with another election to be held in Greece next weekend. If voters elect a government that refuses to abide by the terms of the country's bailout deal, Athens faces a possible exit from the bloc. Analysts said that in the days leading up to the election it was likely that a low-risk appetite from investors would return. \\"The Greek election result is going to be critical,\\" said Mr Davies from Javelin Wealth Management. There are fears that a Greek exit could trigger a run on the banks, not only there but in other eurozone countries. Greece has been in recession for five years, crippled by huge debts, high unemployment and labour unrest. ||||| Mobs of angry citizens storming branches, banging saucepans and chanting slogans in noisy protests at the plan to rescue Spain's most stricken banking entity while the population suffers deep austerity measures and struggles against disappearing credit-lines. But as Spaniards woke up today to the news that the EU had given their banks a lifeline of up to €100bn there was optimism that, at last, something had been done to stop the rot. \\"Spain, finally, will be rescued,\\" screamed the frontpage of Spain's leading daily newspaper El Pais . \\"Tragedy for the moment has been averted.\\" Even as pundits struggled to explain the about turn by the government which had insisted even hours before the announcement that no such request would be made, Spain's embattled Prime Minister claimed the agreement as a personal victory. \\"Nobody pressured me and I don't know if I should say this, but it was I who pressured for a line of credit,\\" said Mr Rajoy. Avoiding use of the word \\"rescue\\" he claimed the \\"opening of credit lines\\" from the EU was the best possible solution for Spain's current problems and did not come with any \\"conditionality\\" but that Spain would continue on its path of austerity and structural reforms. While acknowledging that a \\"line of credit\\" had been opened up for Spain's financial system, he accepted that the country's deep economic misery would worsen. \\"This year is going to be a bad one,\\" he said. That warning will only add to the public outrage at the disastrous state of Spain's banking sector which has brought the nation to its knees. Co-ordinated groups have been taking simultaneous action at bank branches in cities across Spain, mobilised by social networks, to find a voice against what many view as the scandal of banking mismanagement. \\"Why should they rescue the banks when our children are starving?\\" screamed one placard outside a Bankia branch in Madrid's Plaza de Celenque during a protest at the weekend. Many protestors have already lost their homes due to foreclosures and complain of the generosity towards the banking system while they are left without aid. Spaniards are slamming the 'impunity' of the bankers as details of pay-offs to former senior executives further enrage those struggling to pay their bills and suffering deep cuts in public spending. Many hold the view that those responsible for mismanaging the stricken banks and hiding the extent of problems for so long should be investigated alongside any injection of capital. \\"It's time to call these people to account. One year ago they insisted Bankia was a sound institution and told workers to invest. Now these people have lost 40 per cent of their savings,\\" said Pedro Videla, economics professor at Madrid's IESE business school, who argued that if there is to be any restoration of faith in the sector then: \\"Those responsible need to go to jail.\\" An opinion poll published on Sunday showed that 78 per cent of Spaniards had \\"little or no\\" confidence in Mr Rajoy or his governing Popular Party. \\"How can we trust anything this government says?\\" said Francisco Silvente as he walked his dogs down a quiet Madrid street yesterday morning. \\"This is not a rescue for Spain, it's a rescue for the rich. The poor will only get poorer and suffer even more in the months to come.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"This news article talks about how money and help from other countries, especially from Eurozone members, were given to Spain to help their troubled banks.

I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment. We all say stupid shit sometimes; just laugh at yourself and enjoy the silly moment. Who made the personal critique to the girl?

The South Bend mayor becomes the first openly gay executive in the state, and the highest elected official in Indiana to come out ||||| Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has a profound message for his neighbors and constituents. The 33-year-old Democrat and Afghanistan war veteran, once described as the \\"most interesting mayor you’ve never heard of,\\" came out as gay in an op-ed on Tuesday. See also: Why bathrooms are the next frontier in transgender acceptance \\"I was well into adulthood before I was prepared to acknowledge the simple fact that I am gay,\\" he wrote in the South Bend Tribune. \\"It took years of struggle and growth for me to recognize that it’s just a fact of life, like having brown hair, and part of who I am.\\" Buttigieg's coming out arrives in the wake of a controversial state \\"religious freedom\\" law that critics said would allow discrimination against lesbian, gay and transgender people. He minced no words when it came to that legislation, calling it \\"disastrous\\" and arguing that the fallout should be an \\"opportunity to demonstrate how a traditional, religious state like ours can move forward.\\" \\"If different sides steer clear of name-calling and fear-mongering, we can navigate these issues based on what is best about Indiana: values like respect, decency, and support for families — all families,\\" he wrote. Buttigieg spoke to people who may not feel comfortable living publicly as a gay person in a conservative city or state — and those who might be wary of changing social norms. Putting something this personal on the pages of a newspaper does not come easy. We Midwesterners are instinctively private to begin with, and I’m not used to viewing this as anyone else’s business. But it’s clear to me that at a moment like this, being more open about it could do some good. For a local student struggling with her sexuality, it might be helpful for an openly gay mayor to send the message that her community will always have a place for her. And for a conservative resident from a different generation, whose unease with social change is partly rooted in the impression that he doesn’t know anyone gay, perhaps a familiar face can be a reminder that we’re all in this together as a community. The op-ed clearly touched people in Buttigieg's hometown and around the world; the piece had 25,000 likes several hours after being published, and it received supportive comments from people who identified themselves as residents of South Bend. In the end, Buttigieg's plea was simple: \\"Like most people, I would like to get married one day and eventually raise a family,\\" he wrote. \\"I hope that when my children are old enough to understand politics, they will be puzzled that someone like me revealing he is gay was ever considered to be newsworthy.\\" ||||| Close Get email notifications on Erin Blasko daily!

Group P studied more about predatory protozoa, while group G studied about grazing and parasitic protozoa, plus portozoa as food sources. Which group learned more about protozoa keeping bacterial populations in check? Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host.

The bad man went inside the restaurant at about the time when most people have a snack, around 4 in the afternoon. There were other people living in tall buildings nearby, and they couldn't leave their homes because the police needed to make sure everyone was safe. That's what the brave officers from the South Wales Police did, they made sure everyone stayed in their homes until they could stop the bad man. The police officers had to be very smart and strong, and they used a special tool called a \\"taser\\" to stop the bad man. A taser is something that can help the police gently stop someone who is being very dangerous, without hurting them too much. For two hours, the officers tried to talk to the bad man and tried to rescue the person he was holding. They worked very hard to make sure everything would be ok.

If you like Star Wars/Trek, come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices. It's my top 2 favorite movies of all times, other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's \\"The Tempest\\") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up. This was the first movie where you COULDN'T. Miracle it was made at \\"A-movie\\" scale, economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it. And director Wilcox's previous 'hit' was \\"Lassie Come Home\\". Until I looked him up, I assumed 'Fred Wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a \\"B\\" genre back then. This was either a very VERY visionary production, or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll Hollywood. There are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that Lucas used extensively. There are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; \\"computers\\", as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. Star Trek's 'transporter' is there, visually, almost unaltered by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the Trek/Wars technobabble turns you off, FP's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate, even today. The \\"ship\\" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything 'Trek' has done, for TV or film. We didn't get to spend as much time there as I would have liked. If you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently, watching FP will explain all that.

Explanation: The context of the passage indicates that David Moyes, referred to also as \\"Moyes,\\" was having a difficult time. Thus, the sentence \\"Not for the first time this season, Moyes/David Moyes looked like a team of impostors\\" is the most fitting continuation. It metaphorically conveys the struggles he was experiencing. Incorrect Options: - Matt Lawton, Matt_Lawton_DM: These refer to the author of the article, not a relevant subject in the context. - Everton, Goodison Park: Goodison Park is a venue, not a person. Everton is a football club and was not indicated to be having a problem. - Klopp, L, Roberto Martinez, Martinez, Simeone, Van Gaal: These individuals are not the main subject of the discussion in the paragraph. - Scot: This is a nationality and not a person within the context of the passage. - United: This may refer to Manchester United, a football team, but there is no context suggesting the team was performing poorly as a whole.

Article: It’s tempting to just get the offending pus out of your skin, but you should leave pimple popping to medical experts using professional tools. When you pop a pimple, the bacteria that oozes out can get into the pores in the surrounding skin, actually spreading acne to otherwise healthy skin. You might also cause more bleeding, which is never a good thing! A pimple should run its course within three to seven days, so just medicate it with topical treatments and wait it out. Think about it this way: you probably want to get rid of the zit because you don't like the way it looks. But a zit is temporary. Popping it can cause scarring — and you probably won't like the way that looks, either, but the difference is the scarring is permanent. It's better to just wait out the pimple and allow it to clear up rather than risk permanently marring your skin. Most acne treatments on the market make use of it, so you can find it in a wide variety of styles. Depending on your preference, you can use benzoyl peroxide as a lotion, gel, cleanser, cream, or face wash. It kills off the bacteria that causes acne outbreaks and removes excess oil and dead skin cells from the surface of the skin. Be careful not to get it on your clothing, as it can discolor dyed cloth. The products on the market that contain salicylic acid come in a wide variety of strengths, so look at the packaging to determine which product will be best for you. Like benzoyl peroxide, it comes in a variety of application styles: medicated wipes or pads, creams, gels, cleansers and face washes, and even shampoos. Salicylic acid can cause skin irritation when you first start using it, so apply a small amount for a few days. You can gradually increase your usage as your skin adjusts to the product. These products tend to dry out the skin. Make sure you moisturize regularly, and decrease your usage if the dryness gets out of hand. Don’t use products with salicylic acid if you have any open or broken pimples on your face. This is a topical cream that must be prescribed by your doctor or dermatologist. Wash your hands before and after applying Retin-A, then wash your face with a gentle cleanser. Wait about 20 to 30 minutes, then apply the cream — if your skin is not try, the Retin-A may irritate it. Apply a thin layer to the acne lesions before bedtime or in the evening. Avoid the eyes, ears, and mouth. Retin-A can make your skin sensitive to sunlight, so make sure you limit exposure and wear sunscreen and protective clothing if you go outside. Never apply to sunburned skin. Consult your doctor if you are planning on getting pregnant. Many people mistakenly think that scrubbing at their skin will help clean and treat the skin more quickly. In fact, vigorous scrubbing usually makes acne worse. It irritates the skin, and can weaken its natural defenses against bacteria and infection. Choose a gentle cleanser like Cetaphil or Noxzema. These soaps will help keep the skin moist and clean. The best way to massage to soap into the skin for cleaning is with you hands and fingers. Make sure you wash your hands before applying the soap. If a product tells you to use it twice daily, don’t assume that using it four times a day will be twice as effective. In fact, the opposite might be true: by upsetting the balance of your skin, you can cause redness, dryness, and irritation that keeps your skin unhealthy and uncomfortable. Don’t give up on treatment too quickly! Many treatments take a long time to have a positive effect on unhealthy skin, so follow the instructions and be patient. Experts recommend waiting at least six to12 weeks before deciding a treatment doesn’t work for you. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of this article would be: Popping pimples can cause more harm to your skin, so it's better to let them heal on their own.

Q:Given the following context: One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist. One day Mist gets giddy and runs off into the woods; a dark place where she soon gets lost and has to be rescued by the Boss and Sir Gregory. This amuses Fern. answer the following question: Which puppy runs into the forest and needs rescued? A:","completion":"Mist is the puppy that runs into the forest and needs to be rescued.

Write some highlights for the following article: Leading liberal Senator Bernie Sanders has admitted he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016 in a move that could complicate Hilary Clinton's long-expected run at the White House. Mr Sanders, an independent from Vermont, could pose a challenge from the left to Clinton - widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, despite not yet declaring her candidacy. Speaking to NBC's 'Meet the Press' show on Sunday, Mr Sanders said he will be using the key battleground state of Iowa to help him test whether there is an appetite for a liberal but independent candidate. If running as a Democrat gave him a better chance of success however, he would challenge Mrs Clinton. Scroll down for video. Liberal Senator Bernie Sanders (right) has confirmed he is considering running for U.S. president in 2016 in a move that could complicate Hilary Clinton's (left) long-expected run at the White House. Mr Sanders, 73, is currently serving his second six-year term in the Senate. He has cultivated a following among some American liberals,. especially on economic issues like the growing income disparity. between rich and poor and corporate greed. He is a. self-described socialist who caucuses with Democrats in the. Senate. 'I am thinking about running for president,' Mr Sanders said. 'I think anybody who speaks to the needs of the working class and the middle class of this country and shows the courage to take on the billionaire class, I think that candidate will do pretty well,' he added. Socialist: Bernie Sanders has cultivated a following among some American liberals - especially on economic issues like the growing income disparity between rich and poor and corporate greed. Mr Sanders denied he was considering standing in order to hamper Mrs Clinton's campaign, saying he has 'a lot of respect' for her, adding 'the issue is not Hillary.' Mr Sanders is testing the waters in Iowa, a state that holds an. important early contest in the nomination process. 'One of the reasons I'm going to Iowa is to get a sense of. how people feel about it,' he said of his candidacy. 'Look, the. truth is [there is] profound anger at both political parties,. more and more people are becoming independent. The negative is:. how do you set up a 50-state infrastructure as an independent?' Relaxed: Hillary Clinton (pictured alongside her husband former U.S. President Bill Clinton) is widely seen as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, despite not yet formally declaring her candidacy. With Mrs Clinton mindful of the need to appeal to moderates in. any general election battle against a Republican in 2016, a. Sanders candidacy could force her to the left in the Democratic. primaries to head off his challenge. Conversely, if he runs in the general election as an. independent, he could siphon away from her votes from liberals. that she could need to beat any Republican nominee. American liberals have expressed disappointment with. President Barack Obama on a range of issues, most recently on. his decision to postpone any executive action on immigration. This comes even as Republican leaders in the House of Representatives block. action on a bipartisan Senate-passed plan. Mr Sanders said that he has 'a lot of disagreements' with. Obama, adding: 'I think he has not tapped the anger and the. frustration that the American people feel on many, many issues.' Bernie Sanders, 73, is the longest serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, having been elected to Vermont's at-large congressional district in 1990. Born into a family of Polish Jewish immigrants in New York in 1941, he was involved in student activism before entering politics with the anti-Vietnam War Liberty Union Party in Vermont. In 1981, at the suggestion of his friend Richard Sugarman, a professor of religion at the University of Vermont, Sanders ran for Mayor of Burlington and defeated six-term Democratic incumbent Gordon Paquette by 14 votes in a four-way contest. Sanders won three more terms, defeating both Democratic and Republican candidates. In his final run for Mayor in 1987, Sanders defeated a candidate endorsed by both major parties. Veteran: 73-year-old Bernie Sanders is the longest serving independent in U.S. Congressional history, having been elected to Vermont's at-large congressional district in 1990. He temporarily retired from politics in 1989, teaching political science at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government in 1989 while making an unsuccessful run at Vermont's at-large congressional district. Sanders was elected at his second attempt, defeating Republican incumbent Lieutenant Governor Peter Smith to become the first independent in Congress for 40 years. In 1991, Sanders co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and chaired the grouping of mostly liberal Democrats. He continues to caucus with the Democratic Party and is counted as a Democrat for purposes of committee assignments. During his time in Congress, Sanders built a reputation for progressive Liberalism proposing a number of radical socialist policies, voting against the use of force in both Iraq wars, and becoming an outspoken critic of the administration of George W Bush in the 2000s. Republicans have attacked Sanders as 'an ineffective extremist' for successfully sponsoring only one law and 15 amendments in his eight terms in the House. Sanders responded by saying that he had passed 'the most floor amendments of any member of the House since 1996'. In 2006 Sanders was elected to the U.S. Senate in the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history. He was reelected in 2012 with 71 per cent of the vote. Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, and has repeatedly praised Scandinavian-style social democracy. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Step 2: Research the recent and historical issues in each category for Norway. Step 3: Analyze the findings and determine which problems are considered the most serious or pressing in each category. Step 4: Summarize the significant problems in each category. Some serious problems concerning Norway include: - High costs of living, making it difficult for people with lower incomes to afford essential goods and services. - Dependency on the oil industry, which contributes to a significant portion of Norway's GDP and raises concerns about environmental sustainability and economic diversification. - Aging population, leading to potential challenges in healthcare, pensions, and workforce availability. - Rural depopulation, with young people moving to urban areas for better opportunities, leaving smaller communities vulnerable. 2. Why some people consider Norway boring: Some reasons why people might consider Norway boring include: - Comparatively smaller population, resulting in fewer big cities and a lower-density social environment. - A relatively homogeneous culture and limited cultural diversity compared to some other countries. - The cold climate and long winters, which may limit social and outdoor activities. - Limited nightlife options and fewer entertainment venues in smaller cities and towns.

Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes. The mask doesn’t dry completely, it stays a little bit tacky to the touch, and I find that it makes my skin tingle quite a bit. For extra benefits you can also then massage the mask into your skin for around 2 minutes, before removing with a damp muslin cloth or flannel.

A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Slaters of Wolverhampton are plagued with Mrs. Slater's chronic debilitating asthma and her cooking limited to what comes in canned goods that she can heat in boiling water. Mr. Alan Slater is sick with worry and has a cantankerous personality. Nigel longs for a life that is more than a succession of canned-food dinners made from what can be heated in boiling water. When dinner is burnt, the standard substitute of toast is always served. He loves toast, with the crunchy outside giving way to buttery softness inside. Despite her infrequent forays into cooking meals from scratch, his mother's attempts to improve her cooking change nothing before or after her death. His father continues in widowhood with the same cooking style and frequent dinners of toast. The experience brings Nigel to conclude that he is not liked. Nigel learns from a friend that the way in which he could attempt a better relationship with his father is to cook a meal for him. His cooking efforts are thwarted by the new housekeeper, the married and \\"common\\" Mrs. Joan Potter, who seduces Alan with her apple pie and array of gourmet meals. The two start to spend time together: at one point, she exiting her council house through an upstairs window so as not to be found out by her husband. Without announcement, the Slaters move to the Herefordshire countryside along with Mrs. Potter. Nigel co-exists with her but never accepts her. She makes a competition of cooking when the teenaged Nigel's shows an emerging interest in developing his skills at school home economics class cookery lessons. Mrs. Potter's lemon meringue pie becomes Nigel's quest to learn the secret recipe. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Nigel Slater, a young member of the Slater family from Wolverhampton, loves toast. Amidst Mrs. Slater's chronic asthma and limited cooking abilities due to her condition, the family often consumes canned-food dinners, prepared by heating the contents in boiling water. Often, the dinner would end up burnt, and toast would be served as a substitute. Nigel finds solace in the crunchy texture outside and the buttery softness inside of toast, despite the repetitive and rather uninspiring meals. Following his mother's death, Nigel's life remains unchanged as his father, Alan Slater, continues with the same boiling water cooking style, leading to frequent toast dinners. This monotonous pattern of meals leads Nigel to feel unliked and prompts him to seek a better relationship with his father through the shared experience of cooking a meal together. Unfortunately, Nigel's efforts are hampered by the new housekeeper, Mrs. Joan Potter, who entices Alan with her impressive culinary skills, including a delicious apple pie. As the Slater family moves to the Herefordshire countryside along with Mrs. Potter, Nigel's interest in cooking grows, fueled by his classes in school, where he takes home economics and cookery lessons. In the midst of a continuous competition with Mrs. Potter, Nigel embarks on a quest to learn her secret lemon meringue pie recipe. Despite the challenging circumstances and unchanging food situation at home, Nigel's love for toast remains unwavering, highlighting his appreciation for this simple yet comforting dish."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Think about your reasons for wanting to talk to your ex, and be sure that it is only because you want to pursue a friendship. Be confident that your ex is the kind of person you want to be friends with, too. Think about what kind of friendship you want with your ex. Do you want to be able to hang out together, just the two of you, or do you want to be able to be friendly with your ex in a group of mutual friends? Or do you just want to feel comfortable saying hello to them and liking their pictures on social media? Think about how your ex treated their other friends and make sure they are a good friend to others. For example, if you always thought your ex used friends for their own gains, it's probably not worth it to develop a friendship. More importantly, think about how your ex treated you. There's a reason you and your ex split. If it was because they didn't treat you well, then it's best to leave them in the past. You may want to run this idea by friends and family members who know your ex. They may be able to provide some insight and help you decide if it's a good idea to pursue a friendship. When you are preparing to talk to your ex, make sure you think about how you want to clearly communicate your desire for a friendship. You do not want let your ex think you are interested in anything more. For example, think about saying something like, “I have missed being in touch with you and have been remembering how much fun we had together as friends. I hope we could be friends again, though I want to be clear that a friendship is all that I want.” If you are nervous about your ex's reaction, you might feel better about getting in touch with them via email or letter. Writing a letter lets you spend as much time as you need getting your words just the way you want them, and you can also say everything you need to say without worrying about being interrupted or argued with. You could begin your letter, “I am sure you are surprised to be hearing from me. I know we parted on bad terms, and I apologize for that. I have been thinking lately about how much our friendship meant to me, and how much I miss it. I am hoping we can reconnect as friends.” Keep in mind that you may need to be patient about hearing back from your ex. It may take them a few days to compose a letter in response. They could also decide to call or text you if you indicate they can in your letter. Your ex may also not respond to you. If they do not, you may need to decide whether or not to let it go, or try to get in touch with them in a different way. If you still have your ex's number, it might be easiest to give them a call. Your ex will probably be wondering why you are calling, so you may want to be ready to let them know you are looking to reconnect with them shortly into the conversation. You might want to spend some time thinking about what you want to say beforehand. For example, you could say, “I have been thinking about you recently, and I really miss our friendship. I was hoping we could get together sometime and catch up, and maybe try to be friends again.” Your ex may not want to answer your call, so be prepared to leave a voicemail. Practice what you want to say beforehand. You could say something like, “Hi Mina, it's Heather. I know seeing my phone number was probably unexpected, and I don't blame you for not picking up. But I was calling to see how you are and was hoping we could talk sometime. I miss having you in my life as a friend and was hoping you'd be open to being friends again. Please call me back sometime.” Don't call when you've been drinking. Don't make them think this is a drunk-dial situation, because they will not take your request for friendship seriously. If you are still friends with your ex on your social media accounts, try private messaging them through the platform they use the most. Keep your conversation friendly and see if they would like to catch up in person. You could post a message publicly, but keep it short and generic. Don't rehash your relationship where other people can read your conversation. You could say something like, “Hey Chris! I hope you are doing well!” If your ex responds, you could switch to a private message to continue your conversation. Don't show up at their school or work and ask to be friends out of nowhere, for example. That will scare them off. Reach out through other channels first, to give your ex a chance to think about how they would like to respond. If you happen to bump into them by chance, you could say, “Wow, it's good to see you! I would love to catch up sometime if you're open to it. Could I text you sometime?” Avoid a major conversation before they have the chance to consider if they'd like to have you back in their life. if necessary. If you and your ex parted ways poorly, and you played a role in the bad ending, be sure to apologize early on for your part in the breakup. It may be difficult to have a meaningful friendship without an acknowledgement of your wrongdoing. You could say, “I know we had a really bad ending, and I am so sorry for how we parted ways. I hope we can get past it and eventually be friends again. It would be nice to talk about it in person, if you're willing.” Follow up with a more in-depth apology and conversation when you see your ex. They may not want to reconnect with you, and they may or may not provide you with reasons why they don't want to. Accept their choice with understanding and without demanding an explanation. Keep in mind that they may not respond to any forms of communication. Your ex may be comfortable talking to you online, for example, but may not be interested in seeing you in person. Accept that and work to rekindle your friendship through the boundaries your ex sets. Keep the door open for a potential face-to-face meeting in the future. If your ex responds with a message that conveys they are not interested in talking to you, you could say, “I'm sorry to hear that, but I understand.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Where would there be a ticket office that has people with suitcases? - hotel - train station - opera house - end of line - city The best answer is","completion":"the train station. A train station is where people often carry suitages because they are traveling either locally or internationally. A ticket office is necessary at a train station because it's where commuters purchase tickets for their respective journeys. It's normal that those who are going to travel or those who have just arrived are seen with their luggage. At a train station you'd find various types of ticket offices. There could be self-service ticket machines where you can purchase tickets yourself without any assistance. There are also manned ticket offices, where staff are available to help you with your purchase and answer any questions or clarify any issues you may have regarding your travel. It's best to arrive at the station well in advance of your train's departure time to allow time to purchase your ticket, particularly during peak traveling times when there may be long lines at the ticket office. A hotel, although often frequented by people with suitcases, likely doesn't have a ticket office because their main business isn't transport. Instead of a ticket office, a hotel will usually have a reception or front desk where guests check in and check out. An opera house, similar to a hotel, would not typically have a ticket office for travel. Instead, any box offices present in an opera house would be selling tickets to the performances being held there. The term \\"end of line\\" often refers to the last station on a transit line, and while there may be a ticket office and people with suitcases there, it's not as universally applicable as a train station. The term \\"city\\" is just too broad. In a city, you would find all sorts of facilities including train stations, hotels, and opera houses, so it's not specific enough to be the best answer. So, when thinking of a place where a ticket office and people with suitages are most commonly found together, a train station is the most logical and universal answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the man on the science team that had Antarctic experience? is inside the article: Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \\"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition. The only scientist with previous Antarctic experience was Louis Bernacchi, who had been with Borchgrevink as magnetic observer and meteorologist. The geologist, Hartley Ferrar, was a 22-year-old recent Cambridge graduate who Markham thought \\"might be made into a man.\\" Marine biologist Thomas Vere Hodgson, from Plymouth Museum, was a more mature figure, as was the senior of the two doctors, Reginald Koettlitz, who, at 39, was the oldest member of the expedition.

So, he is the man with Antarctic experience on the science team being referred to in the question. This sentence provides us with a direct answer to the question, based on the details given in the extract of the article.

Paragraph: Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

Question: What description was not used to describe Mary: accursed or holy? Context: It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What country backed the Karposh's Rebellion in 1689?, using the article: The Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right. Sultan Murad I took Adrianople from the Byzantines in 1362; Sofia fell in 1382, followed by Shumen in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689.

Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"What country backed the Karposh's Rebellion in 1689?\\" based on the given article is Habsburg Austria. The article mentions that Habsburg Austria backed several uprisings in Bulgaria, including the uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688, and finally, Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. These uprisings were part of Habsburg Austria's efforts to weaken the Ottoman Empire's hold on the region, as well as to help the Bulgarian Christians who had been subjected to heavy taxes, suppression of their culture, and partial Islamisation under Ottoman rule. Furthermore, the Russian Empire also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands, and the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774 further solidified this role. However, it is Habsburg Austria that directly supported and backed the Karposh's Rebellion in 1689."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here are possible answers to this question: - carton - light fire - burn down forest - ashtray - hand I believe the correct choice is \\"carton\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"carton.\\" Here's why: A cigarette carton is specifically designed to maintain the freshness and quality of cigarettes. It does so by protecting the cigarettes from various factors that can cause their deterioration, such as light, air, and moisture. The carton provides a sealed environment that minimizes the exposure of the cigarettes to these factors, thereby keeping them fresh for an extended period. Let's examine the other choices and why they are not the correct answer: - Light fire: Lighting a cigarette does not keep it fresh; instead, it initiates the burning process, during which the cigarette releases smoke and produces ash, thus leading to its consumption. - Burn down forest: This option has no relevance to the freshness of a cigarette. Burning a forest can lead to severe environmental consequences and is not related to maintaining the freshness of a cigarette in any way. - Ashtray: An ashtray is a receptacle used to collect the ash and extinguish the butts of cigarettes after they have been smoked. While useful for managing the waste produced by smoking cigarettes, an ashtray does not contribute to keeping cigarettes fresh. - Hand: Holding a cigarette in hand does not maintain its freshness either. Furthermore, prolonged exposure of the cigarette to air and moisture present in the environment can cause the cigarette to dry out, losing its freshness and decreasing its quality. In conclusion, the correct choice for keeping a cigarette fresh is a carton, as it provides a sealed environment that protects cigarettes from various factors that could compromise their freshness and quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? the shit seems to have hit the fan.","completion":"In order to assess the syntactic and semantic acceptability of the sentence \\"the shit seems to have hit the fan,\\" we must first review the components of syntactic and semantic acceptability separately. Syntactic acceptability refers to the conformity of a sentence to the rules and structure of a language's grammar. The sentence in question follows the basic structure of the English language, as it contains a subject (the shit), a linking verb (seems), a helping verb (to have), a main verb in past participle form (hit), and an object (the fan). Moreover, it follows the standard word order of subject-verb-object (SVO) that is common in English. Therefore, from a syntactic standpoint, the sentence is acceptable. However, this sentence exemplifies the use of colloquial language and informal speech since it employs the use of an idiomatic expression. The expression \\"the shit hits the fan\\" is considered informal and even vulgar due to its use of the profanity \\"shit.\\" In the given sentence, this idiom appears in a modified version to indicate a past or present event (\\"the shit seems to have hit the fan\\"). While this modification retains the informal and colloquial nature of the phrase, it still adheres to the syntactic structure of the English language. Moving on to semantic acceptability, which concerns the meaning and the relation of elements within a sentence, we can analyze the sentence in its literal and figurative sense. Literally, the phrase describes feces impacting the blades of a fan, which would result in a highly unusual and undesirable situation. This interpretation of the phrase, therefore, might be deemed semantically odd or nonsensical. However, the phrase \\"the shit hits the fan\\" is widely recognized as an idiom meaning that a difficult situation has suddenly arisen, often resulting in negative consequences or chaos. This figurative interpretation is context-dependent, meaning its acceptability depends on the context in which it is used. When interpreted in this idiomatic sense, the sentence is semantically acceptable, conveying the idea that a problematic situation has occurred or been exposed. In conclusion, the sentence \\"the shit seems to have hit the fan\\" is syntactically acceptable, as it follows the sentence structure and grammar rules of the English language. While the sentence is unusual when interpreted literally, it is semantically acceptable when understood as a figurative expression commonly used in informal speech to describe a troublesome situation. Nevertheless, it is essential to note the colloquial and informal nature of this expression, making it unsuitable for use in formal settings or communications."},{"prompt":"Given the question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Widget don't update\\" The answer is:","completion":"★"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

For much of the world, the Algarve is synonymous with Portugal, yet the Portuguese will tell you the exact opposite: the region has little in common with the rest of the country. The southern stretch of coast is more reminiscent of a North African landscape than a European one. It has no cosmopolitan cities, like Lisbon and Porto, which are farther north. Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters. With about 160 km (100 miles) of coastline, Portugal's southern province is one of Europe's premier beach destinations. The occasionally chilly ocean is the Atlantic, but the Algarve has a sultry Mediterranean feel. Its consistent climate is the best in Portugal, and one of the kindest in the world: more than 250 days of sunshine a year — more than almost any other international resort area. The moderating effect of the Gulf Stream produces a fresh springtime breeze throughout winter, and in late January and February, white almond blossoms blanket the fields. In summer the heat is intense but rarely unbearable, and regardless, beautiful beaches and innumerable pools are always just a dive away. Magnificent year-round weather has made the Algarve a huge destination for sporting vacations. Superb golf facilities abound — several with tees dramatically clinging to cliffs and fairways just skirting the edge of the ocean — and horseback riding, tennis, big-game fishing, sailing, and windsurfing are immensely popular. Sports, beaches and hospitable weather — not to mention easily organized package vacations — are surely the reasons the Algarve receives as many visitors as the rest of Portugal in its entirety. But it's not just international tourists that descend on the Algarve; many Portuguese from Lisbon and elsewhere in the north have holiday homes and spend their summer vacations here. The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east. West is where you'll find the famous orange cliffs and surreal eroded rock stacks.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Islamic State claims responsibility for machete attack on Belgian police officers Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a machete attack that wounded two police officers in the Belgian city of Charleroi, calling it an act of reprisal carried out by one of its “soldiers”. Belgian prosecutors identified the assailant as a 33-year-old Algerian known to police for criminal offences, but not for extremism. The attack on Saturday afternoon is being treated as a terrorist incident, notably because the man shouted “Allahu akbar” – Arabic for “God is great” – as he slashed at the officers outside Charleroi’s main police station, prime minister Charles Michel said. The assailant, who was shot by a third officer, died in hospital. A statement by the Islamic State-affiliated Aamaq news agency, posted on Sunday on an Isis-linked Twitter account, said the attack on the officers was in response to the “crusader coalition’s” military campaign against Islamic State and its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Related: Assailant dies after machete attack on Belgian police officers Belgium is a member of the US-led coalition fighting Islamic State, and has supplied warplanes for anti-Isis operations. The Belgian federal prosecutor’s office said the attacker, identified only as KB, had lived in Belgium since 2012. “Since there are indications that the attack may have been inspired by a terrorist motive, the federal prosecutor’s office decided to take over the investigation from the district prosecutor’s office of Charleroi,” the office said in a statement. Two police searches were carried out overnight in the southern Belgian city, but no further information about the investigation would be made public, it added. Both police officers were “severely injured in the face and neck”, the federal prosecutors’ statement said. Michel said an investigation had begun into what a case of “attempted terrorist murder”. The prime minister spoke to reporters following an emergency meeting with top Belgian law enforcement officials Sunday morning. Michel cut short his vacation in the south of France to hurry back to Brussels following the Charleroi attack, which had some police unions clamoring for greater protection for police officers and installations. “We must keep a cool head,” Michel said. “We must avoid panic, of course – not give in to terror. That’s the trap that has been set for us.” Belgium has been on high alert since the suicide bombings in March, claimed by Isis extremists, that killed 32 people in Brussels. Many of the perpetrators of the attacks in Paris in November that killed 130 people were also residents of Belgium. That attack was also claimed by Islamic State. “We know we must be constantly, constantly vigilant,” Michel said. Steven Vandeput, defence minister, said the government’s crisis centre would meet to determine if additional measures should be taken to protect police buildings and staff. On Sunday, Charleroi police posted a request on their Twitter account asking reporters not to divulge officers’ identities. “We are targets,” Charleroi police explained. Prosecutors said KB was carrying a backpack at the time of the attack, but that a bomb squad search found no explosives or other weapons inside. On 27 June, Belgium deployed six F-16s to the Middle East for a year as part of the US-led coalition, with orders to strike Islamic State targets while operating in Syrian and Iraqi airspace, the Belgian defence ministry said at the time. Until returning home in July 2015, Belgium F-16s took part in earlier anti-IS missions over Iraq.","completion":"The Islamic State has said that it was responsible for a machete attack on two Belgian police officers in Charleroi, calling it an \\"act of reprisal\\" by one of its “soldiers”.

The word \\"attendu\\" translates to \\"whereas\\" in English. In legal documents, the term \\"whereas\\" is commonly used to present background information or establish certain facts that lead up to the main points of an agreement or argument. The phrase \\"aux termes de la licence\\" means \\"under the terms of the license\\" and refers to the various provisions, requirements, and specifications detailed in the license document. Licenses are often issued by governing bodies or institutions to grant permission to individuals or entities to carry out particular activities, typically within specific conditions and constraints. The license number (no. 900248) clarifies which specific document the sentence is referring to. It may be a unique identifier, ensuring that the terms being referenced are clear and precise. License numbers also help with record-keeping and tracking any changes or revocations if necessary. Lastly, \\"Direct Air, Inc.\\" is presumably the name of a company. As the subject of the sentence and the entity bound by the terms of the discussed license, the company must follow the stated requirements and specifications to maintain compliance with the governing body or institution that has issued the license. Therefore, the French sentence illustrates the significance of license no. 900248 in relation to the operations and responsibilities of Direct Air, Inc."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Scroll down for video Mimic: A fan ambitiously crafted a new Star Wars trailer shot-for-shot on YouTube using only Lego pieces. Pictured, new cast member John Boyega races across a desert landscape in the role of a Stormtrooper. This passionate fan and YouTuber embarked on this massive project with a keen eye for detail. They started by watching the original trailer several times to grasp every shot and angle. After understanding the scenes thoroughly, they began to gather the necessary Lego pieces to recreate the sets, vehicles, and characters from the Star Wars universe. Next, they assembled the sets one by one, positioning Lego figures in the exact ways portrayed in the trailer. This required a lot of patience and a steady hand, as intricate details needed to be addressed to make the Lego version as faithful to the original as possible. Lighting and camera angles also played a significant role in this recreation process. They carefully studied the lighting in each shot, adjusted the Lego landscapes, and positioned the camera to capture an authentic feel. Once all of the footage was captured, the YouTuber employed their self-taught video editing skills to splice the shots together, replicating the trailer's flow and feel. The result of this labor-intensive process was a remarkably accurate Lego recreation of the Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens trailer, garnering praise and attention from viewers across the globe. This fan's dedication to their craft perfectly demonstrates the power of passion and creativity combined with a love for the iconic Star Wars universe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person that the former child psychiatrist befriends? , can you please find it? Tim Warden, a boy with autism, has supposedly witnessed his parents' double murder. Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him. That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him. Tim mimics the police chief's voice over the phone to lure Sylvie to the police station and pulls Jake out of the lake while she is away.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Agricultural employers have consistently asserted that many U.S. workers did not want to work in seasonal agriculture or live in rural areas, and that crops would rot in the fields without foreign workers. Does it follow that \\"Agricultural employers stated that crops would rot without foreign workers. \\"?","completion":"Yes, it can be concluded that \\"Agricultural employers stated that crops would rot without foreign workers.\\" The statement is derived from the information provided about the concerns and assertions made by agricultural employers regarding the role of foreign workers in the agricultural sector. These concerns mainly focus on two central points: the unwillingness of U.S. workers to work in seasonal agriculture and their preference not to live in rural areas. Based on these points, agricultural employers believe that foreign workers play an indispensable role in the maintenance and productivity of their farms. The potential consequences of not hiring foreign workers, as implied by these employers, would be the inability to find sufficient workforce locally, and this would directly impact the harvesting of crops. If the needed workforce is not available, there is a higher likelihood that the crops will not be harvested on time, leading to their eventual rotting and a drop in agricultural output. This result would be detrimental to the agricultural employers themselves, as well as the national economy and food supply in general. In this context, the assertion that \\"crops would rot without foreign workers\\" is an expression of the clear concern that arises from the perceived lack of interest from local U.S. workers in agricultural work. It highlights the crucial role of foreign laborers in meeting the demand for seasonal agricultural work which ensures the continuous production of fruits and vegetables and other agricultural products. Therefore, it is accurate to infer that agricultural employers stated that crops would rot without foreign workers, as they recognize and depend on the role of these workers in fulfilling the labor demands of seasonal agriculture and maintaining the success and productivity of the agricultural industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Modern plants that live in water are called aquatic plants . Living in water has certain advantages for plants. One advantage is, well, the water. There's plenty of it and it's all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticle on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water.

Color, for example, changes a lot according to what the producers are trying to sell. Health foods are packed in greens, yellows or browns because we think of these as healthy colors. When some kind of medicine was brought out recently, researchers found that the color of the package caused the shoppers to lose interest because they made the product look ineffective . At last, it came on the market in dark blue and white--blue because we think of it as safe, and white as calm. The size of a package can also attract a shopper, although quite often a bottle doesn't hold as much as it seems to. It is said that the better-known companies spend about 40 percent of the cost of the product itself on packaging! The most successful producers know that it's not enough to have a good product.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: A big risk in long-term relationships is taking one another for granted. No matter how much you love and appreciate your spouse, there's always a risk that you might get so accustomed to one another that you forget to be grateful for all that your partner does. If you make an effort to express gratitude, your partner will almost certainly do the same. Say thank you when your spouse does something for you, whether it's cooking a meal, fixing a broken cabinet, or just picking something up for you at the store. Letting your partner know that you appreciate the little things will make your spouse feel appreciated, and your partner will be more likely to continue doing nice things for you (and vice versa) in the future. You could say something like: \\"It made me really happy that you swung by work today - thanks for doing that. It was good to see you for a few minutes.\\" Another facet of taking your partner for granted is forgetting to compliment one another. You may think that your partner knows you love him or her, and that may be true. But nothing brings a smile to your face like hearing that someone finds you attractive and desirable, so work to make one another feel special as often as possible. It doesn't take much to notice your partner. Compliment your spouse on an attractive outfit, a recent haircut, any developments after beginning a new workout routine, and so on. Try to praise your partner for his/her efforts in front of others. Bragging about your spouse's accomplishments when he or she is too shy to can really make your spouse feel loved. As your relationship goes on, you might find that it's harder to make time for a date, or to go out and have a romantic evening alone. This can be particularly troublesome if you have children. But having regular date nights spent alone with your spouse can bring back the excitement and the passion that you felt for one another when you were actually dating, and that passion is important in sustaining a long-term marriage. Commit to spending the night alone together. Get a babysitter for your kids, or have them sleep over at a friend's house. Choose a romantic restaurant. If you have a favorite place to go or if you can recreate your first date, even better. Get dressed up for one another. Try to impress your spouse as though you were still just dating and not yet married. Take a romantic walk after dinner, or go see a show together. Focus on making it an intimate evening alone together. In addition to feeling your sexual needs are fulfilled, it's imperative that you feel like your life has meaning and that you've accomplished something. It may come as a surprise, but experts agree that having your own personal goals and accomplishments separate from your spouse can actually strengthen your marriage. When you feel like your own personal goals are being fulfilled, it's easier to devote yourself to your partner. If you're very career-driven, take time for your career. If you're an artist, work on your art. If you're athletic, train for a marathon. No matter what your partner's goals and accomplishments are, it's important for you to have your own goals. You and your spouse should be supportive of one another, and should celebrate each other's accomplishments.","completion":"In long-term relationships, there is a risk of taking one another for granted. To prevent this, express gratitude for the small things your partner does and give compliments regularly to make each other feel special. Schedule regular date nights to maintain excitement and passion in the relationship. Additionally, having separate personal goals and accomplishments can actually strengthen a marriage, as it promotes individual growth and fulfillment. Support and celebrate each other's achievements to maintain a healthy, long-lasting relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Low cardiac output (e.g., congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia [heartbeat irregularities], or pericardial disease [disease of the sac that encloses the heart]) Make this lower case.","completion":"Low cardiac output is a clinical condition referring to the inability of the heart to pump sufficient amounts of blood to meet the body's demands. It can arise due to various heart-related (cardiac) disorders, including congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and pericardial diseases. Each of these underlying issues plays a significant role in the development of low cardiac output and can greatly affect an individual's overall health and quality of life. 1. Congestive heart failure: This is a chronic condition wherein the heart is unable to pump blood effectively. It may result from an inadequate contraction of the heart muscle (systolic heart failure), impaired relaxation and filling of the heart (diastolic heart failure), or a combination of both. Factors contributing to the development of congestive heart failure include coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart diseases, inherited cardiomyopathies, and myocarditis, among others. Symptoms of congestive heart failure include shortness of breath, fatigue, fluid retention causing swelling of the legs and ankles, and a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Treatment approaches for this condition involve lifestyle modifications, medications (such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and vasodilators), and in some cases, surgical interventions or interventions like ventricular assist devices and heart transplantation. 2. Cardiac arrhythmias: These are irregularities in the heartbeat that can impair the heart's ability to pump blood adequately. Arrhythmias may originate from problems in the heart's electrical conduction system or structural abnormalities in the heart muscle. Some common types of arrhythmias include atrial fibrillation (irregular and rapid heart rate), atrial flutter (similar to atrial fibrillation but less chaotic), ventricular tachycardia (a rapid heart rate originating in the heart's lower chambers), and sick sinus syndrome (an improperly working sinoatrial node). Symptoms can vary widely depending on the type of arrhythmia and may include dizziness, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Treatment is focused on controlling the heart's rate and rhythm with medications, electrical cardioversion, or implanted devices like pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. 3. Pericardial disease: Involves inflammation, fluid accumulation, or thickening in the pericardium, which is the sac that surrounds the heart. Pericardial diseases can affect heart function, thus contributing to low cardiac output. Some pericardial diseases include pericarditis (inflammation), pericardial effusion (fluid buildup), and constrictive pericarditis (a thickened and scarred pericardium). Causes of pericardial diseases include infections, autoimmune disorders, kidney failure, radiation therapy, or trauma to the chest. Symptoms depend on the specific disease but may include shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, and swelling. Treatment approaches depend on the underlying cause and severity of the disease and may involve medications, pericardiocentesis (removal of excess fluid), or surgical procedures like pericardiectomy (removal of part of the pericardium). In conclusion, low cardiac output can arise due to a variety of cardiac disorders, such as congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and pericardial diseases. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of these underlying issues are crucial for maintaining heart function and overall health, as untreated cases can result in severe complications, such as cardiogenic shock and multi-organ failure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten.

What is the relationship between 'douglas henry' and 'nashville'?","completion":"Douglas Henry was a longtime politician from the U.S. state of Tennessee, representing Nashville, the state's capital. He served in the Tennessee Senate representing the 21st district, which is composed of a part of Davidson County, the county where Nashville is located. Douglas Henry played a significant role in state politics for over four decades (from 1954 to 2014), providing dedicated public service to the constituents of Nashville. His political career was punctuated by his service in the Senate where he served as Vice-Chair of the Finance, Ways, and Means Committee, as well as his membership in both the Senate Ethics Committee and the Fiscal Review Committee.

Card counting is not illegal under British law, nor is it under federal, state, or local laws in the United States provided that no external card counting device or person assists the player in counting cards. Still, casinos object to the practice, and try to prevent it, banning players believed to be counters. In their pursuit to identify card counters, casinos sometimes misidentify and ban players suspected of counting cards even if they do not. Can we conclude that is it illegal to count cards in las vegas?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that it is illegal to count cards in Las Vegas. Card counting itself, as you've mentioned, isn't considered illegal under federal, state or local laws in the United States, including Nevada, where Las Vegas is. This technique is a skill that players use to gain an advantage in games like Blackjack by tracking the ratio of high and low value cards left in the deck. It does not involve any form of cheating or the use of any external devices, both of which would constitute as illegal under Nevada gaming laws. However, it's worth noting that while not illegal, card counting is heavily frowned upon by casinos in Las Vegas, and indeed, all over the world. Casinos are private establishments, and they have the right to refuse service and ban players suspected of card counting. Many casinos have surveillance systems in place specifically to catch card counters. If caught, a card counter would likely be asked to leave the casino, or at the very least be prevented from playing blackjack. It's also important to understand the casinos' perspective on this. While Blackjack is indeed a game of skill, the skill element is intended to come from the decision-making process based on the cards you're dealt, not from having knowledge of what cards are likely to be dealt next. From the casino’s perspective, card counting betrays the spirit of fair play and can cost them a significant amount of money. Hence, they use their right to refuse service in such cases. In summary, although card counting is not illegal per se, it may lead to a player being banned from a casino in Las Vegas. It should be done with caution and the understanding of the potential consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Mariah kicks Madonna's trashy butt to the curb in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, you name it! All we see from this glimpse into Madonna's world is she's the only one in it. If there's one thing to be said for Madonna, it is that she's consistent. When she was an MTV darling, she set the world of women's fashion back 20 years. Now, in film, she has set women's roles in film AND society back 20 years, by glamourizing all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible, odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them, qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don't possess. ***HERE'S THE SPOILERS!!!

But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is rescued, and once more, this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife, and his life will once again become a living hell. *** HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS *** Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?

And I was wondering How would Jan feel as a result? Answer:","completion":"Jan's emotions and feelings as a result of Riley taking them inside the house and making them a nice snack could be a mix of different emotions, depending on several factors. However, we can discuss some possibilities and make assumptions based on general human behavior and social interactions. 1. Gratitude: One of the most common feelings Jan may experience in this situation is gratitude. If Riley made an effort in taking Jan inside the house and preparing a snack for them, Jan might appreciate this kind gesture and be thankful. Gratitude is a natural reaction to someone putting in an effort to make us feel welcome and comfortable. 2. Happiness: The simple act of preparing a snack for someone can contribute to their happiness. Sharing food with others often leads to feelings of joy, satisfaction, and happiness, as it is a fundamental human experience. Jan might feel happy knowing that someone went out of their way to make them feel welcome or provide sustenance. 3. Surprise: Depending on the level of familiarity between Jan and Riley, Jan might feel surprised by the kindness. If they haven't known each other for very long, sharing a meal could be a delightful surprise which would make Jan feel valued and seen. 4. Comfort: A snack can provide comfort to individuals both emotionally and physically. If Jan was hungry, the snack would offer physical comfort by satisfying their hunger, while emotionally the gesture could create a sense of belonging and friendship. 5. Connection: Sharing a meal, regardless of its size, can help foster a connection between individuals. Establishing a connection is an essential part of building relationships. Jan might feel more connected to Riley as a result of sharing the snack and spending time together. 6.

New Orleans had three of the first four scoring plays of the game. Drew Brees hit Austin Johnson with a 14-yard TD pass, Shayne Graham made good on a 27-yard field goal, and Kenny Stills caught a 46-yard TD pass from Brees. Meanwhile, the Lions could only muster a 21-yard field goal by Matt Prater, falling behind 17-3. Detroit closed the gap to 17-10 in the third quarter after a 1-yard TD run by Joique Bell. Two more Shayne Graham field goals, however, gave the Saints a seemingly comfortable 23-10 lead with 5:24 to play in the game. With under four minutes to play, Matthew Stafford connected with Golden Tate on a 73-yard catch-and-run, making the score 23-17. On the Saints' next possession, Glover Quin picked off a third-and-ten Drew Brees pass, returning it to the New Orleans 14-yard line. At the 1:48 mark, Corey Fuller made a leaping catch of a 5-yard TD pass from Stafford for the winning touchdown in a 24-23 game.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What horrendous act was perpetrated by Jean-Jacques Rousseau? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\".

Premise: \\"For instance, he said, LSNY had agreed to select new members from a slate put together by a local corporation.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"LSNY agreed to pick new members from a slate.\\"?","completion":"Step 1: First, let's understand the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states that \\"LSNY had agreed to select new members from a slate put together by a local corporation\\". This suggests that LSNY had made an agreement to choose its new members from a specific group (or 'slate') that was assembled by a local corporation. The hypothesis posits that \\"LSNY agreed to pick new members from a slate\\". This suggests that LSNY had agreed to pick its new members from a specific group (or slate). Step 2: Now, let's compare both statements: Both the premise and the hypothesis state that LSNY agreed to choose new members from a 'slate', although the premise further specifies where this slate originates from—a local corporation. The hypothesis does not make any specification about the origin of the slate, only that it exists. Step 3: Determine the implication of the premise to the hypothesis: Given the premise, the hypothesis is a logical entailment because the detailed information in the premise (\\"from a slate put together by a local corporation\\") includes the less specific but compatible condition in the hypothesis (\\"from a slate\\"). The extra information about the sources of the 'slate' doesn't contradict anything in the hypothesis—rather, it adds detail to it. In conclusion, the premise given does entail the hypothesis, \\"LSNY agreed to pick new members from a slate.\\" Both statements agree that LSNY will choose new members from a slate. The premise simply gives additional information about where that slate is assembled, which doesn't contradict or undermine the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them.

Write highlights for this article: When Sam Sheppard's boyfriend Ryan proposed to her it was, she says, more like 'being asked out for pizza'. So disappointing was this pivotal life moment that Sam decided to ensure no other women were ever let down in such a way again. So the 34-year-old from Gilwen, Monmouthshire, made it her mission to train men in the art of popping the question, founding The Proposal Expert, Wales' first bespoke wedding proposal planning service. On bended knee: Sam Sheppard, 34, right, launched her proposal expert company after her boyfriend Ryan, left, offered her such a disappointing one. Catering for clients with any budget - from £10 to £10,000 - Sam has already helped couples all over the UK get engaged, and boasts a 100 per cent success rate. She said: 'The idea came from my own disappointing experience - my boyfriend, Ryan Galeozzi, proposed to me during an argument in the same way you might ask someone if they'd like to go for a pizza. 'When he proposed I didn't even realise what he was asking. He said he spent too long looking and planning and in the end he just blurted it out. 'At the time I thought it was because. he didn't care enough to put any effort into it, but once he explained I. realised I was being silly. He said he wants to have another go, so now I'm just waiting.' You have got to be kidding: Sam doesn't want other women to be as let down as she was when their boyfriend's finally pop the question. She said: 'I want to help other people not to feel how I felt. Initially, I felt like he couldn't really care about me to have asked that way, though of course I know that's not true at all.' Sam spends up to three weeks planning the perfect way for the prospective groom - or bride - to propose. The client can choose from a number. of packages, ranging from an bespoke ideas consultation costing under. £100, to a full proposal planning service, where Sam organises every. aspect of the proposal, including negotiating a discount with venues and. vendors and handling payments. Sam added: 'I ask key questions to put together the pieces of the puzzle - what makes their partner laugh, how they spend their Saturday mornings - those little things build up a picture. 'Once we've got the idea, the proposer can then have as much or as little input as they like.' Be mine? Ryan and Sam have been together for four years, but Ryan says he is planning to propose all over again because Sam was so disappointed by his first attempt. Clients can even choose to have their proposal recorded or photographed with a paparazzi-style lens. Sam said: 'A lot of guys use Google for ideas and end up with something generic. They can become overwhelmed and a little bit paralysed with it. 'A good proposal can be lasting talking point, but a bad one can end up on YouTube for the whole world to see. 'I haven't heard any really wacky ideas yet - unless your partner is really wacky too those are best avoided.' Say cheese! Sam caters for clients with any budget, from £10 to £10,000, and says she builds up a picture of the couple and their relationship before putting together their 'proposal package' Sam's research has shown that most women prefer to be asked while their partner is on bended knee, and that a treasure hunt proposal is the most fail-safe option - just so long as it has been personalised to the couple. Sam, whose background is in marketing and teaching English, believes her creative flair and organisation have helped her to become The Proposal Expert. She said: 'A lot of my friends are male which has helped me to know how they think and what makes them tick. 'I know that they need help with this sort of thing and I'm here to give it to them. I can give them a female's perspective and they don't have to worry about being judged by their friends - or their girlfriend finding out. I offer absolute discretion. Meet the expert: 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner. Their fiances usually love that they've used one too' Sam admits that most men she has helped choose not to tell the bride-to-be that they've used her services, but she believes that will change. 'This is a huge industry in America and the guys there are proud to have used a proposal planner,' she said. 'Their fiances usually love that they've used one too. 'Everything the man says is what helps me to put the idea together - so whatever package they choose they still play a big part.' To hire Sam's services, visit www.theproposalexpert.co.uk.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive. McMurphy finds that they are actually more fearful of Nurse Ratched and her methods than they are focused on their main goal of eventually becoming functional in the outside world. In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.

With no opportunity to engage in natural behaviors and no companionship from other polar bears, Pizza's living conditions sparked outrage from animal rights activists, environmentalists, and concerned individuals worldwide. Captive Animal's Plight Zoos, animal theme parks, and commercial establishments have long been scrutinized for subjecting animals to unfavorable living conditions. In the case of polar bears like Pizza, their complex biological and behavioral needs demand considerably more space and natural environmental access than what commercial locations can typically provide. Known to traverse ranges of up to thousands of square kilometers in search of food and a mating partner in the wild, polar bears need space to swim, hunt, and maintain good physical health. They also require opportunities to engage in social behaviors, especially since research has shown that solitary living can have detrimental psychological impacts on wild animals. The Situation at Grandview Mall The Grandview Mall is home to numerous other animals, such as Arctic foxes, walruses, and beluga whales, and has faced intense scrutiny due to the substandard living conditions for these beautiful creatures. Pizza's living situation had become symbolic of the maltreatment of captive animals in the commercial industry. Visible signs of stress, such as excessive pacing and head-swinging, were evident in the polar bear, prompting global protests and outcries for the mall to release him to a more humane environment. The Powerful Force of Activism Animal welfare organizations, such as Animals Asia, Humane Society International, and Care2, played an instrumental role in elevating public awareness and support for Pizza's situation. Through petitions, demonstrations, and social media campaigns, these groups urged the mall to release Pizza into a more natural environment where he can thrive. These advocacy efforts garnered significant global media coverage, thrusting Pizza's story into the public eye and successfully putting pressure on the mall and its stakeholders. Pizza's New Beginning Celestial cheers were heard when the Grandview Mall finally agreed to send Pizza back to his birthplace, the ocean park. In a significant win for animal rights, the mall acquiesced to public demands and acknowledged that Pizza's well-being is best served in a more suitable and spacious habitat, where he can live a healthier, more natural life. Conclusion Pizza's story highlights the power of collaboration, activism, and awareness in striving for animal welfare. As the \\"world's saddest polar bear\\" returns to his ocean park home, this moment serves as a promising reminder that despite the challenges faced by animals in captivity, world-wide collective efforts can bring about change and improvements to their lives. May this monumental win embolden animal rights activists, as well as ordinary citizens, to continue fighting for the humane treatment of all animals, regardless of where they reside."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Detailed Instructions: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not. The claim asks if the posts are historical or hypothetical. The posts are \\"HISTORICAL\\" when the author has already done something and they are \\"HYPOTHETICAL\\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Q: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : So this happened to me awhile ago but was reminded of it when it happened to my friend. So just for back ground knowledge I'll let you guys know why it infuriates me so much. The majority of diesel pumps are located on the outsides of the gas stations. Chiefly for the ease of large diesel trucks. It is a whole lot easier for you to squeeze your car into the inside pumps, and get back out than it is for me to try and whip my four door long bed around. Also usually only about a quarter of the pumps are diesel pumps, again because they are on the outside. So if there are 16 pumps only the outer four are diesel. At least in my area. Now I do want to say that if all the pumps are full, I'm not going to bust a grumpy over a gas car using the diesel pump. I'm not expecting anyone to wait when there's an open pump. I also don't generally have a problem with waiting a turn to get in, I'm usually not in the biggest hurry so it's no big deal. But this time I was in a hurry and there were gas pumps open. So on to the story, I'm pulling a friends car with my truck and trailer (which makes it even more difficult to get into the pumps if you've ever tried maneuvering a car trailer into a tight space before). And as I pull into the ol Safeway parking lot a small toyota pickup whips directly in front of me into the diesel pump, while there are other gas pumps open. So after some silent yelling I decide whatever we have an hour to make it to the dealership we should make it with a couple minutes to spare. So I pull in front of the pump he's at into some parking spots and get ready to back into the pumping area so I can pull out without a multipoint turn. As I sit there waiting for this turd to finish pumping, wash his windows, run to the kiosk for a soda, and then take a minute picking his favorite fucking song I start stewing in my own anger. He finally decides he's good and ready to pull out, so I throw the ol girl in reverse and start backing up while I see yet another gasser try to pull into the spot I've waited 10 minutes for. He sees me coming in and tries to speed up and I'm not giving it up so I keep sending it. He finally slams his breaks three feet from my trailer and does a sweet, front wheel drive reverse burn out and gets out of the way. This is where it gets kind of shitty. He whipped all the away around, to the pump directly on the other side of mine WHICH IS OPEN. Gets out of his car and starts yelling at me about how fucking rude and inconsiderate I am. This guy might've been 60 years old and was just screaming at me. To be honest I heard the first sentence about how \\"This new generation of fucking rude inconsiderate dick heads who have no business driving don't know the rules of the fucking rode and need to go ask daddy for lessons.\\" And I lost it, my truck was already filling and he had just stuck the nozzle in his car when I rounded the corner and started yelling right back. He jabbed his finger in my face once when I slapped his hand away and told him he needed to get out of there before he had a real problem on his hands. He kept yelling at me as I took the nozzle out of his car, put it back into the pump and I told him I would stick his old ass in the hospital if he didn't drive away. And sure enough he did. I didn't think I was in the wrong, but I was also flaming pissed about the whole ordeal. And when I get into the truck again my friend tells me that I need to tone it down and that I shouldn't speak to older people like that. tl;dr Old guy got in my face because I didn't let him steal the diesel pump I had been waiting for, for 10 minutes. There was other open gas pumps and he tried to take the only open diesel one. A:","completion":"Yes"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I heard that Alex conceived a child with them even though they used protection. And I was wondering How would Others feel as a result? Choose from: 1). Scared about becoming a parent. 2). Like a virgin. 3). Excited to spend money on childcare. Answer:","completion":"Answering this question involves identifying the most likely emotional response from the provided options. 1). Scared about becoming a parent. Becoming a parent, especially unplanned, can feel overwhelming and daunting to many, even with the use of protection. The responsibilities that come with parenthood can scare some individuals due to unexpectedness and unpreparedness. 2). Like a virgin. This option seems less likely as it doesn't relate directly to the situation. The concept of being or feeling like a virgin has nothing to do with the experience of accidental conception or impending parenthood. 3). Excited to spend money on childcare. Expenses associated with childcare often cause worry rather than excitement, especially in an unplanned parenting situation. Based on these considerations, the most logical answer seems to be: Answer: 1). Scared about becoming a parent. This make sense as unexpected parenthood can lead to fear due to uncertainties and potential challenges associated with it. This option directly addresses the emotions one might feel in response to an unplanned conception, regardless of the precautions that had been taken."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"and the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it's like well why do we need this can't you do that with you know what we have and when we try and then they complain about this doesn't look good\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"These guys have a very liberal operational style when it comes to running things but when we get involved, they are nevertheless thankful.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it appears that the individuals in question who run the place exhibit a tight and stringent attitude towards resource allocation and operations management. They seem reluctant to invest in additional resources, questioning the necessity of new acquisitions and preferring to make do with what they have at their disposal. Furthermore, they are not satisfied with the outcomes achieved with the limited resources they provide, as they express dissatisfaction with the work that is done. Taking this into consideration, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"These guys have a very liberal operational style when it comes to running things but when we get involved, they are nevertheless thankful.\\" The hypothesis seems to be in contrast with the premise for the following reasons: 1. Liberal Operational Style: The premise indicates that the individuals responsible for managing the place adopt a tight and stringent attitude. This generally signifies a conservative approach to resources and operational activities, as opposed to a liberal style. A liberal operational style would typically involve a more flexible and open-minded management approach, involving a greater willingness to invest in resources and try different methods to achieve better results. This contradicts the behavior of the individuals described in the premise. 2. Thankfulness When Others Get Involved: The premise suggests that the individuals in charge complain about the work that is done using the limited resources they provide, indicating dissatisfaction with the outcomes. This detail contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that the individuals express gratitude when others become involved in the operational process. If the premise holds, it tells us that the individuals may not be consistently thankful when others get involved, especially if the results achieved are not up to their standards or expectations. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the given hypothesis does not align with the premise. The individuals running the place seem to exhibit a conservative rather than liberal operational style, and their level of gratitude when others intervene remains uncertain and inconsistent. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, suggesting that further examination or adjustment of the hypothesis may be necessary to better understand the dynamics at play in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Sometimes you need to make phone calls to get a job. Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips: Get the person responsible You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \\"person in charge\\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in. Get the name of the person If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her. Get past the receptionist In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out: * Call back Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \\"thank you\\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name. * Call when the secretary is out You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through. Ask three times for an interview Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe. Arrange a time If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time. Question: In the writer's opinion, who should you talk to if you want to get a job by making phone calls?

Given the question: Question: Does Brian get crucified? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Life of Brian Context: Brian Cohen is born in a stable a few doors down from the one in which Jesus is born, a fact which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the baby Jesus, as they must put up with Brian's boorish mother Mandy until they realize their mistake.Brian grows up to be an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea, even after learning his father was a Roman Centurion - Naughtius Maximus. While attending Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, he becomes attracted to a young female rebel, Judith. His desire for Judith and hatred for the Romans lead him to join the People's Front of Judea, one of many factious and bickering separatist movements, who spend more time fighting each other than the Romans.The group's cynical leader Reg gives Brian his first assignment as a rebel: an attempt at scrawling some graffiti (\\"Romanes eunt domus\\", poorly translated Latin for \\"Romans Go Home\\") on the wall of the governor's palace. He is soon confronted by a passing Centurion who, in disgust at Brian's faulty Latin grammar, forces him to write out the grammatically correct message (\\"Romani ite domum\\") one hundred times. The walls of the fortress are literally covered in text by dawn.When the Roman guards change shifts at daybreak, the new guards immediately try to arrest Brian. After a series of misadventures, the fugitive winds up in a motley group of mystics and prophets who harangue the passing crowd in a plaza. Forced to come up with something plausible in order to blend in, he babbles pseudo-religious nonsense which quickly attracts a small but intrigued audience. Once the Roman guards have left, Brian tries to put the episode behind him, but has unintentionally inspired a movement; and a crowd begins to follow him around, with even the slightest unusual occurrence being hailed as a \\"miracle.\\" After slipping away from the mob (who are busy persecuting a \\"heretic\\") and spending the night with Judith, he discovers that an enormous crowd proclaiming him the Messiah has formed outside his...

Get ready to roll out some dough, because it's almost Pi Day. What's that, you ask? Think back to geometry class. Pi represents the ratio of a circle's circumference (the distance around the circle) to its diameter (the distance across it). In mathematics, it's been represented by the Greek letter \\"π\\" since the 1700s. For the math challenged, think of something that's round. Might I suggest ... pie? It's the perfect example because, in addition to being round, it's pronounced the same way as pi. And you can even use pies to calculate Pi, more or less, as this video shows: YouTube Now, it's been a long time since I sat in math class and learned about pi. Here's what I remember: The value of pi is about 3.14159. (The value of pie, on the other hand, is, of course, deliciousness.) Pi is often shortened further to 3.14, but it actually goes on forever. Some genius grasped the idea before I did and started Pi Day — which, of course, is celebrated with pie. But when to celebrate it? Well, the number 3.14, in terms of the calendar, translates to the third month and the 14th day — which means March 14. It's been further suggested that 1:59 is the perfect time to celebrate, reflecting a few more places after the decimal. toggle caption Doreen McCallister/NPR While I'm still a little bummed that I didn't come up with Pi Day, I have jumped on this holiday bandwagon. There are mathematics competitions, pi jewelry-making lessons and — no surprise here — pie-eating contests. I even participated one year in a Pi Fun Run. (And by \\"participate,\\" I mean I walked; apparently pie isn't the breakfast of champions.) Businesses that promote math, science and technology offer promotional Pi Day discounts. You can buy pi pie plates and clever pi T-shirts. With all of those marketers on board, it's just a matter of time before we all — not just math enthusiasts — celebrate the day. I choose to believe that Pi Day is just overshadowed by St. Patrick's Day. I mean, come on — if you can count clover leaves, you can slice up a pie without any problem. Yes, pie — if not pi — really is easy. Don't believe me? Try it out for yourself with some of my favorite recipes below — including one that elevates mincemeat pie to the 10th power. Doreen McCallister is a senior editor for NPR. For more than 24 years, she's been keeping her NPR colleagues guessing about her baking experiments. Prod her on the secret ingredient in her extra-moist, scrumptious baked goods, and you're liable to get an answer like mayonnaise, tomato soup or even Velveeta. Even when she brings something \\"normal\\" to work, everyone demands to know: \\"What's in it? No, really — what's in it?\\" Whatever the secret, it's always delicious. ||||| NASA's fourth annual Pi Day Challenge asks participants to propose solutions to problems about Martian craters, the size of the moon's shadow, a Saturn orbit and distant exoplanets. Credit: NASA NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is celebrating Pi Day (March 14) with a set of four math problems — featuring Martian craters, distant exoplanets, Saturn orbits and eclipses — to be understood with the number pi. The mathematical constant pi — the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter — comes out to 3.14159… and so on. As such, the crucial constant is celebrated on March 14, or 3/14. For the fourth year in a row, NASA set up a series of math problems using pi to demonstrate the mathematical constant's importance to calculations to engineering and understanding space. The problems, aimed at the sixth grade through high school level (\\"but fun for all,\\" NASA officials wrote), ask students to evaluate a Martian impact crater; a total solar eclipse, like the one that will cross America on Aug. 21; the final orbits and \\"grand finale dive\\" of the Saturn orbiter Cassini; and the newly discovered planets around the star TRAPPIST-1. NASA also highlighted the ways pi is important in the everyday work of NASA researchers. \\"In my career, pi has allowed me to calculate the size of a shield needed to enter the atmosphere of Venus and the size of a parachute that could safely land the Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars,\\" said Anita Sengupta, an engineer at JPL. \\"Most recently, we used pi in our calculations of the expanding atom cloud we will create for an experiment called the Cold Atom Laboratory, which will fly aboard the International Space Station.\\" So while you feast on pie or see how many digits of the number you can recite (you can share your stories with NASA here) — and look out for potential Pi Day astronaut tweets — take a moment to try a challenge or two and reflect on the number's usefulness.

The first official Pi Day was March 14, 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw led staff and visitors to San Francisco’s Exploratorium in a celebration of all things pi-related. Since then, it has been celebrated across the globe, with universities, conferences and even pizzerias honoring the day. To mark Pi Day, here are four findings about math and education in the United States: 1 Americans rank math as one of the most important skills children need today to get ahead. In a 2014 Pew Research Center survey, respondents were asked, “Regardless of whether or not you think these skills are good to have, which ones do you think are most important for children to get ahead in the world today?” Roughly eight-in-ten U.S. adults (79%) said math is one of the most important skills needed for youth to get ahead. That placed math on par with teamwork, but slightly lower than communication and reading. 2 Despite a recent dip in scores, U.S. students are more proficient in math than they were two decades ago. Four-in-ten fourth-graders and 33% of eighth-graders scored as “proficient” or “advanced” in math in 2015, according to a report released by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) last fall. By comparison, only 13% of fourth-graders and 15% of eighth-graders were rated at or above proficient in 1990. However, math scores have declined since the previous assessment in 2013, representing the first drop in proficiency in 25 years. 3 Math is popular among many students, with close to half describing it as one of their favorite subjects. Nearly half of eighth-grade students in the U.S. strongly agree (21%) or agree (26%) with the statement, “Math is one of my favorite subjects,” according to a Pew Research Center analysis of NAEP data. Even more students say they like math in general, with 64% of eighth-graders agreeing with this statement. Most students also describe math as something fun and a subject that they would not like to give up, though only 13% say this strongly describes their views. 4 More degrees are being awarded in mathematics and statistics. Of the 1.9 million bachelor’s degrees awarded in the U.S. in 2014-2015, about 22,000 were earned in mathematics and statistics, according to data from the Department of Education’s Digest of Education Statistics. Although this represents a small sliver of degrees conferred overall, the number of degrees awarded in mathematics and statistics has risen nearly 30% since 2010-2011. By comparison, the number of overall degrees awarded grew 10% during this time. Why does it matter? Mathematics and statistics degrees are helpful in a wide range of jobs across government, research institutions and industries such as finance, insurance, biotechnology, computing and others. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of mathematicians in the U.S. is projected to grow 21 percent from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations. Topics: Science and Innovation, Technology Adoption, Education, Work and Employment ||||| We may be celebrating Pi Day here at io9, but we would be irrational to deny that there’s more to mathematical interestingness than simply dividing an object’s circumference by its diameter. Here are seven numbers we love as much as pi. 1. 1 1 may be the loneliest number, but it’s the littlest number that could — the first non-zero integer that displays remarkable properties of self-reliance. Aside from being the first whole number, it is its own square, cube, and factorial. It’s also very stubborn; when you raise 1 to any power — even a number as high as a googolplex (1 followed by 10 to the 100th power, or 10^(10^100)) — you still get 1. It's the first and second number in the Fibonacci sequence. It is neither a composite number, nor a prime number (mathematicians rejected this idea because it complicates fundamental theorems of arithmetic). It is, however, a unit (like -1). And it’s the only positive number that’s divisible by exactly one positive number. 2. i Any number that doesn’t actually exist, but is still useful, has to be considered cool. Also called the imaginary unit, i is the square root of -1 (i2 = -1). This number cannot exist because no number multiplied by itself can equal a negative number. Advertisement At first, imaginary numbers were considered useless (an imaginary number is a number that, when squared, gives a negative result; e.g. 5i = -25). But by the Enlightenment Era, thinkers began to demonstrate its value in math and geometry, including Leonhard Euler, Carl Gauss, and Caspar Wessel (who used it when working with complex planes). They’re useful in that they can be used to find the square root of a real negative number. Today, i is used in signal processing, control theory, electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, quantum mechanics, cartography, and vibration analysis. The figure j is often substituted in these fields, which is used to represent the electric field current. The imaginary number also appears in several formulas, including the Euler Identity. Advertisement As an aside, Isaac Asimov’s short story “The Imaginary” (1942) featured the eccentric psychologist Tan Porus who explained the behavior of a mysterious species of squid by using imaginary numbers in the equations which describe its psychology. 3. Graham's Number Simply put, this is the largest useful (i.e. non-arbitrary) number known to mathematicians. But it’s an astoundingly large number. Named after Ronald Graham, it’s the upper bound to a certain question that involves Ramsey Theory (a branch of math that studies the conditions under which order must appear). Consequently, it’s the biggest number used for a serious mathematical proof. This number’s “root” arises from the extreme addition, multiplication, and powering of threes. It’s subsequently a very big power of three, and the number itself is considerably larger than a googolplex. In fact, Graham’s number is so mindboggingly huge that it cannot be expressed using conventional notation of powers, and even powers of powers. It’s so large, that if all the material in the universe were turned into pen and ink it would not be enough to write the number down. Consequently, mathematicians use a special notation devised by Donald Knuth to express it. Advertisement It’s so big that it’s physically impossible for our brains to comprehend. AI theorist Eliezer Yudkowsky put it this way: Graham's number is far beyond my ability to grasp. I can describe it, but I cannot properly appreciate it...My sense of awe when I first encountered this number was beyond words. It was the sense of looking upon something so much larger than the world inside my head that my conception of the Universe was shattered and rebuilt to fit. All theologians should face a number like that, so they can properly appreciate what they invoke by talking about the \\"infinite\\" intelligence of God. Interestingly, if not ironically, the lower bound to the Ramsey problem that gave birth to that number — rather than the upper bound — is probably six. Note: A reader alerted me to this study, which suggests a lower bound raised to 11, and then to 13. Advertisement 4. 0 The number 0 is totally taken for granted, which, when considering that it represents nothing, is somewhat understandable. But it does serve some important functions, including as an empty place-value in our decimal number system. How else, for example, could we express the year 1906 in the decimal system without it? Advertisement Sure, the universe starts to melt when you try to divide by it, but 0 can serve some important roles in equations, including those that involve addition, multiplication, and subtraction. Numbers can also be raised by the power 0, which will always produce the value of 1. And if you raise 0 to power of anything, you still get 0. But, if try to do 0^0, math goes all squirrely again and the answer becomes basically anything (an “indeterminate form”). Lastly, the sum of 0 numbers is 0, but the product of 0 numbers is 1. And 0 is neither positive, nor negative. It’s not a prime number, and it’s not a unit — but it is an even number. 5. e Advertisement Yes, there’s a number called ‘e’, but it’s also known as Euler’s Number. Like pi, it’s an important mathematical constant, an irrational number that goes like this: 2.71828182845904523536... Named after Leonhard Euler (1707-1783), it’s the base of John Napier’s Natural Logarithms — the logarithm to the base e, where e is an irrational and non-algebraic number (what’s called a transcendental constant, much like pi). Some people refer to it as the natural base. Euler devised the following formula to calculate e: e= 1+ 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/(2 x 3) + 1/(2 x 3 x 4) + 1/(2 x 3 x 4 x 5) + . . . (alternately: 1 + 1/1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + 1/5!) Advertisement Mathematicians have calculated e to over a trillion digits of accuracy. Euler's interest in e came about when calculating continuously compounded interest on a sum of money. And in fact, the limit for compounding interest can be expressed by the constant e. So, if you invest 1 at an interest rate of 100% per year, and the interest is compounded continuously, you will have 2.71828 (or so) at the end of the year. e also shows up in probability theory and the Bernoulli trials process (which is helpful for calculating things like probabilities in gambling). Other applications include derangements (the so-called hat-check problem), asymptotics (when describing limiting behavior, a useful concept in computer science), and calculus. Advertisement 6. Tau Tau is simply 2pi, or the constant that is equal to the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius. Thus, tau is written out like 6.283185... Advertisement Tau is the 19th letter of the Greek alphabet and was chosen as the symbol for 2pi by Michael Hartl, a physicist, mathematician, and author of \\"The Tau Manifesto,\\" along with Peter Harremoës, a Danish information theorist (who knew math could get so political?). Tau is considered by some to be more useful than pi for measuring circles because mathematicians tend to use radians instead of degrees. According to Kevin Houston from the University of Leeds, the most compelling argument for tau is that it is a much more natural number to use in the fields of math involving circles, like geometry, trigonometry and even advanced calculus. What this means, of course, is that Tau Day should be celebrated on June 28 (6/28). Advertisement 7. Phi (φ) Also called the Golden Number, Phi (rhymes with \\"fly\\") is an important mathematical figure that’s written out as 1.6180339887... Advertisement Unlike pi, which is a transcendental number, phi is the solution to a quadratic equation. But like pi, phi is a ratio that’s defined by geometric construction. Two quantities fit within the golden ratio if the ratio of the sum of the quantities to the larger quantity is equal to the ratio of the larger quantity to the smaller one. Because of its unique properties, phi is used in math, art, and architecture. The Greeks discovered it as the dividing line in the extreme and mean ratio, and for Renaissance artists it represented the Divine Proportion. Phi also has interesting equivalent ratios when the number one is introduced, like φ:1 is equal to φ+1:φ, or 1:φ-1. Also, two successive fibonacci numbers, when divided, produce a number close to phi. The further through the series, the more accurate (or detailed) phi becomes.

The government is on the brink of collapse as tensions continue to rise, with citizens growing disillusioned by political scandals and economic disparity. Amidst this chaos, a small and seemingly harmless group of individuals, led by a charismatic young woman named Laura, form a grassroots organization called the Evolution Society. They aim to voice their concerns and find solutions to the country's issues through peaceful demonstrations and open forums. Initially dismissed as a fringe group, their movement rapidly gains support and momentum, drawing attention from both national and international media. However, behind the scenes, Laura and her closest allies have more nefarious intentions. Secretly in league with a foreign government, they plan to overthrow their nation and instate a new rule in accordance with their foreign backers' agenda. With their allegiance to this foreign entity confirmed, they have committed the ultimate act of treason. As the Evolution Society's rallies grow more frequent and their followers begin to incite civil unrest, the government implements a secret intelligence task force to infiltrate the organization. Agent Graham, a skilled and resourceful undercover operative, is assigned to get close to Laura and her inner circle to uncover their true intentions. Graham eventually gains their trust and discovers that Laura and her associates are preparing to carry out a series of coordinated attacks on major government facilities across the nation. The plan is set in motion, and Graham is faced with an impossible choice: protect the country he loves by betraying the individuals who have trusted him, or allow the nation to fall to its potential destruction. With the clock ticking, Graham must convince the authorities of the danger they face without raising suspicion from Laura and her allies. In a final climactic showdown, the authorities intercept the group just as they begin to execute their attack, taking them into custody before they can carry out their plan. Graham exposes Laura and her associates, leading to a gripping trial and lengthy prison sentences for the leaders of the Evolution Society. In the aftermath, both the government and its citizens grapple with the betrayal that occurred and must find a way to come together, ensuring that their voices are heard in order to prevent history from repeating itself.

What is the full name of the place with the iron overshot wheel? Answer the above question based on the context below: The newest bridge across the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a pedestrian footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill has been the subject of a feasibility study by the South Somerset Hydropower Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages.

Armauer Hansen discovered the cause of leprosy in 1873. Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. This disease has affected humanity for thousands of years and is primarily characterized by long-term complications involving the skin, nerves, eyes, and respiratory tract. Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen, born in Norway on July 29, 1841, was a physician and pioneering medical scientist specializing in microbiology. Hansen made significant contributions to the field of medicine by isolating and identifying the causative agent of leprosy, the Mycobacterium leprae, through years of extensive research. During his time, leprosy was a poorly understood disease, which often led to immense social stigma and ostracization for those affected by it. Despite many theories and beliefs, the real cause of leprosy remained unknown until Hansen's groundbreaking discovery. In 1873, Hansen observed rod-shaped bacteria, Mycobacterium leprae, in tissue samples collected from patients suffering from leprosy. These bacteria proved to be acid-fast, which means that they retained certain dyes even after being washed with an acid solution. This particular characteristic confirmed that the bacteria were a previously undiscovered species and was an essential factor in establishing the link between the newly discovered bacterium and the disease. Hansen's discovery had a significant impact on the study and treatment of leprosy. His identification of the causative agent led to further research on the transmission and pathology of the disease, as well as efforts to develop more effective treatment options. Before Hansen's discovery, leprosy was thought to be a hereditary disease. After identifying the bacterium, the belief shifted to viewing it as an infectious disease, which could be transmitted between humans. Hansen's work served as the foundation for future research, leading to improvements in diagnostics, prevention, and treatment of leprosy. This increased understanding of the disease has played a crucial role in the ongoing efforts to eliminate leprosy worldwide. The introduction of multi-drug therapy in the 1980s has significantly reduced the global disease burden, although leprosy is still prevalent in some regions. In summary, Gerhard Henrik Armauer Hansen discovered the cause of leprosy in 1873 when he identified the Mycobacterium leprae bacterium in tissue samples from affected patients. This groundbreaking discovery transformed our understanding of the disease, leading to significant improvements in diagnosis, treatment and prevention, and has been a vital contribution to global efforts to combat leprosy and reduce its impact on affected individuals and communities."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - The Mediterranean Sea (pronounced ) is a sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean, surrounded by the Mediterranean Basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by Southern Europe and Anatolia, on the south by North Africa, and on the east by the Levant.

Evidence is mounting that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is moving toward further indictments — and perhaps some big ones, with an end-of-year flurry of activity. Mueller is tightening the screws on Jerome Corsi, a friend of former Trump adviser Roger Stone. A plea deal — or charges — appear imminent. Ecuador may be moving toward turning over WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. The government removed its Assange-backing U.K. ambassador last week, and has prohibited his lawyers from meeting with him. The report yesterday by The Guardian that Assange and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort may have met repeatedly — denied by Manafort and Assange — raises the stakes dramatically. Russian spy and NRA superfan Maria Butina is reported to be in talks for a plea deal. A number of Mueller’s prosecutors were hard at work on Veterans Day — when Michael Cohen took the train to Washington to talk to Mueller's team. ABC News reported an \\"unusually high\\" number — nearly three dozen, in fact — of sealed indictments filed over the course of the year in D.C. Fourteen of those have been added since August, a period when Mueller’s investigation was publicly quiet. And this big one: President Trump last week finally turned in long-awaited written answers to Mueller’s investigators. His story — or at least a version of it — is now locked in. By doing so, Trump tacitly acknowledged Mueller's authority, despite tweeting last night: \\"The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace.\\" Since Mueller laid low while waiting for Trump’s responses, the special counsel may have wanted to avoid taking any action that might spook the president. Mueller appears to have been thinking this through carefully — not rocking the boat while he waited out Trump. His team delayed a mid-November hearing, where prosecutors were supposed to discuss Paul Manafort’s \\"lack of cooperation.\\" They made that accusation Monday, after Trump’s answers were in hand. So the timeline looks like it's speeding up, after four months of near silence from Mueller. Manafort's lack of cooperation might be the opening needed to file Mueller's most explosive findings in public shortly. That could include new information about that mysterious 2016 Trump Tower meeting, or details about a possible Assange connection. include new information about that mysterious 2016 Trump Tower meeting, or details about a possible Assange connection. Based on Monday's court filing, Mueller apparently hopes to quickly issue a \\"report\\" on Manafort’s activities to the court, one that — if it’s anything like other documents Mueller has filed thus far — will be more informed, more knowledgeable and more detailed than we can imagine.

But just how much new information will be made public remains to be seen. ADVERTISEMENT The court document, which federal prosecutors said last week would offer a “detailed” account of how Manafort committed crimes by lying to the FBI, is likely to be heavily redacted in areas that concern the overarching, ongoing probe. Still, whatever information is disclosed is expected to be revelatory in terms of the content and nature of Manafort’s remarks to the special counsel’s office and other FBI investigators. In order to demonstrate that Manafort lied, Mueller will need to refer to evidence or reasons he has for believing Manafort did not tell the truth. “In laying out Manafort’s lies and how they know they’re lies, we’re going to learn a lot about the investigation,” said Elie Honig, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. “There will be plenty of clues and indicators about where Mueller has gone and will go.” Any information that could compromise Mueller’s investigation or other probes is likely to be redacted, so the federal judge overseeing Manafort’s case in Washington, D.C., District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, and Manafort’s attorneys would be permitted to view the document in full but the public will not. Earlier this week, Mueller filed a sentencing memo laying out the cooperation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. That document was heavily redacted to conceal information Flynn has provided in the probe and to at least two other matters under investigation by the Justice Department. Glenn Kirschner, a former federal prosecutor with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in D.C., said he expects the public memo on Manafort to include specifics about the defendant’s lies, unless those details touch on subjects central to the Russia investigation. “It may be that we see an equal number of redactions in the Manafort memo,” Kirschner said, comparing it to the Flynn filing. ADVERTISEMENT Still, Friday’s deadline offers Mueller a fresh opportunity to put facts about the Manafort case and the broader investigation into the public realm. While Mueller and his team of prosecutors have refrained from speaking publicly or commenting on developments in their cases, the special counsel has notably put forth detailed court filings that illuminate an investigation that has captured intense public interest. “The prosecutor has an awful lot of discretion,” Honig said. “It could be a very terse, one- or two-page conclusory statement, or it could be a narrative-style submission.” It remains unclear exactly what Manafort lied about. He was initially ensnared in the Russia investigation on charges related to his foreign lobbying for a pro-Russia political party in Ukraine. Manafort was viewed as a key cooperator with U.S. government investigators because of his visibility into the Trump campaign and information he could offer in related foreign lobbying investigations. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Manafort allegedly misled investigators about his lobbying work and contacts with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian who worked for the offshoot of Manafort’s firm in Ukraine. Kilimnik, suspected of ties to Russian intelligence, was charged alongside Manafort with witness tampering earlier this year but has remained out of the reach of U.S. prosecutors. Mueller first revealed last week that Manafort allegedly lied to the special counsel’s office and other FBI investigators “on a variety of subject matters,” noting that a forthcoming submission would explain “the nature of the defendant’s crimes and lies, including those after signing the plea agreement herein.” Manafort has denied that he misled investigators in breach of his plea agreement. Mueller’s disclosure came days after Trump submitted written answers to the special counsel’s questions about collusion, raising questions among some legal experts about the timing of the two developments. If prosecutors accuse Manafort of lying about something that Trump has said publicly, it could signal the president also lied in his written answers to Mueller, according to former federal prosecutor Shanlon Wu. Wu said that the Manafort memo, in addition to testimony from Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, could be very dangerous for the president if they contradict the written answers Trump provided on Nov. 20. Cohen has pleaded guilty to several federal crimes in New York and formally agreed last week to cooperate with Mueller, reportedly sitting for interviews with the special counsel’s office that have totaled 70 hours. Legal experts say it’s possible Manafort lied about others in the campaign who have had contact with Russian officials, but they noted it’s unlikely any of those names would be revealed in Friday’s memo. “If he’s disclosing information about somebody who ultimately won’t be prosecuted because Mueller has fallen out of bed with Manafort, there’s more reason to be less clear about it,” said Joel Cohen, a white collar defense attorney and former federal and state prosecutor. “It’s unfair to identify someone as having done wrong if they won’t ultimately be prosecuted for it.” If Manafort lied by omission, that would suggest he might be trying to protect individuals or avoid retribution from someone. “I’ve dealt with dozens of cooperators in my time as a prosecutor, and the reason they go off the rails, as it appears Manafort has, is they are omitting — they are protecting themselves or others,” said Honig. “I think it’s likely that Manafort withheld info from Mueller here. The question, then, is going to be what information was he holding back, who was he protecting, and why?” Berman Jackson, an Obama appointee, is giving Manafort’s defense team until Wednesday to file a preliminary response to the prosecution’s report. Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing, said in court last week that he might request further investigation to prove Mueller’s allegations that his client lied to the FBI. While Berman Jackson set March 5 as Manafort’s target sentencing date, she said she will hold a hearing in mid- to late January to determine whether Manafort breached his plea deal. As part of the deal, Manafort had agreed to plead guilty to two felony charges — conspiracy against the U.S. and conspiracy to launder money — and fully cooperate with Mueller’s probe. In return, prosecutors agreed to drop five other charges, including failure to register as a foreign lobbyists, making false statements and tampering with witnesses. But prosecutors said in court last week they are considering bringing new charges against Manafort for lying to the FBI in breach of the agreement. Even if he’s not charged, Joel Cohen said the judge can choose to give Manafort more time if it turns out he sent Mueller on a wild goose chase. The Manafort filing is one of several Mueller will file this week in his sprawling Russia investigation. The special counsel is also slated to submit details Friday on Michael Cohen’s cooperation ahead of his sentencing on eight federal charges in New York. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Ken Dilanian WASHINGTON — Three new court documents are scheduled to emerge Friday that could shed new light on what Donald Trump's former top aides have been telling — or not telling — federal investigators. A federal judge in New York has ordered that prosecutors for the Southern District of New York and the Special Counsel's Office have until 5 p.m. Friday to deliver sentencing memos designed to detail former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's cooperation in their ongoing investigations. And special counsel Robert Mueller is also due to file a document spelling out what his team previously referred to as the \\"crimes and lies\\" that led them to cancel a cooperation agreement with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Legal experts say it's likely that both documents will contain sections that are blacked out, as was the case with the sentencing memo Mueller filed Tuesday in the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The theory that Mueller would use these documents to inform the public about the progress of his ongoing investigation into Russian election interference and related matters did not pan out in the case of the Flynn memo. Key sections of that memo were redacted, including crucial questions about what Trump knew and when about Flynn's lies to the FBI — and a whole page describing a separate criminal investigation. Mueller's decision to withhold that information shows, some experts say, that the former FBI director does not feel that his investigation is at risk of being derailed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, who had expressed open hostility toward it before his appointment. \\"He disclosed so little in the Flynn memo that it led me to conclude two things,\\" said former federal prosecutor Glenn Kirschner, an NBC News legal analyst. \\"One, he doesn't have a sense of urgency, and two, he probably has a lot more investigating to do. If he was ready to show his cards, he wouldn't have redacted all this stuff.\\" Former federal prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg says there may be something else at play: \\"As usual, Mueller may be thinking two steps ahead of the rest of us.\\" Zeidenberg noted that Trump has not tweeted or uttered a word about Flynn since the sentencing memo on Flynn was filed, in contrast to Trump's immediate attack on Cohen after Cohen pleaded guilty last week to lying about a Trump Tower project in Moscow. \\"Trump's been quite quiet since that filing,\\" Zeidenberg said. \\"He hasn't attacked Flynn. If those blanks had been filled in, Trump's head would have exploded — he'd be going crazy.\\" \\"If Mueller waits and does his big reveal all at once, everything's done. It's too late\\" for Trump to engineer his firing, Zeidenberg said. \\"If he were to have revealed everything on those redactions now, it could jeopardize ongoing matters, and it wouldn't have been smart politically for his continued survival. I think it probably makes a lot of sense. Trump doesn't want to attack Flynn because he doesn't know whether Flynn is coming at him.\\" As for the Southern District’s sentencing memo for Cohen, he is also cooperating in separate ongoing investigations that district prosecutors would likely want to keep secret, so that document may also be redacted. Chuck Rosenberg, a former federal prosecutor and NBC News legal analyst who once worked with Mueller, said Mueller — a by-the-book former Marine combat leader — likely never considered making public anything to do with ongoing criminal matters. The rule of thumb, he said, is \\"if it's public it won't be sensitive and if it's sensitive it won't be public.\\" Rosenberg believes Friday's filings will be \\"mildly interesting,\\" in that they may further describe in general terms how helpful prosecutors believe Cohen to have been, and also what sort of lies they allege Manafort told that blew up his plea deal. But if Manafort's lies were about Trump and Russian election interference, Rosenberg said, \\"We won't see them.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"Special Counsel Robert Mueller is moving towards further indictments, with mounting evidence suggesting a flurry of activity by year-end.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Saint Francis River is a tributary of the Mississippi River , about 426 miles ( 686 km ) long , in southeastern Missouri and northeastern Arkansas in the United States . The river drains a mostly rural area and forms part of the Missouri - Arkansas state line along the western side of the Missouri Bootheel . - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba. - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation. - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period. It once reached elevations similar to those of the Alps and the Rocky Mountains before naturally occurring erosion. The Appalachian chain is a barrier to east-west travel, as it forms a series of alternating ridgelines and valleys oriented in opposition to most roads running east or west. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - The Missouri River is the longest river in North America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi-arid watershed of more than half a million square miles (1,300,000 km), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system.

Step 3: Evaluate the provided options (A) more smooth and (B) less smooth. Step 4: Consider the context of bowling. Bowling lanes are specifically designed for bowling balls to roll smoothly to the pins. Bowling floors, on the other hand, refer to the general flooring in a bowling alley not designed for the balls' movement. Based on these steps, the most sensical answer is that the \\"bowling lane\\" is smoother than the \\"bowling floor\\" because it's the surface specifically designed for this purpose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The moment I saw that guinea pig's corpse, I made up my mind. I would not tell my son Checkers was dead ... at least not that night. Drew had five tests within the next two days. I wasn't going to let grief jeopardize his grades. Checkers, on the left, enjoys a bit of kale with Andrea. I realize instantly the challenges of my decision. How could I keep this secret in a 10-by-12 room in which the guinea pig chalet was almost as big as the twin bed? I'd already goofed by yelping, \\"Oh, my!\\" when I saw the body. Drew heard me from his bathroom. \\"What's wrong, Mommy? Are you OK?\\" In what seemed like one move, I reach in the closet, dump shoes out of a box, grab","completion":"a blanket to cover the guinea pig's body, and respond reassuringly, \\"Everything's fine, sweetie! I just dropped a shoe.\\" Drew, not sensing anything amiss, returns to his bathroom routine. My heart is pounding as I carefully pick up Checkers, place him in the box, and gently wrap the blanket around him. I put the box on the top shelf of the closet, hoping to buy some time. In that moment, I know I have to tread carefully. The essence of my plan is to keep Drew focused on his studies and not let the sad news of Checkers' passing interfere. Each step of my plan is designed to minimize suspicion and maintain normalcy. First, I decide not to mention anything about Checkers until after Drew's tests are over. Second, to avoid raising suspicion, I silently clean the guinea pig's chalet, removing any traces that might hint at Checkers' demise. I then replace the chalet with some of Drew's favorite books, thinking this will help keep his attention on his studies. Over the next few days, I try to stay positive and engage with Drew, asking about his classes, tests, and interests. Whenever he mentions Checkers, I am careful to respond with vague but reassuring statements like \\"Checkers is resting\\" or \\"He's been very quiet lately.\\" Finally, after Drew's tests are over, I gather my courage and break the news about Checkers. I explain that I hid the truth to ensure he could focus on his schoolwork. I brace for his reaction, unsure how he will take this revelation. Although hurt by the deception, Drew comes to understand my intentions, and we mourn Checkers together. There will always be challenges in parenting, and the line between protecting and deceiving can be blurry. I know that my choice may not have been perfect, but I made it out of love and with my son's best interests in mind."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I can't eat much beef anymore compared to pork, because the A. beef is smooth for my stomach.; B. pork is smooth for my stomach.;","completion":"B. pork is smooth for my stomach. Ever since I realized that beef had started causing me digestive problems, I started relying on the smooth and tender pork to satiate my meat cravings. This gradual shift in my dietary habits had changed my life for the better. My stomach felt lighter, and my overall well-being improved significantly. When it comes to pork, it's not just the taste and texture that sets it apart from beef. The secret lies in the different ways it can be prepared, as there is much more variety and versatility to pork than beef. As a protein-rich source, pork can be enjoyed in numerous forms, be it juicy pork chops, succulent pulled pork, or crisp bacon. Furthermore, the adventure doesn't end there - pork can be marinated, grilled, roasted, slow-cooked, and even incorporated into various stews and casseroles. This array of culinary possibilities makes pork a top choice for meat enthusiasts who crave some variation in their meals. One of the primary reasons pork is smooth for my stomach compared to beef is because of the differences in fat content. Generally speaking, pork is leaner than beef, with less marbling and lower concentrations of saturated fat. This renders pork as a healthier alternative to beef, ultimately preventing digestive discomfort associated with consuming large quantities of fatty meats. In addition, pork's high-quality protein helps build and maintain muscle mass, while it is also a source of essential vitamins and minerals, such as thiamin, niacin, riboflavin, and phosphorus, all of which contribute to a healthy body. However, shifting from beef to pork doesn't mean that I had to sacrifice taste. The innate flavor profile of pork is another aspect that garnered my admiration for it. The natural sweetness and tenderness in pork dishes can outdo even the finest cuts of beef. Pairing pork with complementary sauces and spices, like apple and sage or honey and mustard, further enhances its taste and creates an unforgettable experience for the palate. Additionally, I found that exploring different cuts of pork allowed me to discover mouthwatering dishes that were relatively easier on the stomach. For instance, tenderloin, the leanest cut, is an excellent choice if you're looking for a light, stomach-friendly meal. Moreover, the shoulder and belly offer tender meat and distinct flavours that don't overwhelm the digestive system. By opting for these cuts, I could still indulge in hearty pork meals without subjecting my stomach to any distress. In conclusion, the shift from beef to pork was a necessary change for the sake of my health and digestion. The smooth texture of pork, its versatility in preparation, and the unique flavour combinations that can be achieved, all make it an outstanding choice for meat-lovers. And most importantly, it has been a gentle and nourishing choice for my stomach, which has led to a more comfortable and enjoyable dining experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Serenity gave way to tragedy when Zane Zaminski, the astrophysicist who'd recently taken up residence among the indigenous people, was found dead. It was a startling discovery that would soon make headlines around the world, altering the course of humanity's understanding of itself, the universe, and the beings that might dwell just beyond the stars. Not too long before his death, Zane Zaminski had captured the world's attention with a bold and controversial claim. Having spent endless nights gazing skyward, monitoring the vast expanse of the heavens through his telescope, Zane had stumbled upon something - something that placed both his life and his scientific career in dire jeopardy. The renowned astrophysicist had intercepted a broadcast signal, one which he believed originated from an extraterrestrial civilization. He wasted no time sharing the groundbreaking discovery, but his actions would provoke an outpouring of skepticism and condemnation from around the world. When Zane was dismissed from NASA, the news swiftly spread like wildfire, casting doubt on his assertion and reinforcing the belief held by some that the broadcast was nothing more than an elaborate hoax. As Zane's credibility plummeted, the Earth's temperature continued to break records; the scorching heat seemed hellbent on thrusting the planet towards an ecological disaster of unprecedented magnitude. It was around this time that rumors began to swirl about an atomic power plant under construction near the remote Eskimo community where Zane had sought refuge. The complex, located on the outskirts of the village and shrouded in secrecy, appeared to be in the final stages of completion. When news leaked that the plant's control had unexpectedly been handed over to a mysterious group, it became clear to some that its existence was far from a mere coincidence. The group's diverse and impressive roster suggested a connection to the extraterrestrial life Zane had been desperately trying to warn humanity about. Despite the mounting evidence to support Zane's claims and the bizarre circumstances surrounding the power plant, the revelation did little to sway mainstream opinion. As the world moved ahead, the astrophysicist's narrative was left to languish on the fringes. That was, until the unexpected resurfaced in the form of another one of Zane's former coworkers. Recent reports had brought to light the clandestine involvement of one of Zane's most trusted colleagues, who had been clandestinely selling out their research and findings to the FBI for years. This treachery and deceit, finally uncovered, caused many to reevaluate their stance and question whether Zane's claims were not as fantastic as they'd once believed. As the world reeled from the slew of revelations in the wake of Zane's demise, the remote Eskimo community found itself engulfed by never-before-seen attention from investigators, journalists, and conspiracy theorists alike. As the sun set on the frigid landscape, reflecting an unusual warmth upon the snow, the truth began to glimmer and shine like the very stars Zane had watched so intently. And the world was left to ponder one singular, daunting question: what if Zane Zaminski's discoveries had been right all along?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 1: Chemical reactions inside the battery Two different chemical compounds or elements are present in the battery. When connected in a circuit, a chemical reaction takes place between these compounds, leading to a flow of electrons. Step 2: Separation of charges During the chemical reaction, electrons are released and transported from one compound to another. Consequently, a voltage difference (or potential difference) forms between the two terminals of the battery. The negative terminal has an excess of electrons, while the positive terminal has a deficiency of electrons. Step 3: Connecting the battery to a device In order to harness the potential difference generated by the battery, it must be connected to a device via a closed circuit. This can be done by inserting the battery into the device, and ensuring that the positive and negative terminals of the battery are connected to the relevant nodes of the device. Step 4: Creating a continuous flow of electrons (current) When the battery is connected to a device in a closed circuit, the chemical reaction in the battery causes a continuous flow of electrons from the negative terminal to the positive terminal through the device. This flow of electrons is called electric current. Step 5: Converting chemical energy to electrical energy The movement of electrons from one terminal to another constitutes the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy. This electrical energy is then utilized by the device or appliance to power its various functions. Step 6: Depletion of chemical components and end of battery life As electrons continue to flow in the circuit, the chemical components inside the battery gradually deplete, causing the voltage difference between the terminals to decrease. This process eventually leads to the end of the battery's life. When this occurs, the battery can no longer power the device and must be recharged (if rechargeable) or replaced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This article: On June 21, 2005, the day of the release of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page advertisements in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band. \\"For a year now\\", Corgan wrote, \\"I have walked around with a secret, a secret I chose to keep. But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist.

Write a title for this article: Le Studio des Arts Vivants (the living arts studio) is the first multi-discipline art space in Morocco. With the opening of Le Studio des Arts Vivants (the living arts studio), the first multi-discipline art space in Morocco, Casablanca is taking its place at the centre of the countryâs contemporary art scene. Jump in a red taxi and zip through Caza, as the locals call it, and Le Studio des Arts Vivants seems to magically appear, a shock of modern architecture between dusty palm trees. Built last year by Fihr Kettani, a Casablanca native, the aim of the studio is to bring all of the arts together under one roof and create bridges between the different disciplines. Students of all ages are taught music, art, dance and theatre from professionals from around the world and La Galerie 38, the 500m art gallery connected to the studio, supports local artists, like Radia Bent Lhoucine, a self-taught female painter of the 1960s, Edmond Amran El Maleh, a writer and critic, and Fatiha Zemmouri, a painter and sculptor whose work will be shown in December. “We don’t only want to make art, we want to make cultural happenings,” said Mohamed Chaoui, a La Galerie 38 partner. The art scene in Casablanca has been steadily growing since King Mohammed VI, an art enthusiast, began his reign in 1999. Originally focused on Orientalism, the focus then turned to Moroccan artists. La Galerie 38 also strives to display new inspiration from the international art world. In August, they commissioned paintings from famous American street artist Alec Monopoly. His show will be presented this spring. “Art in Morocco is just beginning to change, the state is giving it more importance,” Kettani said. “My goal is to give the country a platform for the detection of new talent. To support this new movement.” In their 600-seat theatre, Le Studio des Arts Vivants has weekly performances and the gallery features new exhibits six times a year. Visit their website and the gallery’s Facebook page for future events.

Irving Grant Thalberg (May 30, 1899 - September 14, 1936) was an American film producer during the early years of motion pictures. He was called \\"The Boy Wonder\\" for his youth and ability to select scripts, choose actors, gather production staff, and make profitable films, including Grand Hotel, China Seas, Camille, Mutiny on the Bounty, and The Good Earth. His films carved out an international market, \\"projecting a seductive image of American life brimming with vitality and rooted in democracy and personal freedom,\\" states biographer Roland Flamini. He found work as an office secretary at Universal Pictures' New York office, and later became personal secretary to the studio's founder and president, Carl Laemmle. Among Thalberg's duties were transcribing and editing notes that Laemmle had written during screenings of his films. He earned 25 weekly, becoming adept at making insightful observations, which impressed Laemmle. Laemmle took Thalberg to see his Los Angeles production facility, where he spent a month watching how movie production worked. Before returning to New York, Laemmle told Thalberg to remain and \\"keep an eye on things for me.\\" Two months later, Laemmle returned to California, partly to see how well Thalberg was able to handle the responsibilities he was given. Thalberg gave him suggestions, which impressed Laemmle by his ability to understand and explain problems. Thalberg suggested, \\"The first thing you should do is establish a new job of studio manager and give him the responsibility of watching day-to-day operations.\\" Laemmle immediately agreed, \\"All right. You're it.\\" In shock, Thalberg replied, \\"I'm what?\\" Laemmle told him to take charge of the Los Angeles studio, which he did in early 1919. At age 20, Thalberg became responsible for immediately overseeing the nine ongoing film productions and nearly thirty scenarios then under development. In describing the rationale for this early appointment as studio manager, film historian David Thomson writes that his new job \\"owed nothing to nepotism, private wealth, or experience in the film industry.\\" He reasons that despite \\"Thalberg's youth, modest education, and frail appearance . . . it is clear that he had the charm, insight, and ability, or the appearance of it, to captivate the film world.\\" Thalberg was one among the majority of Hollywood film industry workers who migrated from the East Coast, primarily from New York. Some film actors, such as Conrad Nagel, did not like the 5-day train trip or the sudden warmth of the California climate. Neither did Marion Davies, who was not used to such \\"big wide spaces.\\" Samuel Marx, a close friend of Thalberg's from New York, recalled how easily Thalberg adapted to Southern California, often standing outside his doorway during moments of contemplation to enjoy the scenery. \\"We were all young,\\" said comedian Buster Keaton. \\"The air in California was like wine. Our business was also young--and growing like nothing ever seen before.\\" What else did he do?","completion":"Irving Thalberg continued to make significant contributions to the film industry throughout his career. Here are some additional accomplishments: 1. In 1924, Thalberg joined newly-formed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) after leaving Universal Pictures. At MGM, he worked with Louis B. Mayer as the head of production. Thalberg's outstanding ability to manage and develop films helped MGM become one of the most successful studios during the golden era of Hollywood. 2. Thalberg introduced the concept of the \\"Thalberg Awards,\\" which were given to filmmakers with outstanding records in making high-quality films. The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, named in his honor, is still awarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for \\"creative producers, whose bodies of work reflect a consistently high quality of motion picture production.\\" 3. Thalberg was known for focusing on the story and script when creating films. He was a firm believer in the importance of a good story, which was essential to the success of a film. He worked with some of the best screenwriters of his time and also developed what became known as the \\"Thalberg Method,\\" a systematic approach to script development involving continuous rewrites and re-shoots to ensure the story reached its full potential. 4. Thalberg played an essential role in shaping the careers of some of the most iconic actors and actresses of his time, such as Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, and Clark Gable. He was known to be a keen talent-spotter and helped launch and sustain the careers of many film industry legends. 5. Thalberg was an innovator in film marketing and promotion, understanding the importance of building a recognizable brand for the studio, the stars, and the films themselves. He oversaw the creation of numerous ad campaigns and refined PR strategies to create anticipation and excitement around the movies his studio produced. In summary, Irving Thalberg remains an influential figure in the history of cinema. His legacy as a film producer who was responsible for numerous classic films, his innovations in film production, and his emphasis on the importance of storytelling have left an indelible mark on the film industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin.

The provided answer does not specifically address which parts of Detroit are densely populated. Instead, it provides general population figures for the whole city. To answer the question, we need to discuss specific neighborhoods or areas known for their high population density. A more appropriate answer to the question: As a former automobile manufacturing hub, Detroit has a diverse population distributed across the city. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, Detroit had a population of around 713,777 people. While the city's population has since declined, some neighborhoods are still densely populated, especially in and around the downtown area and certain suburban neighborhoods. 1. Downtown Detroit: The downtown area is the central business district and the most densely populated part of the city. It includes many high-rise residential apartments and condominiums, as well as hotels for transient populations. 2. Midtown: Located just north of downtown, Midtown is a vibrant cultural center with the Wayne State University, the Detroit Medical Center, and a variety of cultural institutions. The area is densely populated due to a growing student population and people working in the healthcare and education sectors. 3. Mexicantown: In the southwestern part of Detroit, Mexicantown is a diverse and densely populated neighborhood predominantly consisting of Mexican-American residents. The area is known for its vibrant culture, authentic restaurants, and colorful murals. 4. Woodbridge: Woodbridge is a historic district located west of Wayne State University. Its dense population comprises students, young professionals, and families in historic homes, apartment complexes, and newer housing developments. 5. Corktown: Home to some of the city's oldest surviving buildings, Corktown is a vibrant neighborhood that has experienced significant growth in recent years. As Detroit's oldest surviving neighborhood, its dense population is a mix of young professionals, artists, and long-time residents. 6. East English Village: Located in the northeastern part of Detroit, East English Village is a diverse community with densely populated streets, primarily due to the numerous single-family homes and apartment complexes. 7. Palmer Park: Positioned between the two major thoroughfares of Woodward Avenue and Livernois Avenue, Palmer Park is a densely populated mixed-use neighborhood. The area is known for its historic apartment buildings and the picturesque public park that shares its name. These are some examples of densely populated parts of Detroit, but it is essential to note that population levels may vary within a specific area.

The razor of Carrie is much duller than Patricia's because Choose from: a. Carrie bought it new yesterday.. b. Patricia bought it new yesterday..","completion":"Patricia bought it new yesterday. The razor of Carrie is much duller than Patricia's because Patricia bought it new yesterday. This difference in sharpness between the two razors can be attributed to several factors related to the timing and usage of the razors. Considering that a razor's primary purpose is to provide the user with a clean and close shave, having a sharp blade is essential for achieving the best possible results. In this particular scenario, Patricia's razor is superior due to its recent purchase, contributing to its enhanced sharpness and effectiveness in comparison to Carrie's older, duller razor. When a razor is used consistently, its sharpness inevitably decreases over time. This occurs because the blade's cutting edge wears down as it comes into contact with hair and skin, causing it to become dull and less effective. In some cases, improper care and maintenance of the razor may also speed up the dulling process. For instance, failing to properly clean the blade following use, or storing it in a humid or damp environment, can lead to accelerated degradation of the blade's sharpness. In contrast, newly purchased razors come equipped with fresh blades that have yet to experience any wear and tear. As a result, their initial sharpness is typically at its peak, allowing for smoother and more efficient shaving experiences. Given that Patricia bought her razor new yesterday, it stands to reason that its cutting edge is in pristine condition, enabling her to enjoy the benefits of superior sharpness compared to Carrie's older, more worn blade. Furthermore, the type of razor, its quality, and the brand reputation can all have an impact on the blade's longevity and ability to maintain its sharpness. If Patricia opted for a premium, high-quality razor from a reputable manufacturer, it's likely that her razor is designed to retain its sharpness for a longer period of time than a cheaper or less reliable model. This would further contribute to the stark contrast in sharpness between Patricia's and Carrie's razors. In conclusion, Carrie's razor is much duller than Patricia's because Patricia bought it new yesterday, ensuring a fresh blade and optimal sharpness. The factors discussed, such as the decline in blade sharpness over time due to usage and potential differences in razor quality, all contribute to the reasons why Patricia's razor outperforms Carrie's in this situation. By recognizing the value of investing in a high-quality, sharp razor, individuals like Patricia can greatly improve their shaving experiences and achieve the close, comfortable shave they desire."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. and the situation: Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products.

Stolen French technique potters helped firm revolutionise British industry. Article:","completion":"Title: The Two-century-old Secret of Royal Worcester: How a Stolen French Technique Revolutionized British Pottery Introduction: The Royal Worcester Porcelain company, occupying a significant place in British pottery history, mysteriously held the key to how it produced its wares for over two centuries. At last, the enigmatic secret has been revealed thanks to an overlooked diary, which not only exposes a stolen French technique but also spotlights the captivating story of John Flight, a young entrepreneur, who made it possible. Unraveling the Secrets of John Flight’s Diary: The Royal Worcester Porcelain Company boasts a rich history, dating back to 1751. Though it is well known for its elegant and exquisite designs, its techniques and processes have been carefully hidden, making them a matter of speculation among historians and collectors all these years. However, the recent discovery of a diary belonging to John Flight, the first generation director of the Royal Worcester, has brought many secrets out into the open. This diary, diligently maintained by Flight for six years until his untimely death at the age of 25 in 1791, reveals intricated details of the manufacturing techniques of the Royal Worcester. Among these pages, historians have found tangible evidence that Flight cunningly stole a French pottery technique and capitalized on it to revolutionize British pottery, establishing his company as a powerhouse in the process. Infiltration and Acquisition of the Coveted French Technique: For decades, continental potteries, particularly French ones, held a significant advantage over their British counterparts. Their distinctive, decorative styles, and superior manufacturing techniques enabled them to produce delicate and high-end ceramics. It was this superiority that ignited a desire in John Flight to even the playing field and excel in the industry. Flight hired skilled French potters, who were intrigued by the promise of new opportunities in England. Upon their arrival, these potters soon became the backbone of his operation as they brought with them the savoir-faire that had been missing from his workforce. These potters played a crucial role in incorporating French pottery manufacturing methods within the Royal Worcester, ultimately revolutionizing the British pottery market. Implications for the British Pottery Industry: With Flight's astute leadership and the French potters' expertise, the Royal Worcester introduced a range of products reflecting the finesse and superiority of their continental counterparts. As a result, the company became a turning point for British ceramics, elevating the quality of local pottery to an international level and solidifying Royal Worcester's name in the annals of British industry. This was not just a victory for Flight's company; it had a far-reaching impact on the British pottery industry as a whole. As Royal Worcester ceramics gained popularity in the market, rival companies began to emulate their style and techniques. This led to a marked improvement in the overall standard, turning the British ceramics market into a force to be reckoned with on the global stage. Concluding Thoughts: The unearthing of John Flight's diary offers a rare glimpse into the strategic moves behind transforming a family-owned pottery business into a world-renowned brand. His determination to distill the essence of French expertise, his instrumental role in the lives of talented French potters seeking opportunity, and his untimely death at the tender age of 25 all combine into a thrilling narrative of Britain's industrial past. Further, the revelation of how a stolen technique revolutionized the British pottery landscape serves as a testament to Flight's ingenuity and the influence of French craftsmanship in shaping the industry's future. This crucial discovery places Royal Worcester at the very heart of Britain's pottery success story, ensuring that the mystique surrounding this iconic brand's enduring legacy will continue to captivate generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

American tourist snaps Italian statue’s finger off Aug. 6, 2013 at 6:31 PM ET Violating the first rule of visiting a museum — look but don’t touch the art — an American tourist in Italy has generated shock and outrage by snapping the finger off a 600-year-old statue at a museum in Florence. According to the Italian newspaper, Corriere Fiorentino, the snap heard around the art world took place when an unnamed 55-year-old Missouri man visiting the city’s Museo dell'Opera del Duomo held his hand up against the outstretched palm of a statue of the Virgin Mary by the 15th-century sculptor Giovanni d'Ambrogio. Whether he was comparing hand spans or giving the statue a high five is unclear but the end result was that the pinky finger of the statue’s right hand was broken off. Despite apologizing for his action, the tourist could be liable for a large fine, according to The (UK) Independent. MAURIZIO DEGL' INNOCENTI / EPA Even a financial penalty, however, is unlikely to assuage local Florentines, experienced art lovers and other travelers who would argue that anyone with the means to travel should also possess the understanding that art in museums is meant to be seen and not touched. “In a globalized world like ours, the fundamental rules for visiting a museum have been forgotten, that is, ‘Do not touch the works’,” museum director Timothy Verdun told reporters. That basic premise notwithstanding, that globalization only reinforces the need for continuing education, says Sevil Sonmez, a tourism professor at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. “If this was a first-time traveler, he’s probably not very experienced, maybe a little naïve,” said Sonmez. “If there’s no one around to give pointers on what to do and what to avoid, these things are likely to happen.” In fact, in the case of the Virgin’s dismembered digit, it’s happened before. As reported by Firenze Today, the pinky was actually a plaster replacement for the long-missing marble original. Nor is this first priceless piece of art damaged by accident. In 2006, a visitor to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, England, tripped and sent three Quing Dynasty vases crashing to the ground. Four years later, a woman visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York fell into a Picasso painting called “The Actor” and left it with a six-inch gash. The artworks above, it’s worth noting, were eventually repaired and put back on display, which suggests there may be hope that future visitors to the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo will be able to view the Virgin with all 10 of her fingers. In the meantime, the incident in Florence should serve as a timely reminder of the “look but don’t touch” rule. That also means no high fives, no “pull my finger” photo ops and definitely no fist bumps. As for the still-anonymous yet now-infamous finger-snapper, Sonmez, for one, takes the long view. “It’s part of the process of traveling and gaining experience,” she said. “The best way to learn is to make mistakes — and he certainly won’t do that again.” Rob Lovitt is a longtime travel writer who still believes the journey is as important as the destination. Follow him on Twitter. ||||| The unnamed man was reportedly spotted by a security guard as he began touching the statue and trying to measure its finger, but attempts to stop him came too late and the digit broke off. The incident took place in the Italian city’s world famous Museo dell’Opera del Duomo, with the 600-year-old exhibit believed to be the work of eminent medieval sculptor Giovanni d'Ambrogio. The tourist is said to have apologised for damaging the priceless artwork, but could still receive a large fine for his careless behaviour. Before any financial penalty can be arranged, however, the American tourist has suffered the full force of Florentine fury over the incident, which locals consider symptomatic of a modern thoughtless and disrespectful attitude towards fragile ancient artworks. Timothy Verdun, the head of the museum and coincidentally an American himself, condemned the tourist’s behaviour, saying: “In a globalized world like ours, the fundamental rules for visiting a museum have been forgotten, that is, ‘Do not touch the works’”. Mr Verdun confirmed that the broken finger was not original to the piece, and had been added at a later date. He added that the price of any repair was not yet known and that, even if it was considered affordable, there was no guarantee that the restoration would be a success. |||||","completion":"An American tourist generated shock and outrage when they accidentally broke the finger off a 600-year-old statue at the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence, Italy.

Let's do it together: First, we want to get rid of the +6 on the right side of the equals sign. To do this, we subtract 6 from both sides of the equation. -50 - 6 = -8*i + 6 - 6 Now, we can simplify the left side: -56 = -8*i Next, we want to find out what \\"i\\" is, so we need to get rid of the -8 that's multiplying \\"i\\". To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -8. -56 / -8 = (-8*i) / -8 Now, we can simplify the left side: 7 = i So, the number \\"i\\" should be 7 to make this math problem true.

If \\"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip.\\", does it follow that \\"Andrea could see the landing strip.\\"","completion":"Yes, it follows that \\"Andrea could see the landing strip.\\" Let's analyze it step by step. 1) The sentence \\"As Andrea in the crop duster passed over Susan, she could see the landing strip.\\" has two primary subjects - Andrea and Susan. 2) However, the pronoun \\"she\\" mentioned later in the sentence normally refers to the subject nearest to it. In this case, it's Andrea. Since Andrea is closer to the pronoun \\"she\\", we can safely conclude that \\"she\\" refers to Andrea. 3) Therefore, considering \\"she\\" as referring to Andrea, the statement implies that as Andrea passed over Susan in the crop duster, Andrea (she) could see the landing strip.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How did the Hellenistic period of colonization differ from earlier periods of conquest\\" is in \\"After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum.

After meeting fisheries leaders several times since last summer, utility officials believed they had won approval from a prefectural fisheries federation for a plan to reduce the amount of contaminated water at the stricken Fukushima No. 1 nuclear plant. However, the fishermen themselves lashed out against TEPCO at a meeting in Iwaki, Fukushima Prefecture, on May 13. “An explanation from TEPCO alone will not be enough to win the confidence of union members,” a participant at the meeting said. TEPCO officials emphasized the safety of its plan to pump up groundwater at the plant and release it into the ocean before it can flow into the basements of reactor and turbine buildings and mix with highly radioactive water accumulated there. Some leaders of the Fukushima Prefectural Federation of Fisheries Co-operative Associations had agreed with TEPCO’s plan. However, opposition from rank-and-file members was so great that the federation ended up rejecting TEPCO plan. Some members said that any water from the plant dumped into the sea would spread fears about the safety of their catches. Officials of the Fukushima prefectural government and the central government’s Fisheries Agency also attended the meeting. Fishermen in the Tohoku region, especially Fukushima Prefecture, have been trying to regain a sense of normalcy in their operations since the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011, led to the triple meltdown at the plant. Weeks after the accident, the utility announced that highly radioactive water had leaked from the reactor buildings into the sea, contaminating the sea bed and fish. The company also released several thousand tons of contaminated water into the ocean in the early stages of the crisis. Fukushima Prefecture has been fighting an uphill battle to convince the public that its products are safe from radiation contamination. However, every report about water leaking or being released from the nuclear plant fuels fears of radiation and raises alarm among the local fishermen. In the northern part of Fukushima Prefecture, where the contamination of seafood has been lower than in other areas, the Soma-Futaba fishermen’s union is preparing for full-fledged operations. Since last June, the union has been distributing its catch based on trial operations. The types of marine products union members now catch have expanded to 16, and distribution has branched out to more markets. The Iwaki fishermen’s union is also preparing to resume operations on a trial basis. But the Soma-Futaba union considered suspending its trial operations after radioactive water stored in underground tanks at the nuclear plant was found to have leaked into the ground in April. Distributors called the Soma-Futaba union to ask if its marine products were safe for sale. “If something happens at the plant, it will directly hit the image of local products,” said an official with a local marine food processor. One senior union member who attended the May 13 meeting said the leaks reported in April “heightened anxiety among fishermen and their distrust of TEPCO.” The leaks have also compounded the difficulties in storing water used to cool the melted and spent fuel at the plant. The lack of storage space is hindering the company’s overall plan to decommission the reactors. Of the estimated 380,000 tons of contaminated water on the complex, 290,000 tons are stored in tanks and other facilities. About 400 tons of groundwater flows in daily through cracks in the reactor and turbine buildings apparently caused by the March 11 earthquake. TEPCO plans to reduce the flow to 300 tons by diverting the water to the sea. Describing the May 13 meeting as “extremely important,” TEPCO officials sought to win consent by showing the results of a study by the company and a third party on the quality of the groundwater. Radioactive levels of groundwater at the plant were 0.02 to 0.18 becquerel per liter, compared with 1 to 2 becquerels per liter detected in rivers near the plant, TEPCO said. Although the federation opposes the release of contaminated water, it was initially inclined to accept the utility’s plan for the groundwater. “(The federation) would be better off letting it happen because TEPCO will have no choice but to release contaminated water into the sea if its system to handle radioactive water falls apart,” a federation official said. The utility had assumed the federation would cooperate with the plan and was prepared to start releasing the groundwater into the sea the day after the meeting. However, one union leader said before the meeting that most members at his union were opposed to the plan. Tetsu Nozaki, who heads the federation, acknowledged after the meeting that a consensus was reached at the federation’s top level, but not among individual members. “Even if it is groundwater, damage to the public perception of fishing will be unavoidable and could hurt our trial operations,” a member said. One union leader noted that there was confusion among fishermen about the water to be released under TEPCO’s plan. “Many of our members got a wrong idea that contaminated water would be dumped into the sea after being treated,” the leader said at the meeting. “If that is the case, then it will be impossible for consumers to understand (the difference between groundwater and treated water).” Although surprised at the outcome of the meeting, TEPCO officials acknowledged that past talks with federation officials alone have proved insufficient to win the backing of local fishermen. “We should start all over,” a TEPCO official said. Federation officials are trying to reduce distrust of TEPCO by holding briefings where the utility and the central government can explain the water-release plan to individual fishermen. The presence of government officials is expected to emphasize that TEPCO’s plan is safe and in line with the central government’s policy. Tsunemasa Niitsuma, managing executive officer with TEPCO, said after the May 13 meeting that the company has yet to gain the full trust of Fukushima fishermen. “It is important for us to proceed to the next step after gaining their firm understanding,” he said. The utility intends to complete the briefing rounds for union members in about a month. The federation comprises six unions, with a total of 1,499 members. |||||Summary:","completion":"Tokyo Electric Power Co.

While there were no pitched battles, there was repression and death: all political parties were abolished, as were all labor unions and Galician nationalist organizations as the Seminario de Estudos Galegos. Galicia's statute of autonomy was annulled (as were those of Catalonia and the Basque provinces once those were conquered).

A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells.

Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly. Pete's vocabulary did not include the word shithead either in its singular or plural. \\"Pete, they're all like that. Alcohol is bad medicine. That's why places like ours are in business. To make them calcitrant.\\" \\"I know that.\\" Pete sounded a little annoyed. There was some commotion in the background, a knocking on doors.

A strong woman oriented subject after long, director Krishna Vamsi's Shakti- The Power, the Desi version of the Hollywood hit Not Without My Daughter is actress Sridevi's first home-production. A story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice. The story of the film revolves around Nandini (Karisma Kapoor) who lives in Canada with her two uncles (Tiku Talsania, Jaspal Bhatti). There she meets Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), falls in love with him and they soon marry. Their family is complete when Nandini has a boy, Raja (Master Jai Gidwani). But their happiness is short lived, as the news of Shekhar's ailing mother (Deepti Naval)makes them leave their perfect life in Canada and come to India. And that's when the problems start. From the moment they reach India, both are shocked to see the pollution and the vast throngs of people everywhere. They take a crowded train to reach Shekhar's village and when they finally reach the station, they have to catch a long bus drive to his village. The filthy sweaty bus combined with the uncertain terrain makes it a never-ending drive. And unfortunately for them, a frenzied mob that beat Shekhar out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus. Fortunately, they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him. After that, they drive to the handing Havel where Shekhar''s father, Narsimha (Nana Patekar) lives with his wife (Deepti Naval). Nandani realized that her father-in-law is in command as soon as she enters the place, but her only solace is her mother-in-law's warm welcome. Living there, Nandini learns of her father-in-laws tyrannical behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him. The day she sees her father-in-law teach her son to throw a bomb, she loses it and lashes out against him, insisting to Shekhar that they move back to Canada. But terror strikes again when Shekhar is murdered one day, leaving a broken down Nandini alone with her son in this strange land where she is harrowed by a cruel father-in-law. Her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart-wrenching film. What sets apart Shakti from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie. The only drawback is Ismail Darbar''s music, which fails to rise above the script. The only saving grace is the sexy item number Ishq Kameena, which has been composed by Anu Malik. Another pat for the director comes because he has extracted some splendid performances from his cast. Karisma Kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother. She is sure to win awards for this heated portrayal. Second is actor Nana Patekar who is back with a bang with this film. His uncouth mannerisms suit him to the hilt and he's shown his versatility once again with this role. Sanjay Kapoor is the surprise packet of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors. Deepti Naval too is in top form and her Pr-climax showdown with Nana is praiseworthy. Shahrukh's cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value. Though his role was not really required, he's done it well. Overall, Shakti is a far superior film than most churned out these days and the Pr-release hype is sure to get it a good opening. Shakti is sure to get the critics and audience thumps up. So what if the film needs to be desperately trimmed by at least 2 reels to better the impact.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What rank was the composer who composed a piece for the Paris Opera in the 1970s promoted to in 1987? ? Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in...

Please answer this question: who were the prime ministers of canada during the great depression?","completion":"During the Great Depression, which took place from 1929 to the late 1930s, Canada had two prime ministers who served at various points during this period. Both leaders grappled with the severe economic challenges that the Great Depression brought to the country. 1. Richard Bedford Bennett (1930-1935): Born on July 3, 1870, in Hopewell, Nova Scotia, Richard Bedford Bennett was the 11th Prime Minister of Canada. He held the position from August 7, 1930, to October 23, 1935, serving under the Conservative Party banner. Bennett's tenure fell at the beginning and peak of the Great Depression, which hit Canada significantly due to its dependence on raw material and agricultural exports that experienced steep declines in global demand and prices. Bennett initially believed in classical economic theory, which prescribed minimal government intervention during economic crises. Consequently, he hesitated to adopt more expansive policies at the start of his term. As unemployment skyrocketed and the Depression's severity deepened, public pressure and frustration grew, prompting Bennett to change his approach. In 1935, Bennett introduced a series of reform initiatives, collectively known as the \\"Bennett New Deal.\\" These policies included the introduction of unemployment insurance, a progressive income tax system, minimum wages, limits on work hours, and regulations governing working conditions. However, Bennett's New Deal was perceived as too little, too late by many Canadians. The discontent led to the Conservative Party's defeat in the 1935 general election, and Bennett was replaced by the Liberal Party leader, William Lyon Mackenzie King. 2. William Lyon Mackenzie King (1921-1926, 1926-1930, 1935-1948): Born in Berlin (now Kitchener), Ontario, on December 17, 1874, William Lyon Mackenzie King was the 10th and longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history. King served as Prime Minister in three non-consecutive terms: from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. As a result, he led the nation both before and during the Great Depression, serving under the Liberal Party. King was the Prime Minister at the onset of the Great Depression but lost the 1930 election to R.B. Bennett, partly due to Canada's worsening economic conditions. Despite being in opposition during Bennett's term, King continued to maintain a high level of political engagement and remained a prominent figure in Canadian politics. Upon returning to power in 1935, King took a more active approach to mitigating the impacts of the Depression. Under his leadership, the Canadian government implemented various relief programs and employment initiatives, such as public works projects and the establishment of the Bank of Canada in 1935. Unlike Bennett, who was seen as out of touch with the population's needs, King was better at reading the public sentiment and was empathetic toward the difficulties faced by ordinary Canadians during the Great Depression. Throughout his tenure, King maintained a close relationship with the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was concurrently executing the \\"New Deal\\" policies to combat the Depression in the United States. Both leaders engaged in collaborative efforts to revive their respective nations' economies and alleviate the hardship faced by their citizens. In summary, Richard Bedford Bennett and William Lyon Mackenzie King were the two Prime Ministers of Canada during the Great Depression. While Bennett struggled with the crisis and saw his popularity plummet due to his initial reluctance to enact comprehensive reforms, King was able to regain public support and navigate the country through the latter half of the Depression with a more proactive approach to economic recovery and social welfare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese tea has a history of more than 5,000 years. It was most popular during the Tang Dynasty. China has many kinds of tea. White, yellow, green, oolong , black and dark tea are the six main kinds. People in different places drink tea in their own way. People in Guangdong and Fujian love to drink \\"Kung Fu Tea\\" in small tea cups. They clean the teapot first with boiling water to warm it up. Then they fill the teapot with tea leaves before putting in the boiling water. In Beijing, people love jasmine flower green tea. In Tibet, butter tea is a popular drink to build up energy.

While the article does mention the 'Kung Fu Tea' popular in Guangdong and Fujian, it does not state that this is the only type of tea consumed across all China, rendering option C incorrect. Similarly, the article presents that butter tea is popular in Tibet, not jasmine flower green tea, hence option D is incorrect as well. Option E contradicts the article's instructions that the cup should only be made seven-tenths full when serving tea, making it also untrue based on the article's information.

The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Given the below context: A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum. Guess a valid title for it!

The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics.

Please answer the following question: What was the reason behind you becoming a Wiccan? I had very bad experiences with the old angry bearded GOD in the Christian religion. He had turned his back on me. He had betrayed me time and time again. So, I left. Still wanting connection with a higher power, I hungered for connection. I liked communing with the Wiccan Gods. I also liked how They made me feel, at peace, and I felt I had the strength to change my own life for the better. They are always there for me. How did you find it? When I was a teen I heard the word Wicca. I didn’t know what that was. I was curious and decided to investigate it. So, the next day I went to a book store. I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any books on “Wicca.” She got excited and whisked me off to the metaphysical section of the store. She told me she was pagan and started handing me book after book into my arms. Soon I could barely see over the books in my arms. I mumbled behind the books, “Which ONE book would you recommend.” She then handed me Scott Cunningham’s book Wicca, A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner. I purchased the book and took it home. With my dyslexia it was not easy for me to read. But I started reading and plowed through the book. I found many things I was already doing. He talked about things I already understood to be true. The book rang true for me. I dedicated myself to the God and Goddess when I finished the book. Have you ever had any bad experiences after completing a spell? I did a prosperity spell once and got the opposite reaction I was hoping for. I lost all my income! I realized later my mistakes and redid the spell correctly and then got the results I truly wanted.

U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. After President Buhari's meeting with Trump, how does he really feel about President Trump? - He doesn't believe President Trump feels remorse for his comments - He is very cautious, but will use the relationship to his advantage - He believes they both suspended any ill feelings - not enough information","completion":"After President Buhari's meeting with President Trump, it is difficult to accurately determine his exact feelings towards the U.S. President. However, we can analyze some key aspects of their interactions and statements to make more informed assumptions. Firstly, it is likely that President Buhari does not believe that President Trump feels genuine remorse for his controversial comments about African countries. This is because Buhari carefully avoided addressing the issue directly during the press conference, stating that he's cautious about the press and prefers to remain silent on the matter. This suggests that Buhari might have doubts about Trump's sincerity, but has chosen to focus on their diplomatic relationships and shared goals rather than dwelling on past comments. Secondly, President Buhari appears to be a pragmatic leader, and he may see the opportunity to use the relationship with the United States to his advantage, particularly in terms of security and economic cooperation. This is evident in Buhari's gratitude towards Trump for approving the 600 million military sales deal, which had previously been suspended by the Obama administration. This indicates that Buhari values the practical benefits of working with the United States and is willing to engage with Trump regardless of personal feelings. Furthermore, it can be inferred that both leaders may have suspended any ill feelings for the sake of their countries' mutual interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. During their public remarks, both Trump and Buhari focused on the importance of their partnership and common goals. The friendly gestures, including Trump's joke about their shared love for helicopters, suggest that both leaders were attempting to create a positive atmosphere and acknowledge their shared objectives despite any existing tensions. In conclusion, based on the available information, it is apparent that President Buhari is cautious in expressing his feelings towards President Trump. He may have doubts about Trump's genuine remorse for his previous comments and might hold some reservations about their relationship. However, it seems that Buhari is pragmatic and willing to use their partnership to Nigeria's advantage, focusing on shared goals and mutual interests rather than lingering on negative past interactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: A). Dig a hole in the yard and fill with water B). Put a large tractor tire in the back yard and put a pool liner inside it. fill with water.","completion":"When considering the two options provided for making a pool for kids in terms of naive physics reasoning, Option B, \\"Put a large tractor tire in the back yard and put a pool liner inside it, then fill with water,\\" is more sound. This is due to various factors, including installation effort, stability, maintenance, and adaptability. Let's examine both options in detail. Option A: Dig a hole in the yard and fill with water 1. Installation Effort: Digging a hole in the yard could potentially be a very laborious process that requires a significant amount of time and effort. The ground could be hard or rocky, and digging to the desired depth might be challenging. Additionally, the soil may have to be disposed of, creating extra work. 2. Stability: A hole in the ground may not be uniform or have stable edges. The sides could collapse, causing potential safety issues or making the pool unusable. The ground may also be uneven, making it difficult to maintain a uniform water level. 3. Maintenance: A hole in the ground could accumulate debris such as leaves, dirt, and insects. It would require constant cleaning, as well as water treatment to prevent the growth of algae and the breeding of mosquitoes. Additionally, the use of a pool liner may be challenging due to the irregular shape of the hole, resulting in potential water leakage. 4. Adaptability: If at some point the pool is no longer desired, filling the hole back in would be labor-intensive and may not fully restore the yard to its original condition. Additionally, the pool location is fixed and cannot be easily changed. Option B: Put a large tractor tire in the back yard and put a pool liner inside it, then fill with water 1. Installation Effort: Assembling a pool by using a large tractor tire and a pool liner is relatively simple and requires minimal effort. Transporting the tire and laying down the pool liner can be done with relative ease. 2. Stability: A tractor tire provides a sturdy and stable structure for the pool. The pool will have a regular circular shape, making it easy to maintain uniform water levels. 3. Maintenance: The pool liner will prevent water from leaking out and protect the tire from damage. Moreover, it will be easier to keep the pool clean, as the contained structure creates a barrier against debris. Insects will also be less likely to make their way into the pool, ensuring a safer environment for children. 4. Adaptability: The tractor tire pool can be easily disassembled if needed. The tire and pool liner can be removed, and the area can be effortlessly reverted back to its original state. The location of the pool can also be changed without much difficulty. In conclusion, while both options could technically create a pool suitable for kids, Option B offers a more stable, easier to maintain, and adaptable solution. Utilizing a large tractor tire with a pool liner is the more sound choice in terms of naive physics reasoning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Love on the high seas: Where to get romantic on your next cruise Cruising is by nature a group experience, full of mixing, mingling and meeting new friends. But that doesn't mean it's totally devoid of romance. There's plenty of opportunities to affirm the bond between the two of you, strolling under the stars, staring into each other's eyes during a romantic dinner and otherwise experiencing the cruise ship scene from a perspective of amore. Here are some places on cruise ships where you can up the romance quotient. The smokestack: Smooching at night under the ship's smokestack is a time-honored tradition, but be careful not to get too frisky — there are security cameras watching. The karaoke bar/piano bar: What's more romantic than a serenade? Whether Metallica's Nothing Else Matters or Al Green's Let's Stay Together, show your love in song at the karaoke bar, such as those on Royal Caribbean and Crystal Cruises ships. If you can't sing, head to the piano bar and make a request of the piano player (Billy Joel tunes are particularly popular). The spa: Turn to mush with a side-by-side couple's massage. Two therapists do the rubbing and kneading. If you book your treatment in a spa villa, as available on some Princess Cruises and Disney Cruise Line ships, you may have opportunity to linger afterwards with a bubble bath for two. The promenade: During the day, passengers walk the outdoor deck area for exercise, play shuffleboard and otherwise enjoy the ocean breezes. At night, you can take a stroll arm in arm and look at the stars, often without anyone else in sight. Specialty bars: Snag a corner table and make a toast your love at the champagne bar, martini bar or wine bar. On Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Epic, Norwegian Breakaway and Norwegian Getaway you can bundle up in a parka and rub your cold noses together in the Svedka Ice Bar, where the temperature is always 17 degrees. Dance clubs: Clubs and lounges give couples the chance to dance to live bands and DJs. Show your ballroom skills backed by a big band on Cunard, dance the night away to scratch-n-spin masters trained by DJ Irie on Carnival Cruise Lines or do salsa at Boleros on Royal Caribbean ships. If there's an outdoor party – as on warm-weather itineraries of Seabourn, SeaDream Yacht Club and Windstar Cruises ships – take advantage of the opportunity to swing together under the stars. Specialty restaurants: Small luxury ships such as those of Silversea and Seabourn will accommodate a request for a table for two in the main dining room. But on mainstream ships, the best way to assure your own table is to book a specialty restaurant for a romantic date night. You get the bonus of upgraded cuisine and a more intimate atmosphere (a fee will be involved). Your cabin: While tight interior accommodations can be endearing in a shabby chic kind of way, couples seeking a romantic getaway may want to splurge on a larger stateroom with views. Upgrade to a balcony or veranda cabin for a \\"private\\" (others may be able to see you) lounging spot. Book a cabin with a tub if you're a bath lover (splurge on a suite and you may get a Jacuzzi). Your balcony: If you book a balcony cabin, take full advantage of your very own ocean views by staying in your bathrobe and ordering room service breakfast or dinner, served outdoors. Lines including Regent and Oceania will even deliver your meal course by course. Private cabanas/spaces: On some ships there is a hidden hot tub or patch of deck that few passengers discover, so it pays to read the deck plans carefully when looking for places to be at least semi alone. You can assure a degree of privacy by heading to the adults-only sundeck (a fee may be involved). Lines including Princess, Holland America Line and Celebrity Cruises also have open-air cabanas available to rent at the pool or elsewhere – the perfect place to listen to the ocean as you romantically hide away.","completion":"This article talks about fun things couples can do on a cruise ship to make their trip more romantic.

However, her grandmother took away all the money and put it in a bank account. Many students experienced the same thing as Chen. They got their gift money, only to immediately have it taken away. Xiong Shengyue, 14, from Nanjing, doesn't agree with the practice. \\"I think the money should be the children's, \\" she said. \\" We should take care of it by ourselves.\\" It is not that simple, said Chu Chaohui, a researcher at national Institute of Education Sciences. Giving gift money is used to show social status and develop relationships, he told Beijing Legal Evening News. Gift money has lost its traditional meaning of good will and has \\"little to do with the children\\". What's more, children don't earn the money through work. So he thought that parents should still play a big part in dealing with the money.

Sodium channels are integral membrane proteins that form ion channels, conducting sodium ions (Na) through a cell's plasma membrane. They are classified according to the trigger that opens the channel for such ions, i.e. either a voltage-change (\`\`Voltage-gated'', \`\`voltage-sensitive'', or \`\`voltage-dependent'' sodium channel also called \`\`VGSCs'' or \`\`Nav channel'') or a binding of a substance (a ligand) to the channel (ligand-gated sodium channels). are voltage-gated sodium channels always open? 1). no. 2). yes.","completion":"1). No. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are not always open. To justify the answer, let's go through the steps involved in the opening and closing of voltage-gated sodium channels: Step 1: Resting state: At the resting state (-70mV), the activation gate (the gate on the extracellular side) is closed, and the inactivation gate (the gate inside the channel) is open. Hence, sodium ions (Na+) cannot enter the cell due to the closed activation gate. Step 2: Depolarization: When the cell membrane depolarizes, the difference in voltage across the membrane changes. Once the membrane potential reaches a specific threshold (-55mV), the activation gate of the VGSC rapidly opens, allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell. Step 3: Inactivation: A few milliseconds after the opening of the activation gate, the inactivation gate closes. This blockage prevents further influx of sodium ions and eventually brings the channel to the non-conducting or inactivated state. Step 4: Repolarization: As the membrane potential returns to its resting potential, the inactivation gate reopens, and the activation gate closes, resetting the channel back to its resting state. In summary, voltage-gated sodium channels are not always open. They open in response to a change in voltage (depolarization) and close during inactivation and repolarization to maintain the proper ion balance and functioning of the cell."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Holiday: This word is a key subject in the sentence, as the discussion is primarily about a certain holiday. It appears twice in the sentence, reinforcing its importance. 2. Big: This adjective highlights that the holiday in discussion is significant or widely celebrated. It plays an essential role in understanding the context and value of the holiday in question. 3. Celebrated: This verb provides vital information about what happens during the mentioned 'holiday'. It tells us that this day is marked by certain activities or events, indicating it's of some importance or significance. 4. People: This is the recipient of the holiday's awareness or lack thereof. It is the group or body in which knowledge about this particular holiday is scarce. In this case, it extends the discussion from a simple subject, 'holiday', to a larger demographic, 'people'. 5. Outside: This preposition provides context to the geographic extent of the lack of awareness about the holiday. This word tells us that people from other regions than the UK constituent country don't know much about this holiday. It is critical in understanding the distribution of awareness or knowledge about this holiday. 6. UK: This abbreviation denotes the United Kingdom, providing geographical locus to the sentence. This word informs us about the local significance or origination of the holiday in question. 7. Constituent country: This phrase is further describing 'the UK' and suggesting that the holiday is specific possibly to one of the countries that make up the UK – England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. 8. Know: This verb is crucial as it tells us about the degree of awareness about the holiday among people living outside the UK's constituent country. Each of these words contributes to understanding the essence of the sentence – a significant holiday celebrated in a constituent country of the UK that people living outside aren't well-aware of.

What's more, there's a lot of it, defying the conventional belief that it couldn't grow there because there was too little light. The discovery, outlined in the new edition of Science, could shake up the current understanding of the region's ecosystem. \\"We were astonished,\\" says a Stanford University scientist in on the discovery off the Alaskan coast. \\"If you rank all the phytoplankton blooms anywhere in the world by the amount of phytoplankton that is contained in them, the under-ice bloom that we saw ... would finish at the very top of the list.\\" The algae seems prevalent wherever first-year polar ice is present, and the National Post notes that such ice is becoming more common as thicker multi-year ice retreats.","completion":"Title: Discovery of Algae Under Arctic Ice Shakes Up Scientific Understanding In a groundbreaking discovery, a team of scientists studying algae for NASA stumbled upon a phenomenon that defies conventional scientific understanding: algae thriving beneath Arctic ice. This research breakthrough, first reported by Agence France-Presse (AFP), is altering our understanding of ecosystems in cold climates, particularly in the Arctic region. Traditionally, it was believed that regions with minimal light, such as the under-ice environment of the Arctic, could not support the growth of photosynthetic organisms such as algae. This belief revolved around the fact that such regions lacked the necessary light conditions for photosynthesis, the key process in which most algae species produce energy. However, researchers associated with Stanford University, co-working on the project, found an abundance of algae beneath the Arctic ice off the Alaska coast, challenging these preconceived beliefs. \\"We were astonished,\\" one Stanford scientist shared, expressing their surprise at this unexpected find. According to the details in the recent issue of the scientific journal Science, the findings could overhaul our current understanding of the Arctic region's ecosystem. The prolific under-ice-bloom observed by the researchers would \\"finish at the very top of the list,\\" if one were to rank all the phytoplankton blooms in the world based on the volume of phytoplankton. Interestingly, the algae seem particularly prevalent wherever first-year polar ice is present. The National Post reported that such ice is becoming more common as thicker multi-year ice retreats, a worrisome climate change-related trend. This could have implications for the future of Arctic ecosystems, seeing as algae play a crucial role in the food chain, serving as primary producers. The appearance of these photosynthetic algae in an environment where it was presumed they could not survive indicates the climate's constant evolution and adaptation. Moreover, it sheds light on the significant impact global warming and changing ice patterns might have on endemic species and the broader ecosystem. This discovery emphasizes the vast uncharted territories modern science has yet to uncover and understand. It's not only a testament to life's incredible ability to adapt and thrive in the harshest conditions but also a reminder of the urgent need to understand and protect our planet's multitude of ecosystems in the face of climate change. The study once again proves that life on earth continuously adapts to the dynamics of our environment, often redefining our scientific understanding. As we witness the world continually evolve around us, the focus remains on deciphering these patterns further, to fathom the unfathomable, and unmask the hidden facets of our planet."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who does Christabel's portrait? ? Donna Foster works for publisher John Caine. She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine. A romance develops that leads to Christabel marrying Curtis and becoming a high society lady. However, it turns out that she is still attracted to Nick, whom she begins seeing on the side. On one occasion, she slips away from a vacation resort, telling Curtis that she is going to see her aunt Clara. Her lie is exposed by Caine, her uncle, who informs Curtis that the aunt had died while Christabel claimed to be visiting her.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Chester Cragwitch for the following movie plot: Teenagers Sherlock Holmes (Nicholas Rowe) and John Watson (Alan Cox) meet and become good friends as students at London's less-than-prestigious Brompton Academy. Watson is introduced to Holmesâ mentor, Rupert T. Waxflatter (Nigel Stock), a retired schoolmaster and inventor. Waxflatter's niece Elizabeth Hardy (Sophie Ward) is also Holmesâ close friend and love interest. Holmes is generally recognized as brilliant but considered an undisciplined troublemaker by most of the school administration. He is closest to Professor Rathe (Anthony Higgins), his fencing instructor, who warns Holmes that he is too emotional and impulsive. Meanwhile, a hooded figure uses a blowpipe to shoot Bentley Bobster and Reverend Duncan Nesbitt with hallucinogenic thorns, causing the men to experience nightmarish hallucinations resulting in their deaths. Holmes suspects foul play but is rebuffed by Scotland Yard policeman Lestrade (Roger Ashton-Griffiths) when he suggests a connection between the deaths. Holmes is unjustly expelled from the Academy due to a rival student Dudley's machinations, having had Holmes framed for cheating. As Holmes reluctantly prepares to leave, Professor Waxflatter is shot with a hallucinogenic thorn and accidentally kills himself while trying to fend off imaginary gremlins.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Just as with outdoor soccer, you will need a pair of shin guards, long socks, and shoes. However, instead of outdoor soccer cleats, you will need a pair of indoor soccer shoes, which differ by having flat outsoles. Lightweight sneakers or running shoes can also work in a pinch, but you will not have the same speed and ease of movement. If you are an outdoor soccer player adapting to playing indoors, spend some time getting used to juggling the ball indoors.

Indoor soccer is faster-paced than outdoor soccer, which will keep you in shape and also sharpen your playing skills but the rapid pace will take some getting used to. Focus on making quick passes and small, controlled movements with your feet until playing faster comes naturally. Be more verbally communicative. Because the game is so fast and you are in an enclosed space, expect to talk to your teammates more. Oftentimes you may deliver a pass only to find yourself in a great spot to receive the ball again. In these moments, it’s best to yell “pass” or otherwise let your teammates know where you are positioned.","completion":"The article offers advice on adapting to indoor soccer, including proper equipment, adjusting to faster-paced gameplay, controlling the ball, and emphasizing communication among teammates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S.

LONDON, England -- A military-grade laser that blinds temporarily is the latest security technology available to wealthy superyacht owners afraid of pirate attacks. The SeaLase laser temporarily blinds pirates -- preventing them from attacking the yacht. The \\"SeaLase\\" laser, similar to weapons used for crowd control in Iraq and Afghanistan by the U.S. military, has a range of four kilometers and becomes harder to look at the closer an attacker comes. At a distance of one kilometer, attackers develop strong nausea and can no longer see, according to Lasersec Systems, the Finnish company that developed the lasers for commercial use. \\"We don't have guns, so we need non-lethal systems to defend yachts,\\" Lasersec CEO Scott Buchter told CNN. Buchter, who recently launched the 104,000 multi-colored laser at Monaco Yacht Show, says the loss of eyesight the laser inflicts is only temporary and that no permanent damage is inflicted. Hi-tech military-grade security systems like SeaLase have become increasingly popular with superyacht owners looking to protect multi-millon dollar yachts on the open seas. Pirate attacks on oil tankers and other boats in dangerous waters like the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia -- a maritime link between Europe and Asia --have fueled the growing worry that superyachts may be the next target. Because law regarding the use of deadly force on ships is ambiguous in some countries and the transport of guns is illegal in most international waters -- yacht crews favor the use of non-lethal weapons for security. This has fueled the recent market boom for weapons like SeaLase, according to Buchter. SeaLase is the latest of these kinds of weapons, which include \\"L-Rad,\\" a long-range acoustic device that temporarily deafens enemies and the 450,000 \\"SeaOwl\\" tracking system, which combines radar and infrared or thermal cameras to detect incoming threats as far as five kilometers away. BAE Systems, the world's second largest global defense company, is thinking even bigger with plans for a sophisticated electronic early warning system for supertankers that some experts say could cost several million dollars. \\"Piracy is on the rise,\\" said Nick Stoppard of BAE systems. \\"Attacks in 2008 were double those of the previous year and there is a clear need for better methods to help commercial ships identify and evade pirates before an attack occurs.\\" The early warning system would use extremely advanced radars that could see over the horizon, as far as 25 km away. But pirates are not the only enemies of affluent yacht owners. For some, the paparazzi, using long range lens to take pictures of them on their yachts, can pose a privacy headache. According to reports in UK newspaper, The Times, Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich has installed an \\"anti-pap system\\" that would fire light beams at a camera, disrupting its ability to take images. Aside from the anti-pap system, it has been widely reported that Abramovitch's yacht \\"Eclipse\\" carries an anti-missile defense system and an escape submarine. The yacht is also said to have doubled in price to 1.2 billion since its commissioning three years ago. Michael Howorth, former super-yacht captain and technical editor at SuperYachtWorld magazine, told CNN for a previous article: As a yacht owner, \\"you would be an absolute fool if you didn't have this sort of advanced defense technology. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1. Military-grade SeaLase laser developed for commercial use to protect superyachts from pirate attacks. 2.

I bought this one because it said that it didn't have a logo, but when it arrived it had the word \\"PASSPORT\\" embossed very largely on one side which is not evident in pictures. I didn't have enough time to send it back before my trip. Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the product review can be considered as negative in nature, albeit with some positive aspects mentioned. Let us break down the review in parts to understand the reviewer's perception of the product. 1. Positive aspects: The review starts with the customer appreciating the good quality of the passport holder and describing its usefulness when traveling. The customer also mentions that the product is designed for easy fitting in front or back pockets, which is a convenience factor for users. These points reflect the satisfaction of the customer with the utility and design of the passport holder. 2. Negative aspects: The primary issue that the reviewer addresses is the presence of a large embossed \\"PASSPORT\\" logo on the product that wasn't evident in the product description or pictures. This implies a discrepancy between the expectations set by the product listing and the actual product received by the customer. Additionally, the customer points out that they specifically chose this product because it was advertised as not having a logo, causing further disappointment. 3. Time constraint: The reviewer also expresses their inability to return the product before their trip, due to time constraints. This may indicate a sense of dissatisfaction or inconvenience created by this unexpected feature of the product. In conclusion, this product review can be categorized as negative due to the dissatisfaction that stems from the discrepancy between the customer's expectations and the actual product. While the customer appreciates some positive aspects, such as the quality and utility of the product, their disappointment regarding the presence of an undesired logo makes the overall review lean towards a negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The mentioned hypothesis states that \\"The man is playing pin a tail on the donkey.\\" This hypothesis revolves around a man engaging in a particular party game that involves pinning a tail onto a donkey, usually an image on a wall, while being blindfolded. Comparing the premise with the hypothesis, there are noticeable differences. The man in the premise is blindfolded and hitting a pinata with a stick, a game that typically involves a person swinging at the pinata in an attempt to break it open to release its contents, such as candy or toys. This game provides a hint of similarity to pin a tail on the donkey, as both games involve a blindfolded individual. However, the similarity ends there. Pin the tail on the donkey does not involve hitting anything with a stick. Instead, participants must attach a paper or fabric tail to the image of a donkey on a wall while blindfolded. The game's objective is for the person to accurately place the tail as close to the correct position as possible. Given the differences in the activities present in the premise and those required for the hypothesis, the premise does not support the hypothesis. The man hitting a pinata while blindfolded is not playing pin the tail on the donkey, as the games, actions, and objectives are dissimilar. Therefore, based on the premise provided, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Power of Friendship: Boosting Mental Health and Happiness Introduction In our fast-paced and often solitary lives, the importance of friendship should not be underestimated. Genuine friendships provide us with support, laughter, companionship, and a sense of belonging. Spending time with friends can significantly improve our mental health and overall well-being. If you notice that your friend is feeling down or going through a tough time, here are some simple yet effective ways to uplift their spirits and help them feel supported. Step 1: Plan a Day Out with Your Friend One of the best ways to cheer up a friend is to spend quality time with them. Plan a day out and invite them to join you for a fun activity—something they've always wanted to do or that you both enjoy. It could be anything from hiking to visiting a museum or taking a dance class. The key is to make sure it's an activity that allows for conversation and bonding. Step 2: Get Your Friend Out of The House Sometimes, a change of scenery can do wonders for someone's mood. Encourage your friend to get out of the house and engage in a physical activity like a walk, run, or bike ride. This will not only help to increase their endorphins, but it will also allow them to enjoy some fresh air and take their mind off of their troubles. Step 3: Be Active Together Engaging in active pursuits together provides an opportunity for shared experiences and memories. Play a board game, attend a fitness class, or simply go for a walk. These activities can help to promote bonding and boost mood. Step 4: Show Affection, When Appropriate Some individuals appreciate physical touch and displays of affection as a way to feel supported and cared for. Offer a hug, hold their hand, or simply sit close to them – but only if it is something they are comfortable with. Step 5: Prepare Their Favorite Treat Sometimes, comfort food has a magical way of lifting spirits. Whip up their favorite dish or dessert, and enjoy it together. This gesture of thoughtfulness and care can go a long way in making your friend feel loved and valued. Step 6: Organize a Surprise Picnic Weather permitting, plan a surprise picnic in the park or another favorite outdoor spot. Pack a basket with your friend's favorite snacks and beverages, and enjoy the time together while basking in nature. Step 7: Host a Movie Night Arrange a cozy movie night at home, complete with your friend's favorite old-school film. Watching a beloved classic can evoke feelings of nostalgia, provide a sense of escape, and lead to much-needed laughter or relaxation. Step 8: Respect Their Need for Space Always remember that, while your support is invaluable, sometimes your friend may need some space to process their emotions. Be understanding and respectful of their needs, and assure them that you'll be there for them when they are ready. Conclusion Friendship is a powerful tool in promoting mental health and happiness. By taking the time to engage in these bonding activities, you can help lift your friend's spirits, improve their mental well-being, and reinforce the supportive nature of your relationship. So remember, the next time your friend is feeling down, reach out and offer your warmth, companionship, and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

International golfers were choking on the greens in Beijing over the weekend -- but it wasn't due to an outbreak of the yips. Hazardous levels of pollution descended on the Chinese capital during its biggest sporting weekend of the year so far, affecting competitors and spectators alike at an LPGA golf event and the China Open tennis championship, which boasted such big names as Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams. The sight of golfers wearing surgical-style face masks at the Reignwood LPGA Classic was hardly the advertisement that the sport was seeking for the first Ladies Professional Golf Association event to be held in China. Play was delayed for several hours Sunday to attempt to give the smog time to clear, before players including Germany's Sandra Gal and Colombia's Mariajo Uribe took to the fairways donning masks. Spectators at tennis' China Open, where Djokovic triumphed in the men's final and Williams in the women's, were also photographed wearing protective face masks. The pollution levels -- which saw visibility drop to less than 500 meters at times, according to China's National Meteorological Centre, and prompted the U.S. Embassy to advise its citizens to stay indoors and run air purifiers -- has led to questions being raised of the viability of international sporting fixtures in the northern Chinese city, or at least their continued ability to draw big names. Swedish doubles player Robert Lindstedt remarked about the dire conditions in his blog, labeling the air quality \\"a disaster\\" and \\"a joke.\\" \\"How much of your life disappears when you spend time here?\\" he wrote. \\"Already after a few days I feel that I am not doing (too) good. I get dizzy when I get up. Yesterday I couldn't recover between points in practice and was breathing heavily the whole hour. If you blow your nose in the evening, the paper turns black. It's just not healthy to be here. I should probably think about that next year.\\" David Shin, director of Sporting Republic, a company that organizes sports events in Asia, said it was unlikely Beijing would be able to continue to attract big names at sporting events unless pollution issues were addressed. \\"Beijing will always have big sporting events because they'll get the sponsorship and support from local government. But in terms of the caliber of the athletes -- the top athletes will have concerns about coming to Beijing. Regardless of their prize money and the lucrative offers they'll get to participate -- they'll have doubts about whether it will affect their health in the long term. If it does, is it worth coming?\\" READ ALSO: Djokovic beats new No. 1 Nadal to retain China Open title. Lindstedt is not the first athlete to raise concerns about competing in Beijing's smog. In 2008, reigning marathon world record holder Haile Gebrselassie refused to contest the event at the Beijing Olympics due to fears of the impact on his asthma, saying to do so would be \\"committing suicide.\\" A year earlier, the women's tennis number one Justine Henin pulled out of the China Open in the city for the same reason, while in 2011, organizers at the event were forced to turn on floodlights in the afternoon to allow play to continue amid the heavy smog. Shin, whose firm organized the Beijing Vertical Marathon up a skyscraper in August, said the capital's pollution levels were a particular concern for potential participants in running events in the city, and were among the reasons why the city's marathon, to be held later this month, would likely struggle to attract top-tier talent. \\"When it comes to runners, pollution in the air really affects their performance. We have to advise them to actually just stay at the hotel and train in the gym,\\" he said. \\"There are times when I've stayed at hotels in Beijing and haven't been able to see out the window.\\" The pollution issue meant the company had to give \\"serious thought\\" to running any sports events in the city. \\"As an event organizer safety is our first priority,\\" he said. \\"Even if you have a few serious incidents where people have to go to hospital because of the pollution, then that makes it not worth doing.\\" The smog, which also grounded a number of international flights out of the capital, came at the end of China's October 1-7 \\"Golden Week\\" holiday, a peak travel time for Chinese families to travel. Six major highways were closed Sunday, exacerbating the problem. Djokovic acknowledged the pollution issue after the event, saying it was less than ideal, but that players knew what they were dealing with. The Reignwood LPGA Classic was won by one shot by China's Feng Shanshan, in her second career victory. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

For eight years, a Pluto-bound spacecraft has been snoozing through space as it drifts nearly three billion miles (4.8 billion km) from Earth. But it will soon be time to wake up the New Horizons probe from its long slumber, as scientists prepare it for a six-month encounter with the dwarf planet. On December 6th, the piano-sized craft will come out of its hibernation to take historic images and data from Pluto – a dwarf planet whose appearance remains a mystery to astronomers. There remain many unanswered questions about Pluto. The New Horizons probe (artist's impression pictured) hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on July 15, 2015. Since launching in January 2006, New Horizons has spent 1,873 days in hibernation – about two-thirds of its flight time. It has had around 18 separate 'nap' periods spread from mid-2007 to late 2014 that ranged from 36 days to 202 days long. In hibernation mode, much of the spacecraft is unpowered; the onboard flight computer monitors system health and broadcasts a weekly beacon-status tone back to Earth. 'New Horizons is healthy and cruising quietly through deep space – nearly three billion miles from home – but its rest is nearly over,' says Alice Bowman, New Horizons mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The artist's impression shows the Pluto system from the surface of one of the smaller moons. Pluto is the large dwarf planet at centre, right. Charon, the system's largest moon, is the smaller body to the right of Pluto. 'It's time for New Horizons to wake up, get to work, and start making history.' On average, operators woke New Horizons just over twice each year to check out critical systems, calibrate instruments, gather science data, rehearse Pluto-encounter activities and perform course corrections when necessary. Next month's wake-up call was pre-programmed into New Horizons' on-board computer in August, commanding it come out of hibernation at 8pm GMT (3pm EST) on December 6. About 90 minutes later New Horizons will transmit word to Earth that it's in 'active' mode; those signals, even travelling at light speed, will need four hours and 25 minutes to reach home. As New Horizons travelled towards Pluto, it captured the dwarf planet locked in a mesmerising dance with its largest moon, Charon. The New Horizons spacecraft took the footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet in 2015. The 12 images that make up the animation were taken from a distance ranging from 267 million to 262 million miles (429 million to 422 million km). Put together, the footage covers Pluto and almost one full rotation of its largest moon, Charon, which orbits 11,200 miles (about 18,000km) above the dwarf planet's surface. Charon is almost half the size of Pluto. The moon is so big that Pluto and Charon are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system. The mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on Pluto's position against a backdrop of stars – to fine-tune the distance that New Horizons will fly past Pluto and its moons. Pluto's four smaller satellites are too faint to be seen in these distant images, but will begin to appear in images taken next year as the spacecraft speeds closer to its target. New Horizons took this footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet. The footage shows Pluto and almost one full rotation of its largest moon, Charon, which orbits 11,200 miles (about 18,000km) above the dwarf planet's surface. Confirmation should reach the mission operations team at in Maryland around 2.30am GMT on December 7th. At the time New Horizons will be more than 2.9 billion miles from Earth, and just 162 million miles – less than twice the distance between Earth and the sun – from Pluto. Top on the mission's science list is characterising the global geology and topography of Pluto and its large moon Charon, mapping their surface compositions and temperatures. They also hope to examine Pluto's atmospheric composition and structure, studying the dwarf planet's smaller moons and searching for new moons and rings. New Horizons' seven-instruments includes advanced imaging infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers, a compact multicolour camera, a high-resolution telescopic camera, two powerful particle spectrometers, a space-dust detector and two radio science experiments. The entire spacecraft, drawing electricity from a single radioisotope thermoelectric generator, operates on less power than a pair of 100-watt light bulbs. Distant observations of the Pluto system begin January and will continue until late July next year, with the closest approach to Pluto on the 14th of July. 'We've worked years to prepare for this moment,' said Mark Holdridge, New Horizons encounter mission manager at APL. 'Our team has done anything but, conducting a flawless flight past Jupiter just a year after launch, putting the spacecraft through annual workouts, plotting out each step of the Pluto flyby and even practicing the entire Pluto encounter on the spacecraft. We are ready to go.' Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1. New Horizons spacecraft to wake up after 8 years of travel, preparing for a six-month encounter with dwarf planet Pluto. 2.

He played as a midfielder for Sporting CP, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Internazionale before retiring on 31 May 2009. He won 127 caps for the Portugal national team, a record at the time but later broken by Cristiano Ronaldo. Renowned for his creativity and ability to get past defenders as a winger, Figo is regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation. Figo left Real Madrid to join Italian club Internazionale in the middle of 2005 on a free transfer after his contract with Madrid had expired. This meant that Figo would finally be able to play for a club in Italy, something he had the chance to do before his move to Barcelona, but was scuppered due to a dispute between the two clubs interested, Juventus and Parma. During the middle of 2008, Figo's compatriot Jose Mourinho joined Inter on a managerial level. This has been said to please Figo, as he would have several Portuguese teammates during the remainder of his stay at Inter. On 16 May 2009, Figo announced his retirement from football, the same day Inter won the 2008-09 title, and re-confirmed this on 30 May; his final game was on 31 May against Atalanta at the San Siro. At Javier Zanetti's insistence, Figo captained the side for his very last match. He received a standing ovation from the crowd as he was substituted by Davide Santon. The free-kick he scored in extra time against Roma during the Supercoppa Italiana was his most memorable moment in Italy. Figo said, \\"I am leaving football, not Inter.\\" He was interviewed by Inter Channel after his last game against Atalanta and also said, \\"I hope to be able to help this club to become even greater also after my retirement. I will certainly work for Inter in the future in the club board. I never imagined that I was going to remain here for such a long time. What I will never forget is the love that I have received since my first day here from my teammates and president Massimo Moratti. I will never forget it; Inter have given me the chance to start a winning cycle with some extraordinary people.\\" Figo was on the sidelines when Inter won the 2009-10 UEFA Champions League on 22 May 2010.

That balance has n't really existed this week , so I ' m hoping that the coming week will be different . Answer the following question: Why may some family members me mad at the narrator ?","completion":"Some family members may be mad at the narrator due to various reasons. Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the primary reasons may include the following: 1. Lack of work-life balance: The narrator acknowledges that they typically like to maintain a balance between their work and personal life. However, the past week has been different, with the narrator spending long hours at work. This shift in prioritizing work over family time could lead to family members feeling hurt, neglected, or disappointed, thus making them upset or mad at the narrator. 2. Absence during crucial moments: If there were special events, milestones, or challenges within the family during the week, the narrator's significant workload might have caused them to miss those important moments. Such an absence, especially during times of need, could create a sense of frustration and resentment towards the narrator among family members. 3. Unfulfilled expectations and responsibilities: Family members, depending on their relationships and age, often expect and rely on each other for various responsibilities. This could include household chores, emotional support, or spending quality time together. The narrator's excessive work hours might have led them to neglect these shared responsibilities, causing family members to become mad at them due to a sense of unmet expectations or increased burden on others to fulfill these duties. 4. Stress and fatigue affecting overall interactions: The narrator mentions that work has been \\"completely nuts\\" and that they were \\"ashamed\\" of the number of hours logged in. This level of work stress and fatigue can potentially affect the narrator's mood and overall interactions with family members, which may result in conflicts or strained relationships. 5. Concerns about the narrator's well-being: Finally, family members might be mad at the narrator because they are concerned about their physical, emotional, and mental well-being. Observing the narrator working excessively, feeling ashamed, and lacking balance in life may cause worry and anger among family members as they could interpret these actions as the narrator neglecting their own health. It's important to note that these reasons are inferences based on the context provided. The actual reasons for family members being mad at the narrator may combine or extend beyond these factors, depending on specific situations and the dynamics within the family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whole families were pressed up against the railings at Largo Argentina, the square in Rome, craning their heads toward ... a hole in the ground. Rome is full of holes in the ground, many of them historically significant, but this one was extra special. It contained the remains of the theater and temple where Julius Caesar was assassinated. But the kids weren't there for the ancient general-turned-emperor, murdered by treacherous senators in 44 BC. They were there for the cats. Rome's kitty ruins. Rome's noble ruins are a favorite haunt of feral cats. The \\"gatti di Roma\\" star on postcards and wall calendars sold all over the city. The ruins at Largo Argentina host an open-air cat sanctuary that's more than just a good show for visiting and local children. The city's strays have been fed and watered at the site almost since it was first excavated in the 1920s. The 1990s brought an injection of funds into the Torre Argentina Roman Cat Sanctuary, money that allowed more cats to be trapped, neutered and returned to their colony. Now, thousands of sterilizations are carried out each year -- around 30,000 and counting since 2000. More: How to Travel with Your Dog. Japan's cat islands. That's right: islands. Plural. Tashirojima in Miyagi Prefecture, is Japan's best-known feline isle. It usually goes by the name Cat Island. Dogs have been barred from Tashirojima for as long as anyone can remember. The island's cats vastly outnumber its human population. Tashirojima's furry inhabitants are well cared for by local fishermen, who hope to ensure a good catch by leaving offerings at a cat shrine. The island's most prominent structure, the Manga building and campsite, is embellished with a pair of pointy ears, in tribute to the island's lucky charms. Japan's other cat island, Ainoshima, is a little more remote, a 20-minute ferry ride from Shingu port in Fukuoka. A scrum of happy cats hangs out by the port, waiting for the next fishing boat or ferry to dock. In fact, the island represents a doubly incentive for the cats -- rugged Ainoshima is also a popular birdwatching site. More: The cat that saved a Japanese train station. Houtong, Taiwan. The riverside town of Houtong, Taiwan, fell into feline celebrity by accident. Houtong once sat on top of Taiwan's largest coal mine. When the mine closed in the 1990s, the town's population dwindled. Then some new, furry residents arrived. The Houtong Coal Mine Ecological Park (Houtong Road, Ruifang District, New Taipei City; +886 2 2497 4143) was established to showcase the mining heritage of the town and surrounding hills. But visitors mostly come to photograph the 120 or so playful cats, who laze around the Cat Village and soak up the fuss -- and inevitable treats. Houtong's proximity to Taipei -- it's an hour away by train -- ensures a steady stream of visitors each weekend. Cats here are used to amateur paparazzi.

Kalkan Kats (Turkey) A pretty resort on Turkey's Turquoise Coast, Kalkan is another tourist destination with an active cat protection squad. Established in 2008, KAPSA is a voluntary organization run by locals and expats that traps stray cats. KAPSA neuters them and provides basic healthcare, then releases them. Animal loving visitors regularly give up vacation time to help out and share their experiences and photos on the Friends of KAPSA Facebook group. When tourists disappear for the winter, KAPSA feeds and cares for more than a thousand cats, relying on donations to fund its operations. Eager photographers can snap cats all over Kalkan, snoozing on hammam towels, curled up in fruit bowls or enjoying the air conditioning in the resort's stores.

Does it follow that \\"Departments are required to disclose claimant fraud by the Treasury.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it follows that \\"Departments are required to disclose claimant fraud by the Treasury.\\" The original statement highlights that the Treasury necessitates departments to reveal instances of irregular expenditures that arise from incorrect benefit awards and fraud by claimants. This implies that departments are expected to be transparent and upfront about any discrepancies in their financial activities, especially those related to benefit awards and fraudulent behaviors by the beneficiaries. The Treasury, as the government's primary financial institution, has a crucial role in ensuring the appropriate allocation and utilization of public funds. To maintain accountability and safeguard the best interests of the nation and its taxpayers, the Treasury imposes various regulations and guidelines for government departments to follow. One such requirement is the disclosure of irregular expenditures due to erroneous benefit awards and fraud by claimants. The purpose of this requirement is to maintain a high level of transparency and accountability for the government's financial operations. By compelling departments to report instances of claimant fraud and erroneous benefit awards, the Treasury aims to identify areas where financial management can be improved, prevent the misuse of public funds, and rectify any issues that may be affecting the beneficiaries of these programs. Therefore, when the statement says \\"Departments are required to disclose claimant fraud by the Treasury,\\" it implies that it is the Treasury's guidelines and regulations that mandate the reporting of claimant fraud by the departments. This ensures that proper financial oversight is maintained, and any instances of fraud or irregular expenditures are addressed in a timely and efficient manner. In summary, the Treasury requires departments to disclose instances of irregular expenditures arising from erroneous benefit awards and fraud by claimants, which can be rephrased as \\"Departments are required to disclose claimant fraud by the Treasury.\\" The purpose of this requirement is to maintain financial transparency, accountability, and to prevent the misuse of public funds."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \\"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season. Jimenez took charge in October 2007 when former coach Juande Ramos left to take over at English Premier League team Tottenham. Question: \\"Why is Ramon Rodriguez grateful to Monolo Jimenez?\\" Response: \\"Because he made all the possible and impossible happen\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. Ramon Rodriguez is grateful to Monolo Jimenez because he made all the possible and impossible happen. This means that Jimenez worked really hard and did many great things for the team. But, unfortunately, he couldn't get the team to win more games lately, so they had to make a change and let him go."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Cheryl Ann Tweedy was born in Newcastle upon Tyne on 30 June 1983, and grew up on council estates in the suburbs of Walker and Heaton. She is the fourth of five children of Joan Callaghan, and the first of her two children with Garry Tweedy following the collapse of her marriage to the father of her three other children. Cheryl's parents were together for more than a decade but never married; they separated when she was eleven years old. At the age of seven, Cheryl appeared in a television advert for British Gas. In 2014, Cheryl returned as a judge on the UK version of The X Factor for its eleventh series, signing a PS1.5 million contract. She was joined by Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Mel B on the judging panel. She was again selected to mentor the girls category, and she chose Chloe Jasmine, Stephanie Nala, Lauren Platt and Lola Saunders for the live shows. Nala and Jasmine were eliminated in week 2 and Saunders in week 4, while Platt finished fourth. In 2015, Cheryl returned to The X Factor for its twelfth series; she was joined by Cowell and new judges Rita Ora and Nick Grimshaw. She was selected to mentor the groups category for the first time and chose 4th Impact, Alien Uncovered and Reggie 'n' Bollie for the live shows. Alien Uncovered were eliminated in week 1, while 4th Impact and Reggie 'n' Bollie finished in fifth and second place, respectively. Cheryl confirmed her departure from The X Factor in April 2016, choosing to focus on her music career. On 2 June 2014, she debuted the first single from her fourth studio album Only Human, \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\", which features Tinie Tempah. Later in the month, she performed at Capital FM's Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium. On 27 July, \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, selling 118,000 copies. It became her fourth number one single on the chart, making her the third British female artist to achieve four numbers ones as a solo artist, after Geri Halliwell and Rita Ora. The song also peaked at number one in Ireland. The second single from Only Human, \\"I Don't Care\\", was released on 2 November and similarly to its predecessor debuted at number one in the UK, becoming her fifth number one in the country. This made her the first British female to have five solo number one singles in the UK. Only Human was released on 10 November and became her fourth solo album to debut within the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It was later certified silver in the UK. The album's title track was chosen as its third single. The song, which originally peaked at number 70 as an album cut in October 2014, failed to reach the top 100 on the UK Singles Chart upon the single's release, therefore becoming her lowest-charting single to date. In 2015, Cheryl announced she was working on her fifth studio album, initially due for release in 2016.

It is sometimes possible to give approximate dates for the borrowing of individual Latin words based on which patterns of sound change they have undergone. Some Latin words had already been borrowed into the Germanic languages before the ancestral Angles and Saxons left continental Europe for Britain. More entered the language when the Anglo-Saxons were converted to Christianity and Latin-speaking priests became influential. It was also through Irish Christian missionaries that the Latin alphabet was introduced and adapted for the writing of Old English, replacing the earlier runic system. Nonetheless, the largest transfer of Latin-based (mainly Old French) words into English occurred after the Norman Conquest of 1066, and thus in the Middle English rather than the Old English period. What individuals introduced the Latin alphabet to the speakers of Old English?","completion":"Irish Christian missionaries introduced the Latin alphabet to the speakers of Old English, replacing the earlier runic system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The bones in the foot sit in an excruciating 90-degree bend and the nails in the stiletto make it look like some medieval tool of pain. This is a woman in high heels, photographed not with normal visible light, but with high-energy x-ray radiation of the sort doctors use to examine broken bones. But Hugh Turvey, who has spent almost 20 years creating x-ray photographs, isn't interested in medical diagnosis – his interest is art, in revealing a hidden world that the eye usually can't see. His x-ray photographs pull back the curtain on the structures deep within everyday objects. His image of a woman wearing stiletto heels – his wife, as it happens – is a prime example. \\"It's such an amazing contortion of the physiology of a foot… x-ray photography reveals that deeper understanding of it. It's so plain to see that you can't really ignore the truth of it,\\" he says. X-ray radiation is like visible light; it too is made up of photons. The difference is that x-ray photons are at a much higher energy, meaning that they can penetrate solid objects. The more dense an object, the more likely that even x-rays will be absorbed, which is why your dense bones stop x-rays while your less dense muscle and fat allows them to pass through. Turvey chooses different strengths of x-rays depending on what he is photographing. For a large and dense object, such as an elephant's skull, he might use an industrial-scale machine. For a delicate flower, he would use a smaller x-ray device similar to those you find in a dentist's surgery. \\"I've used equipment from just about every industry that uses x-ray technology, from medical to air security through to industrial applications. There is no right equipment for me, it depends on the object itself,\\" he says. The inspiration to paint with x-ray light came in 1996, while Turvey was an apprentice under the great rock photographer Gered Mankowitz. Asked by a music industry friend to investigate using an x-ray image for an album cover, Turvey went to the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead, north London, where the radiologists let him look through a bucket of discarded x-rays. \\"It was just one of those moments where you thought, 'God, this is amazing'. To the radiologists it's just a part of everyday imaging but for me it was a bucket of beautiful photography,\\" says Turvey. \\"From that point on things changed for me.\\" Nearly 20 years later, Turvey is the artist in residence at the British Institute of Radiology and has x-ray-imaged everything from rabbits in hats to motorcycles. His camera is whichever x-ray machine is powerful enough for the job and he eschews digital photography, instead using ultra-large format 11x14in film, which he says allows the images their \\"exquisite\\" detail. \\"The whole hands-on process of development is so beautiful because it's full of mistakes and potential mistakes. You just don't get those happy accidents in digital,\\" says Turvey. For Turvey, creating his photos, which he calls Xograms, is akin to stripping away the side of a building and peering inside. Once you strip away the facade, the inner structure becomes apparent, giving you an architect's overview of the workings of the building. \\"Ultimately, I think it reveals a truth, an unseen truth about the world around us,\\" he says. And when it comes to high heels, that unseen truth can be excruciating. Hugh Turvey's solo show X-POSÉ: Material and Surface, will be on display at the Oxo Tower Wharf, London. 12-23 February, 2014 What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Women in Syria constitute 49.4% of Syria's population, and are active participants not only in everyday life, but also in the socio-political fields. Notable examples are president Assad's chief political and media adviser, Bouthaina Shaaban, who also held office as Minister of Expatriates from 2002 and 2008, and Hadiya Khalaf Abbas, the officially elected speaker of the People's Council of Syria and the first woman to have held that position. Whatsoever, the Syrian Civil War put a new obstacle on Syrian women, forcing them to face increasing levels of violence, including war rape, and traditional abusive practices such as honor killings which occur in rural areas and areas held by extremist terrorists. In the 20th century a movement for women's rights developed in Syria, made up largely of upper-class, educated women. In 1919, Naziq al-Abid founded Noor al-Fayha (Light of Damascus), the city's first women's organization, alongside an affiliated publication of the same name. She was made an honorary general of the Syrian Army after fighting in the Battle of Maysaloun, and in 1922 she founded the Syrian Red Crescent. In 1928 Lebanese-Syrian feminist Nazira Zain al-Din, one of the first people to critically reinterpret the Quran from a feminist perspective, published a book condemning the practice of veiling or hijab, arguing that Islam requires women to be treated equally with men. In 1963 the Ba'th Party took power in Syria, and pledged full equality between women and men as well as full workforce participation for women. In 1967 Syrian women formed a quasi-governmental organization called the General Union of Syrian Women (GUSW), a coalition of women's welfare societies, educational associations, and voluntary councils intended to achieve equal opportunity for women in Syria. Women in Syria have also been integral in acts of nonviolence in response to the Syrian dictator, Bashar Al-Assad. In 2011, conflict was emerging throughout Syria due to the long reign of the Assad family. Throughout the 40 year reign, outbreaks of both nonviolent and violent acts emerged. Assad reacted to these actions by increasing arrests and the killings of Syrian men and women. In response to Assad's increasing arrests and killings, Syrian women and children gathered together. The women and children rallied together and marched to the main highway where they blocked the roadway. This act of nonviolence lead to civilians and military not being able to get where they were going to. This did not make the military very happy. The military came in with tanks and were making various threats towards the protesters but that did not scare them off. Later that day over one hundred Syrian prisoners were released. This was significant because the power women and children had through their nonviolent protest. Their issue of wanting their husbands and sons released from prison was understood by Syrian officials and they knew in order to get the women and children to leave would need to fulfill their demands.

The challenge comes as the nation continues to grapple with the aftermath of a highly polarized and divisive presidential election. Democrats cite multiple concerns for their decision to contest the results, ranging from voter suppression, allegations of fraud, and concerns about the state's election infrastructure. The challenge aims to bring attention to these issues and ensure the integrity of the democratic process. According to the Democrats, there have been reports of long waiting lines at polling stations, voter roll purges, and malfunctioning voting machines, all of which disproportionately affected minority and low-income communities. In addition, claims of voter fraud and foreign interference in the election process have further compounded concerns about the validity of the electoral votes. While the challenge is not expected to change the outcome of the election, it does signal an escalation of the political divide in the country. Many Republicans have dismissed the Democrats' challenge as unfounded and politically motivated, arguing that no concrete evidence has been presented to support their allegations. Despite the resistance, congressional Democrats are determined to make their voices heard in their fight for a fair and transparent electoral process.

Nancy Writebol, another missionary working with Samaritan's Purse, received two doses of the medication and has also shown significant improvement, sources say.

The drug, ZMapp, is an experimental treatment that has not yet been tested for human use, and its efficacy remains unclear. However, the dramatic improvements seen in both Brantly and Writebol have sparked hope and interest in the potential of this experimental drug in combatting the deadly Ebola virus. The use of ZMapp in these cases raises ethical questions about the application of untested drugs in emergency situations, and whether it should be made more widely available to those suffering from the virus. Additionally, the availability and production capacity of the drug is limited, which may lead to difficult decisions regarding its allocation.

She not only steals every scene that she's in, but is actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio, Warner Brothers (this film was made by R.K.O. Radio Pictures). She wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in London's Soho). Her body was so curvy when she was young. Get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard. And oh boy, she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene. Howard is a little too nervous throughout, but he does captures the hero's sensitivity. Frances Dee scores as the sweet, pretty young Sally who truly loves him. Max Steiner's score is both charming and poignant. Splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is clearly positive. The reviewer highlights various aspects of the film, such as Bette Davis's performance, her looks, the make-up and hairstyles, the score, and the overall adaptation of the classic novel, which they praise heavily.

Choices: - equatorial planes - geographic currents - geographic hemispheres - geographic poles A: A:","completion":"Earth's magnetic north and south poles are not the same as geographic poles. To elaborate, let's first explore the differences between magnetic poles and geographic poles. Magnetic poles are related to Earth's magnetic field, an invisible force that exists due to the planet's molten iron and nickel core. The magnetosphere, which is Earth's surrounding magnetic field, has two poles: magnetic north and magnetic south. These are the points where the Earth's magnetic field lines converge. The Earth's magnetic north pole is in the Arctic region but is not aligned with the geographic North Pole. In fact, it is a constantly shifting point due to the movement of the molten iron and nickel core, which generates Earth's magnetic field. Likewise, the Earth's magnetic south pole (located in the Antarctic region) is not aligned with the geographic South Pole. Furthermore, it is essential to mention that the Earth's magnetic field occasionally goes through reversal events, in which the magnetic north and south poles switch positions. On the other hand, geographic poles are fixed points on the Earth's surface that indicate the axis of rotation. Geographic poles are located at the opposite ends of the imaginary line that runs through the Earth's center, around which the planet rotates. These poles are known as the geographic North Pole and the geographic South Pole. The geographic North Pole is located at 90 degrees north latitude, while the geographic South Pole is at 90 degrees south latitude. These points are used as references in navigation, cartography, and the study of Earth's rotation and climate. In summary, Earth's magnetic north and south poles are not the same as the geographic poles. Magnetic poles relate to the magnetosphere and change position due to the dynamics within the Earth's core, while geographic poles are fixed points on Earth's rotational axis. The distinction between these two types of poles is essential for various applications, including navigation, studying Earth's magnetic field, and understanding the planet's climate and rotation."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the sector rose to 49.2 in August, but stayed below the 50 level, which indicates contraction. The index was up from July's figures of 45.9, its lowest for seven years. However, the Brexit vote was still the main factor weighing on activity, the report said. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: \\"Construction firms cited a nascent recovery in client confidence since the EU referendum result and a relatively steady flow of invitations to tender in August. \\"However, the latest survey indicates only a partial move towards stabilisation, rather than a return to business as usual across the construction sector. \\"There were still widespread reports that Brexit uncertainty had dampened demand and slowed progress on planned developments, especially in relation to large projects.\\" Ahmed: The economic bounce back David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, added that the weak pound had pushed up purchasing costs for the sector \\"at a rate not seen for half a decade\\". \\"Firms reduced their purchasing volumes as a result, as new orders and activity continued to fall - though at a more moderate rate compared to last month,\\" he added. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that \\"construction will continue to struggle until business confidence improves\\". He said the downturn in construction \\"looks likely to continue for several quarters to come\\" due to protracted Brexit negotiations and long lead times for any major public sector projects arising from investments announced in the Autumn Statement. Official figures last month showed the industry had fallen back into recession for the first time in four years. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said construction output dropped by 0.7% in the second quarter, following a 0.3% fall in the first quarter, meaning the industry recorded two consecutive quarters of negative growth for the first time since 2012. Markit's construction figures come ahead of its PMI for the UK's dominant service sector due out on Monday. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Alright kiddo, there's something called the Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) which measures how well the construction industry is doing. The number 50 is important; if it's above that, the industry is growing, if it's below, it's shrinking. In August, the number was 49.2, which means it's still shrinking but not as much as in July, when it was at 45.9. Brexit, or when the UK decided not to be friends with Europe anymore, is causing some troubles in the construction business. Some big projects are being slowed down, and companies are spending less money. People think this problem might last a while. They also said that the value of UK's pocket money (called the pound) has gone down, and that's making it more expensive for companies to buy the things they need. So, the construction industry is facing tough times, and we have to see if it gets better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Do you know about the Falkland Islands? They are called Las Malvinas in South America. These islands are a group of islands in the ocean, near the southeastern coast of a big country called Argentina. These islands have lots of birds and even penguins! Now, let me tell you about something that's happening there. Beneath the ocean water, there is a special type of liquid called oil. Some companies go and get this oil from the ocean and sell it to make things we use every day - like cars and toys! But, the leaders of Argentina have said that they will take some oil companies to court. This means they are not happy with what the companies are doing near the Falkland Islands or Las Malvinas as they call them. They want these companies to stop getting oil from that area. It's like when you sometimes have a game or toy you don't want to share or want someone else to use, and you tell them to stop playing with it or you'll tell a parent or teacher. Argentina's leaders are doing the same. They are saying that the oil companies are not allowed to take the oil from around the Falkland Islands and that they will take them to court if they keep doing it. We hope this helps you understand a little more about what's happening near the Falkland Islands and why the people in Argentina are talking about it.

Instead, Linnet marries Simon herself and they head off for a honeymoon in Egypt (the same place where Jacqueline had planned her honeymoon with Simon). A bitter Jacqueline follows them to Egypt, appearing wherever they go. Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) is also on holiday in Egypt. While staying in the same hotel as the newlyweds, he is approached by Linnet Doyle who is getting tired of Jacqueline's harassment.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence being true, let's break down both sentences and compare the information provided in each. Step 1: Break down and analyze Sentence 1 - The speaker lost their club. - The speaker had to pin the person down. - The speaker beat the person with their elbow. - Others intervened and pulled the speaker off the person. Step 2: Break down and analyze Sentence 2 - The speaker tells a man to run. - The speaker threatens to hit the man if he doesn't run. Step 3: Compare the occurrences in each sentence - In both sentences, the speaker has a violent intent. - In Sentence 1, the speaker uses physical force, whereas, in Sentence 2, they issue a warning. - Sentence 1 is more descriptive and states a sequence of events, while Sentence 2 is a statement about a possible action. Now, to determine if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence being true, we should consider the following: - Both sentences could have occurred in the same situation – the speaker tells the man to run before hitting him, loses their club, and resorts to beating the person with their elbow when they don't run. - The two sentences could also be unrelated or describe two different events.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity. Question: \\"What was one cruel way in which the Bushido Code was enforced?\\" Response: \\"Branding the vassals\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Please briefly summarize this news article: WalMart's Mexican Bribery Scandal Will Sink It Like an Iceberg Sank the Titanic Unlike previous Titanic films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome. (Photo credit: Wikipedia) WalMart’s been accused of bribing officials in Mexico to grow its business. But by and large, few in America seem to care. The stock fell only modestly from its highs of last week, and today the stock recovered from the drop off to the lows of February. But WalMart is going to fail. WalMart is trying to defend and extend a horribly outdated industrial strategy. WalMart succeeded by changing retail Sam Walton opened his original five and dime stores in the rural countryside, and competed just like small retailers had done for decades. But quickly he recognized that industrialization offered the opportunity to shift the retail market. By applying industrial concepts like scale, automation and volume buying he could do for retailing what Ford and GM had done for auto manufacturing. And his strategy, designed for an industrial marketplace, worked extremely well. Like it or not, WalMart outperformed retailers still trying to compete like they had in the 1800s, and WalMart was spectacularly successful. But today, the world has shifted again. Only WalMart is putting all its resources into defending and extending its industrial era strategy, rather than modifying to compete in the information age. Because its strategy doesn’t work, the company keeps wandering into spectacular failures, and horrible leadership scandals. All of these incidents show a leadership team that is so entrenched in history it will do anything – anything – to keep from evolving forward. And that history paved a pathway where it was only a very small step to paying bribes in order to open more stores in Mexico. Such bribes could easily be seen as just “doing what it takes” to keep defending the existing business model, extending it into new markets, even though it is at the end of its money-making life. It came to light that after paying the bribes WalMart’s leadership team did about everything it could to cover them up. Including spending millions on lobbying efforts to hopefully change the laws before anyone was caught, and possibly prosecuted. The goal was to keep the stores open, and open more. If that meant a little bribing went on, then it was best to not let people know. And instead of saying what WalMart did was wrong, change the rules so it doesn’t look like it was wrong. WalMart is in a performance whirlpool, and has no functioning strategic compass At WalMart right and wrong are no longer based on societal norms, they are based on whether or not it lets WalMart defend its existing business by doing more of what it wants to do. WalMart’s industrial strategy is similar to the Titanic strategy. Build a boat so big it can’t sink. And if any retailer could be that big, then WalMart was it. But these scandals keep showing us that the water is increasingly full of icebergs. Each scandal points out that WalMart’s strategy is harder to navigate, and is running into big problems. Even though the damage isn’t visible to most of us, it is clear to WalMart executives that doing more of the same is leading to less good results. WalMart is taking on water, and it has no solution. To prop up results executives keep doing things that are less and less ethical – sometimes even illegal – and providing guidance down through all levels of management and employment to do the same. Summary:","completion":"WalMart, a big store company, has been accused of giving money to officials in Mexico to help their business grow. Some people think this is like what happened to the Titanic, a big ship that sank because it hit an iceberg. They think WalMart's choices, like giving money to officials, will eventually cause it to fail, just like the icebergs caused the Titanic to sink. This is because instead of changing their ways to match new ideas and technology, WalMart is trying to keep doing things the old way and getting into more trouble."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Ricketts Glen State Park is in five townships in three counties. After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber. One squatter, Jesse Dodson, cut trees from around 1830 to 1860 and built a mill and the dam for what became Lake Rose in... answer the following question: What is the current name for Long Pond?

Some have framed it as an act of defiance against terror, while others saw it as a nod to the country's connection to surrealism. But CBC technology columnist Dan Misener says those Belgian felines also have something to teach us about online privacy and surveillance. As of Sunday night, Brussels was on lockdown, with subways, schools, and stores closed. Authorities there are conducting raids, searching for suspected terrorists. And as part of this, Belgian police made a request to the public — don't share police movements on social media. The goal was silence, to avoid social media posts that might interfere with the police or tip off the suspects they were searching for. But in response, Belgians started tweeting pictures of cats with the hashtag #BrusselsLockdown. Some saw this as a way to lighten to the mood and show solidarity in a pretty scary and surreal situation. The meme was also an example of obfuscation, which is an increasingly useful technique online — not just during manhunts, but in all kinds of situations having to do with privacy and surveillance. Finn Brunton is a professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University. He recently co-authored a book about the obfuscation tactic, called Obfuscation: A User's Guide for Privacy and Protest. He argues that if everyone on Twitter had remained silent about police movement, anyone who broke that silence would be that much louder. \\"The beauty of the public response was that it recognized this as the challenge,\\" he said. \\"And instead of everyone being quiet, people flooded the hashtag with this sort of charming and strange and basically innocuous material, such that even if someone tried to violate the ban, they wouldn't get anything out of it.\\" Essentially, by filling the #BrusselsLockdown hashtag with noise (in the form of cat pictures), people created a \\"needle in a haystack\\" situation for anyone trying to track police action via social media. BREAKING NEWS : Belgium Police using the new 200mph Hovercat during terrorist operations #BrusselsLockdown pic.twitter.com/MnIpiOZT3x Have we seen this tactic used before on Twitter? Brunton said he's seen this kind of obfuscation strategy used to flood Twitter hashtags in Mexico and Russia in the past — with one significant difference. \\"All of the previous examples that I have are examples of governments using [it] against their own people, trying to either stall protests or interfere with organizing activity around elections,\\" Brunton said. \\"And it's fascinating to see this technique being used [by citizens] in support of their government in taking action.\\" Obfuscation is a strategy for dealing with a situation in which you're monitored all the time, and where you can't avoid observation. So you can imagine this is particularly useful in a digital context, when it comes to maintaining our online privacy. Increasingly, our online activities are tracked across devices — by online services and advertisers, for example. But if an online service is tracking you all the time, you can throw it off by entering in a bunch of junk information —essentially making yourself difficult to track by hiding in plain sight. There are two pieces of software that are a good way to start thinking about obfuscation in everyday life. The first one is called AdNauseam. It's an app designed to throw advertisers off your trail, and keep them from building up an accurate profile of you. Basically, as you browse around the web, AdNauseam clicks on every single ad it sees. So from the perspective of an ad network, it looks like you like everything. Another useful piece of software is TrackMeNot. It's a browser extension designed to keep search engines from building up a profile about you. It generates a series of randomized search queries, so your real searches are hidden — once again, basically needles in an online haystack created by the extension. Or, of course, you could just start posting nothing but cat pictures, all the time. #BrusselsLockdown - because we can't hear your terrorism over the sound of our kittehs pic.twitter.com/c0F2y9PlMz Write a title for it.","completion":"Belgians Use Cat Pictures to Help Police During Brussels Lockdown"},{"prompt":"I heard that Skylar wanted a new shirt to go to the dance this coming Friday night.

See, e.g., Frazar v. Gilbert, 300 F.3d 530, 550-51 & n. 109 (5th Cir.2002) (concluding that the Medicaid Act does not possess an intricate remedial scheme regulating noncompliance by states and permitting Ex parte Young action on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries to secure EPSDT benefits); Mo.

Odom, 290 F.3d 178, 190 (4th Cir.2002) and provides a <HOLDING> token where the holding statement was extracted. We must find the correct holding statement among the given options. After examining the context of the citation, it is apparent that the courts in all of the mentioned cases rejected arguments barring suits for prospective injunctive relief, allowing Ex parte Young actions, and finding that the respective Acts did not possess detailed remedial schemes sufficient to preempt those actions. Now let's consider each holding statement: (A) holding that the medicaid act does not provide the type of detailed remedial scheme that would supplant an ex parte young action - This holding is consistent with the overall theme of the cases mentioned. It may be the correct answer choice. (B) holding that existence of a detailed remedial scheme shows congressional intent to prohibit recourse to the ex parte young fiction - This holding is not relevant to the citation, as it does not describe a decision in favor of allowing Ex parte Young actions. (C) holding that the medicaid act provision allowing reduction of funds to noncompliant states is not a detailed remedial scheme sufficient to show congress's intent to preempt an action under ex parte young - This holding explanation is related to the overall theme but may be too specific for the Antrican v. Odom case. (D) holding that ex parte young permits jurisdiction over officials who have authority to control the assessments of railroad taxes that are in violation of federal law - This holding is not relevant to the citation, as the theme is about allowing Ex parte Young actions and not about jurisdiction over specific officials. (E) holding that the cwa does not include a remedial scheme sufficient to preclude an ex parte young action - This holding refers to the Clean Water Act (CWA) and is not relevant to the Antrican v. Odom case, which is about Medicaid. Based on the analysis above, the correct holding statement for Antrican v. Odom, 290 F.3d 178, 190 (4th Cir.2002) is option (A): holding that the Medicaid Act does not provide the type of detailed remedial scheme that would supplant an Ex parte Young action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The trust said it was \\"working hard to maintain a safe service\\" and urged people to visit A&E for only \\"serious or life threatening\\" conditions. More on this and other stories from across Lincolnshire Dr Suneil Kapadia, medical director at ULHT, said: \\"We are putting in steps to change our medical model. This means doctors from other specialities will be asked to support A&E senior decision makers to diagnose and treat medical and surgical patients who come through the doors.\\" In a statement, the trust said its \\"supply of doctors is drying up\\". \\"We are overly reliant on short and long term agency doctors to fill staff rotas and due to a recent change in national tax rules (known as IR35), the availability of agency doctors has drastically reduced.\\" Boston Pilgrim A&E unit was also affected, but to \\"a lesser extent\\", the trust said.

Now we need to isolate r by moving the constant term, 156, to the other side of the equation. We'll do this by subtracting 156 from both sides: 52*r = -156 6. Finally, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is 52: r = -156 / 52 7.

Jean Alexander joined the show's extensive cast in 1988, during its 11th series, after gaining immense popularity through her role as \\"Hilda Ogden\\" on the British soap opera \\"Coronation Street.\\" She continued portraying Auntie Wainwright until 2010, appearing in over 150 episodes. During her tenure on the show, she played a significant role in both the storyline and the comedic aspects of the series. The character of Auntie Wainwright can be described as an eccentric and shrewd businesswoman who owned a cluttered and chaotic second-hand shop in the fictional town of Holmfirth. She possessed an extraordinary ability to sell anything to anyone, no matter how odd, damaged, or useless it may initially seem. Her character was notorious for finding a connection between a customer and an item, driving the hard bargain and almost always sealing the deal. In the series, the main characters – Compo Simmonite, Norman Clegg, and Foggy Dewhurst – would often cross paths with Auntie Wainwright, resulting in hilariously comic scenes and recurring storylines. Jean Alexander's portrayal of Auntie Wainwright was well-received by both the audience and critics.

By Sally NancarrowBBC News, Hastings The seaside town of Hastings is providing accommodation and training facilities for sprinter Ibrahim Turay and long jumper Ola Sesay. Hastings is hosting Tuesday's overnight stay for the Olympic Torch and Sierra Leone's two-strong team will appear on stage at the town's evening celebrations. As well as hoping for success in the 200 metres, Turay, 19, is looking forward to seeing his hero, Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, in action. \\"When I started in athletics I was a hurdler and the person I admired was my friend, Umar Allie, who was a hurdler and runner,\\" he said. \\"But now my hero is Usain Bolt.\\" Decade of war Turay is Sierra Leone's champion in the 110 metre and 400 metre hurdles, discus and 200 metres. He will be competing in London. He and his coach Abu Kumara were met at Heathrow on Thursday by members of Hastings Sierra Leone Friendship Link, which invited them to stay in the town. Sesay, who has been training in the USA, is arriving on Friday with the team's boss, while two other members of the entourage will fly in on Monday. The beginnings of the link began 10 years ago when Sierra Leone emerged from a decade of civil war. Lawyer Michael Foster, then Labour MP for Hastings and Rye, was asked if the town could raise humanitarian aid for the town of Hastings in Sierra Leone, which had been devastated in the war. \\"I thought that even though we were one of the poorest towns in the South East we could help one of the poorest countries in the world,\\" he said. \\"So I contacted the local churches and gave them the challenge of helping Sierra Leone.\\" The link's first project was raising £30,000 to rebuild 12 bridges which had been destroyed. A fundraising drive is now under way to raise more than £100,000 to build and equip a community centre and health centre. Hastings in East Sussex was officially twinned with Hastings near Freetown, Sierra Leone, in 2007. The Olympic delegation is staying at the White Rock Hotel on the seafront and training at William Parker Sports College. Former William Parker head Roger Mitchell, who is active in Hastings Sierra Leone Friendship Link, worked to get its athletics track installed. Turay begins training on Friday morning, and later children from schools across Hastings will gather at the college for their sports day - attended by special guests Turay and Sesay. Mr Mitchell said the event would inspire children across the town, many of whose schools are linked with schools in Sierra Leone. Turay and Sesay, whose travel and participation in the Games are being funded by the Olympic organisation, will move to the London Olympic Village after Tuesday's torch celebrations. Turay hopes London 2012 will be only the start of his Olympic career. \\"This is the biggest sporting event in the world,\\" he said. \\"I will get experience that will help me become a better person. Not everyone can become a champion but I believe I will be able to qualify for my country to run in the Olympic Games in 2016 in Brazil.\\"","completion":"Sierra Leone Olympic Athletes Find Support in Hastings, England"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question: If you get something, you'll what it? Here are possible answers to this question: - being happy - in underpants drawer - wanting more - then have - headaches I believe the correct choice is \\"then have\\", here's why: A:","completion":"In the context of this question, \\"If you get something, you'll what it?\\" suggests that the speaker is attempting to determine the expected outcome or consequence of obtaining a certain item or achieving a specific goal. Analyzing the provided answer choices, I deduce that \\"then have\\" is the most fitting response due to its emphasis on possession, in contrast to the other options. Here's a thorough reasoning for each possible answer: 1. Being Happy: This answer choice relates to the emotional aspect of acquiring the said \\"something.\\" While it is true that receiving or obtaining something could potentially elicit an emotional response like happiness, it does not directly convey the notion of having, owning, or possessing that particular item. Thus, this option is less suitable as a direct response to the question at hand. 2. In underpants drawer: This option appears to be a location-centric answer, potentially suggesting that the acquired item would be stored in the individual's underpants drawer. It neither communicates the idea of possession nor focuses on the consequential action or outcome resulting from receiving the \\"something.\\" Consequently, this answer is not the most fitting. 3. Wanting More: This proposed answer delves into the realm of desires after obtaining the \\"something.\\" It suggests that receiving the item in question may create a sense of longing for more, either by quantity or variety. While this reaction is plausible, it does not directly answer the posed question concerning the state or action of having the item itself. 4. Then Have: Among the available options, \\"then have\\" most accurately addresses the question. This answer highlights that once the \\"something\\" is obtained, the individual would possess or own it, thus succinctly tackling the query's focal point. 5. Headaches: This answer choice attaches a negative consequence to acquiring the \\"something\\" in question, implying that obtaining the item could cause headaches or stress. While this answer does involve a consequence, it does not successfully encompass the notion of having or owning the desired item or response. In conclusion, the most appropriate response to the question, \\"If you get something, you'll what it?\\" is indeed \\"then have\\" as it directly addresses the concept of possessing or owning the \\"something\\" once it is received or obtained. The other options, while providing potential reactions and outcomes, do not convincingly capture the core idea conveyed by the question as effectively or straightforwardly as \\"then have\\" does."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The language used in the review, such as \\"cheap junk,\\" \\"hinges cracking,\\" \\"whole damn thing useless,\\" \\"low quality,\\" and \\"defective items,\\" all demonstrate a strongly negative sentiment towards the product. The customer experiences issues with the product's quality, specifically, its durability and functionality. They mention that the hinges of the case crack upon opening, rendering the entire product unusable. This not only highlights the product's poor design and manufacturing but also the customer's frustration with spending money on a product that ultimately fails to fulfill its purpose. Furthermore, the use of uppercase letters in the phrase \\"LOW QUALITY DEFECTIVE ITEMS\\" can be interpreted as the customer trying to emphasize their extreme disappointment and irritation with the product. This further solidifies the negative nature of the review. In conclusion, the review is undoubtedly negative due to the harsh language, expressed dissatisfaction, and the criticism aimed at the product's build quality and performance. The customer's experience, as shared in the review, would discourage potential buyers due to the numerous issues they encountered, leading them to emphasize their experience as a warning against purchasing this particular product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It was the day after Halloween when my grandmother was admitted to the hospital with the worst headache she'd ever had. While posing in our costumes the night before, we knew something was wrong, just not how wrong. Grandma's house was the central gathering place of my family. Sunday lunches, birthday dinners, Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas -- all were our traditions, with her as hostess. While my parents were busy running their small business, there were many nights when Grandma fed me and put me to bed in her spare room, until they came to get me. I spent my summers at Grandma's and I went everywhere with her. I couldn't imagine a time when she wouldn't be around me. Then November 1, 1991 began her month-long stay in the hospital--she suffered from a rare infection called nocardia asteroides. After being born in the year of the Great Depression, living through World War II, raising three kids, and being widowed at the age of 48, Grandma never expected to live into her seventies. The infection in her brain seemed to confirm that she wasn't long for this world. But that's not the end of her story. A team of doctors successfully removed the abscess , and Grandma even made it into a local medical journal. Her doctor called her \\"the brain lady\\". Grandma celebrated her 85thbirthday in March this year. In the almost 23 years since her recovery, she's seen two of her four grandchildren get married and welcomed three great-grandsons. Although they damage something in her house, she loves it when my two boys come over. And while I know they make her day, seeing her love blossom for another generation makes my day too. Happy Grandparents' Day to my amazing grandmother! Options: A Running small businesses. B Spending summers at Grandma's. C Making Grandma hostess anywhere. D Gathering at Grandma's at special events.

If I tell you that When a cow moves, chemical energy is converted to mechanical energy, and ask you the question \\"what converts chemical energy to mechanical energy when it moves?\\", is the correct answer \\"birds\\"? OPT: + Yes. + No. Answer:","completion":"No. The correct answer is not \\"birds.\\" When a cow moves, it is their own muscles and the cellular processes within their body that convert chemical energy into mechanical energy, not birds. This conversion of energy occurs through a cellular process known as cellular respiration, which takes place in the mitochondria of muscle cells. In this process, nutrients like glucose, fats, and proteins are broken down to produce a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is considered the \\"energy currency\\" of the cell and essentially stores the chemical energy obtained from nutrients. When a cow moves, its muscles contract and relax. As muscles contract, they use ATP molecules to provide mechanical energy for the movement. ATP releases energy by breaking a phosphate bond, which results in the formation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). This energy release allows muscle fibers to slide past one another and generate movement. After this process, ADP can be recycled back into ATP through cellular respiration, allowing the cycle to continue as the cow moves. In conclusion, the process that converts chemical energy to mechanical energy when a cow moves involves its muscles and the cellular processes that take place within the mitochondria of muscle cells, not birds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — A New York judge has rejected a bid by Donald Trump's lawyers to throw out a state lawsuit that alleges the president disregarded the law in running his charitable foundation and instead used it as a wing of his presidential campaign. But, in the ruling posted Friday, State Supreme Court Justice Saliann Scarpulla reiterated that she would be forced to drop Trump from the lawsuit if a state appeals court weighing an unrelated case decides that a sitting president can't be sued in state court. In the meantime, Scarpulla said, New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood's lawsuit alleging that Trump used the nonprofit Trump Foundation's money to settle business disputes and boost his political fortunes can move forward. The suit seeks 2.8 million in restitution, the foundation's disbandment and a 10-year ban on Trump running any charities. Scarpulla rebuffed the contention of Trump's lawyers that the lawsuit was politically motivated. Given the seriousness of the allegations, she said, there was no basis for finding that \\"animus and bias were the sole motivating factors\\" for the lawsuit. Underwood welcomed the ruling. \\"As we detailed in our petition earlier this year, the Trump Foundation functioned as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests,\\" Underwood said in a statement. \\"There are rules that govern private foundations — and we intend to enforce them, no matter who runs the foundation.\\" Trump's lawyer, Alan Futerfas, said he's confident the president's side will ultimately prevail. \\"The decision means only that the case goes forward,\\" Futerfas said in a statement. \\"As we have maintained throughout, all of the money raised by the Foundation went to charitable causes to assist those most in need.\\" Former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman started investigating the Trump Foundation in 2016 after The Washington Post reported that its spending personally benefited the presidential candidate. Schneiderman ordered the foundation to stop fundraising in New York. Underwood was appointed to replace Schneiderman in May, when he resigned amid allegations that he physically abused women he dated. Schneiderman, a Democrat, has said he accepts \\"full responsibility\\" for his conduct and apologized \\"for any and all pain\\" he caused. Whether Trump remains a defendant in the Trump Foundation case hinges on how a state appeals court rules in former \\"Apprentice\\" contestant Summer Zervos' defamation lawsuit against the president. Trump's lawyers argue that a sitting president can't be sued in state court over conduct outside official duties, something Scarpulla and the trial judge in the Zervos case reject. Scarpulla wrote in her ruling that allowing the Trump Foundation case to proceed in state court is \\"entirely consistent\\" with the U.S. Supreme Court's 1997 ruling that forced then-President Bill Clinton to face a federal sexual harassment lawsuit concerning an alleged encounter while he was governor. If the appellate division were to side with Trump in the Zervos case, the Trump Foundation lawsuit could still proceed against the foundation and Trump's adult children, who were board members. __ Follow Sisak at twitter.com/mikesisak ||||| President Donald Trump gives a thumbs-up as he has Thanksgiving Day dinner at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Thursday, Nov. 22, 2018.

While the Constitution prohibits state courts from exercising \\"direct control\\" in a way that interferes with federal officers' duties, Scaruplla wrote: \\"Here, the allegations raised in the Petition do not involve any action taken by Mr. Trump as president and any potential remedy would not affect Mr. Trump's official federal duties.\\" Scarpulla noted that the defendants \\"have failed to cite a single case in which any court has dismissed a civil action against a sitting president on Supremacy Clause grounds, where, as here, the action is based on the president's unofficial acts.\\" \\"I find that I have jurisdiction over Mr. Trump and deny Respondents' motion to dismiss the petition against him on jurisdictional grounds,\\" she wrote.

Zervos, who has been pursuing a defamation case against the president, claimed that Trump forced himself on her in 2007. Trump has denied the claims. The Trump Foundation suit, filed by Underwood in Manhattan state Supreme Court, alleged that Trump had misused the Trump Foundation \\"for his own personal benefit.\\" The \\"pattern\\" of illegality, Underwood's office wrote, included \\"improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law.\\" After Underwood first filed the suit in June, Trump had vented rage on Twitter against \\"the sleazy New York Democrats.\\" --CNBC's Mike Calia contributed to this report. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A New York judge rejected a bid by Donald Trump's lawyers to dismiss a state lawsuit alleging the president disregarded the law in running his charitable foundation and used it as part of his presidential campaign.

I rarely take the time to write Yelp reviews, but after dining at Chez Gourmet last night, I knew I had no choice but to share my incredible experience with fellow food enthusiasts. From the moment I entered the restaurant, my senses were embraced with an immaculately curated ambiance, unparalleled attention to detail, and a culinary journey that still has my taste buds singing praises. Upon arrival, we were immediately welcomed by the hostess, who escorted us to our table while accommodating our request for a booth with a view. The intimate, low-lit atmosphere gave the space a sophisticated yet cozy feel, perfect for a cherished date night. The menu at Chez Gourmet is superbly curated, boasting a tantalizing array of succulent dishes with an inventive fusion of global flavors. I appreciated the precision in culinary techniques that were clearly evident in each dish. What impressed me the most was the passion and commitment to using fresh, locally sourced ingredients, ultimately supporting local farmers and purveyors. Our attentive server expertly guided us through the menu, offering suggestions based on our individual preferences. We started off with the Chef's artisanal cheese selection, which was beautifully presented alongside house-made crackers, fresh fruits, and a honeycomb that had an exquisite balance of sweet and savory. For our main courses, I chose the Seared Duck Breast with a citrus gastrique, while my partner opted for the Butter Poached Lobster with a delicate champagne sauce. Words cannot justify how delectable these dishes were! Each bite was an explosion of flavors harmoniously married—rich, bold, and utterly mouthwatering. We knew that we couldn't leave without trying one of the signature desserts, so we ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake. The warm, gooey center paired perfectly with the cool vanilla bean ice cream, culminating in a sensational finale to a memorable meal. In terms of beverages, the wine selection at Chez Gourmet is extensive and expertly chosen to complement the culinary offerings. I was particularly delighted with the sommelier's recommendation of a crisp Riesling to pair with my duck breast- a true testament to the staff's expertise. The exemplary service was consistent throughout our evening, as the staff were attentive without being intrusive. We were given ample time to indulge in our food, with refreshments and tableware replenished promptly and a genuine sense of care for our overall satisfaction.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"When there are many storms, it will directly impact the process of sedimentary rock formation. Here is an explanation of the steps involved: 1. Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock: During storms, more wind and water movement will cause a greater amount of rock fragments to break off. 2. The wind or water deposits tiny rocks: Storms will cause an increase in the deposition of these tiny rocks, as more sediment will be carried by the wind or water to other locations. 3. The rocks become known as sediment: With more tiny rocks created from the storms, the overall amount of sediment will increase. 4. The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top: As more storms create more sediment, the weight of additional layers will cause the existing sediment to become more compact, eventually forming sedimentary rock. 5. Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve: This step will also be affected by the storms indirectly, as more minerals will be present due to an increase in sediment formation. 6. Minerals glue the sediment together into a single rock: With more minerals present from the increased amount of sediment, there will be more minerals available to bind and create additional sedimentary rock. In summary, the supposed perturbation is directly impacting a step of the process as well as indirectly impacting some other steps.

Search Engines and Block Analysis with Image RetrievalWhat are some of the methods to combat the issues with linkage data, that search engines often depend upon for ranking one page over the next? If you're reading this, you most probably know all too well about how sites exchange links with ... What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about the challenges search engines face when using linkage data for ranking web pages and some of the methods employed to combat those issues. Linkage data refers to the web of hyperlinks connecting various web pages, which search engines often depend upon to determine the importance and relevance of a particular page and subsequently rank it in their search results. The main problem in this context is that some websites may manipulate links through schemes like link exchanges, buying, or selling, artificially inflating their position in search results. This affects the quality and reliability of the search results and hampers users from finding the most relevant and useful content. To tackle these challenges, search engines have adopted several techniques: 1. Improved algorithms: Search engines have developed more sophisticated algorithms to better evaluate the quality, relevance, and credibility of web pages, looking beyond just the number of incoming links to a page. Prominent examples include Google's Pagerank and TrustRank algorithms. 2. Content analysis: Analyzing the content of web pages helps search engines determine their actual relevance to a specific search query. By interpreting what a page is really about, search engines can deliver more reliable search results. 3. Block analysis: A relatively recent method to improve search results is block analysis, which divides web pages into smaller segments – or blocks – and examines the content and layout of these blocks to determine the weight of specific web elements and the importance of the information they contain. 4. Social media signals: Search engines also consider social media engagements, such as shares, likes, and comments, as indicators of a page's value and credibility. These data points help determine whether users find the content useful or engaging, and thus can serve as a more reliable signal for ranking purposes. 5. User feedback: Some search engines incorporate user feedback from their platforms to refine their ranking algorithms. This can help improve search result quality by incorporating human evaluation of websites' relevance and usefulness. These methods combined assist search engines in delivering more relevant, credible, and high-quality search results, combatting the manipulation of linkage data to artificially inflate rankings. By continually refining their algorithms and incorporating user feedback, search engines can better serve users in finding valuable and reliable information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The new Spider- Man movie is about to start and you've got the snacks: soda and popcorn. Food is part of what makes the movie fun. Just as the lights go out, you catch a slight smell of ...tuna fish?! You turn your head, searching for the source. Then you spot him: A couple rows back, some guy is enjoying a tuna fish sandwich. How's he get that in here? You wonder. Then you remember how much you paid for your snacks. What invites the unwelcome outside food is probably the price. Why pay 5 for a bag of M&Ms when you can get them for a dollar at the corner store? Earlier this year, a Michigan man decided to fight for his right to snack. Joshua Thompson is suing his local theatre after it banned outside food. He argues the ban breaks a Michigan law that prevents business from charging extremely high prices. However, most legal experts believe Thompson has little chance of winning his case though he does have a point: 85 percents out of every dollar of treats a movie theatre sells is pure profit . The truth is that movie theatres are more in the snack business than the movie business. A huge part of the ticket income goes to the Hollywood studio. This makes sense, since the studio have to pay the costs of movie production and advertising. But that often doesn't leave much cash for the theater, which also has its own running costs. If customers stopped buying food, owners would have to raise ticket prices even higher. Of course, there's another reason to think twice before bringing food into the movies: It's against the rules. Breaking those rules can be unpleasant consequences, too. Some theatres will kick you out if they catch you.

One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

I heard of Postino while reading another great issue of Phoenix Magazine while getting my hair trimmed at Great Clips. Hmm I said. This restaurant sounds intriguing. Making my way to the Gotham City of the desert, Gilbert, i maneuvered my Mini Cooper through the thriving metropolis, and parked in one of Postino's well graveled parking spots. It was then I entered Gilbert's version of a wine cafe. When I drink wine at a wine bar I expect it to taste like the nectar of the gods, unfortunately at Postino's this isn't the case. Their wine list is less insignificant then Tim Meadows's career. With so little to choose from I ended up ordering a wine I've never tasted before; a risky proposition to be sure. My wine ended up tasting like the liquid equivalent of Journey without Steve Perry. After emptying the reminder of my wine in one of Postino's urinals, I decided to eat some food. I ordered the bruschetta sampler in which i get to pick out four different kinds of flour based goodness. The pesto salami was definitely my favorite; sort of like Michael Winslow being my favorite in the Police Academy films.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: In which year did Valencia have a lower population, 2000 or 1900? Context: During the 20th century Valencia remained the third most populous city of Spain as its population tripled, rising from 213,550 inhabitants in 1900 to 739,014 in 2000. Valencia was also third in industrial and economic development; notable milestones include urban expansion of the city in the latter 1800s, the creation of the Banco de Valencia in 1900, construction of the Central and Columbus markets, and the construction of the Gare du Nord railway station, completed in 1921. The new century was marked in Valencia with a major event, the Valencian regional exhibition of 1909 (La Exposición Regional Valenciana de 1909), which emulated the national and universal expositions held in other cities. This production was promoted by the Ateneo Mercantil de Valencia (Mercantile Athenaeum of Valencia), especially by its chairman, Tomás Trénor y Palavicino, and had the support of the Government and the Crown; it was officially inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII himself.

A:","completion":"Yes, according to the information provided, the correct answer to the question \\"what helps producers make food?\\" is \\"decomposition.\\" Decomposition plays a crucial role in the cycle of life, particularly in the context of nutrient cycling and energy transfer within ecosystems. Before we delve into why decomposition helps producers make their food, we must understand the foundation of this process. Decomposition refers to the process through which organic materials, derived from dead organisms such as plants, animals, and microbes, are broken down into simpler forms. This process is carried out by decomposers, which include fungi, bacteria, and certain invertebrates that consume dead organic matter. An understanding of the concepts of \\"producers\\" and \\"consumers\\" in an ecological system is also essential. \\"Producers\\" are organisms that create their own food using energy from the sun or other inorganic sources. These organisms are mainly plants, algae, and some bacteria, which are the foundation for any ecosystem as they are the primary means by which energy is captured and introduced into the food chain. \\"Consumers\\" are those organisms that derive their energy by consuming other organisms, whether plants or animals. Now, let us examine how decomposition helps producers make food. Producers, such as plants, require essential nutrients, like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, to grow and produce their food. The process of decomposition releases these crucial nutrients from dead organic matter and makes them readily available for uptake by producers. This nutrient recycling helps maintain overall ecosystem productivity and ensures that producers have access to the necessary nutrients for their growth and energy production. In conclusion, decomposition is vital for nutrient cycling within an ecosystem and plays an essential role in helping producers make food. By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release key nutrients that producers utilize, making the correct answer to the question \\"what helps producers make food?\\" – \\"decomposition.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are a few factors that contribute to this perception: 1. Comparison: The sentence compares something to the movie or concept of \\"Freaky Friday.\\" This movie is generally known for its humorous, enjoyable, and unusual plot where two characters - a mother and a daughter - switch bodies. The fact that the comparison is made suggests that the situation being discussed may have some surprising or unconventional aspects. 2. Dismissal: By stating \\"it's not,\\" the speaker clearly rejects the aforementioned comparison, negating its relevance to the situation being discussed. This implies that the actual situation might not be as unconventional or amusing as \\"Freaky Friday,\\" or that what's happening might not be appreciated or enjoyable by the speaker. 3. Tone: The casual and informal tone of the sentence, marked by the use of contractions \\"it's not,\\" can project a sense of indifference or detachment. Rather than describing a situation in a neutral manner, the sentence seems to imply disapproval or lack of enthusiasm for whatever is being talked about. 4. Punctuation: The use of quotation marks around \\"Freaky Friday\\" and the comma after it separates the reference from the rest of the sentence. This creates a pause and emphasizes the distance between the comparison and the actual situation, further highlighting the mismatch that the speaker perceives. 5. Ambiguity: Without any other context or information, the sentiment of the sentence is open to interpretation. Some might find it humorous, while others might see it as dismissive. The ambiguity allows the reader or listener to gauge their own emotional reaction to the statement. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"\`\`freaky friday , '' it 's not .\\" can be perceived as slightly negative and dismissive. The use of comparison, dismissal, tone, punctuation, and ambiguity contribute to the reader or listener's interpretation of the statement, potentially causing them to perceive it as unenthusiastic or disapproving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He moved with his family to Memphis, Tennessee, around 1920. His mother was a \\"church woman\\". Thomas made his debut as a performer at the age of six, playing a frog in a school theatrical production. In 1960 he made his first recordings with his 17-year-old daughter Carla, for the Satellite label in Memphis, which changed its name to Stax the following year. The song, \\"Cause I Love You\\", featuring a rhythm borrowed from Jesse Hill's \\"Ooh Poo Pa Doo\\", was a regional hit; the musicians included Thomas' son Marvell on keyboards, Steinberg, and the 16-year-old Booker T. Jones. The record's success led to Stax gaining production and distribution deal with the much larger Atlantic Records. Rufus Thomas continued to record for the label after Carla's record \\"Gee Whiz\\" reached the national R&B chart in 1961. He had his own hit with \\"The Dog\\", a song he had originally improvised in performance based on a Willie Mitchell bass line, complete with imitations of a barking dog. The 1963 follow-up, \\"Walking the Dog\\", engineered by Tom Dowd of Atlantic, became one of his most successful records, reaching #10 on the Billboard pop chart. He became the first, and still the only, father to debut in the Top 10 after his daughter had first appeared there. The song was recorded in early 1964 by the Rolling Stones on their debut album, and was a minor UK chart hit for Merseybeat group the Dennisons later that year. As well as recording and appearing on radio and in clubs, Thomas continued to work as a boiler operator in the textile plant, where he claimed the noises sometimes suggested musical rhythms and lyrics to him, before he finally gave up the job in 1963, to focus on his role as a singer and entertainer. He recorded a series of novelty dance tracks, including \\"Can Your Monkey Do the Dog'\\" and '\\"Somebody Stole My Dog\\" for Stax, where he was often backed by Booker T. & the MGs or the Bar-Kays. He also became a mentor to younger Stax stars, giving advice on stage moves to performers like Otis Redding, who partnered daughter Carla on record. After \\"Jump Back\\" in 1964, the hits dried up for several years, as Stax gave more attention to younger artists and musicians. However, in 1970 he had another big hit with \\"Do the Funky Chicken\\", which reached #5 on the R&B chart, #28 on the pop chart, and #18 in Britain where it was his only chart hit. Thomas improvised the song while performing with Willie Mitchell's band at a club in Covington, Tennessee, including a spoken word section that he regularly used as a shtick as a radio DJ: \\"Oh I feel so unnecessary - this is the kind of stuff that makes you feel like you wanna do something nasty, like waste some chicken gravy on your white shirt right down front.\\" The recording was produced by Al Bell and Tom Nixon, and used the Bar-Kays, featuring guitarist Michael Toles. Thomas continued to work with Bell and Nixon as producers, and later in 1970 had his only number 1 R&B hit, and his highest pop charting record, with another dance song, \\"Do the Push and Pull\\". A further dance-oriented release in 1971, \\"The Breakdown\\", climbed to number 2 R&B and number 31 Pop. In 1972, he featured in the Wattstax concert, and he had several further, less successful, hits before Stax collapsed in 1976.","completion":"This text is about Rufus Thomas, an American musician and entertainer who recorded for the Stax label in Memphis, Tennessee.

There is a guy at the door who is in a worker uniform and informs me that the tree out front is dead and that he is a tree surgeon etc etc. I tell him that it's not in my garden and he would have to speak to the neighbour who owns the land/tree.

These towns have names that make people giggle like little kids. We are going to talk about three of them: Poo in Spain, Bitche in France, and Arsoli in Italy. Let's explore these funny-named places together! First, let's visit the small town called Poo, which is in Spain. Spain is a big country in Europe with people who speak Spanish. Now, don't think of the yucky stuff when you hear the word \\"Poo,\\" because this town is actually very pretty. It has a beach with soft, golden sand, and the sea has many shades of blue. People come to Poo to have a fun and relaxing day by the ocean. So even though its name sounds a little funny, Poo is a lovely place to visit! Next, we will go to another town with a funny name, called Bitche, which is in France. France is another country in Europe, and people here speak French. Bitche is an old and charming town with a big fortress, which is like a huge castle made of stone. This fortress is called the Citadel of Bitche. It helped protect the people who lived there a long, long time ago. Even though the name of the town makes us giggle, Bitche has a rich history and fascinating sights. Lastly, let's visit the small village of Arsoli in Italy. Italy is in Europe, just like Spain and France, and people here speak Italian. Arsoli is found in a beautiful area with lots of green hills and trees. The village has cute, old buildings, and the people are very friendly. Despite its funny name, Arsoli has a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere that anyone would enjoy. In conclusion, geography can be a lot of fun, especially when we find towns with funny names like Poo, Bitche, and Arsoli. These places may sound silly, but they are actually very beautiful and interesting. So next time you look at a map, remember that there are lots of amazing places in the world with unique names.

The band constantly shifted in musical style, drawing on genres such as punk rock, pop, folk, and experimental. Their anarchist or libertarian socialist political stance exhibited an irreverent attitude toward authority, and the band have been forthright in their stances on issues including animal rights, pacifism (early in their career) and later regarding class struggle, feminism, gay liberation, pop culture and anti-fascism. The band are best known for their song \\"Tubthumping\\", which was nominated for Best British Single at the 1998 Brit Awards. By the mid-1980s Chumbawamba had begun to release material using the vinyl format on their own Agit-Prop record label, which had evolved from an earlier project, Sky and Trees Records. The first release was the Revolution EP in 1985, which quickly sold out of its initial run, and was re-pressed, reaching No. 4 in the UK Indie Chart, and staying in the chart for 34 weeks. The first LP, Pictures of Starving Children Sell Records (1986) was a critique of the Live Aid concert organised by Bob Geldof, which the band argued was primarily a cosmetic spectacle designed to draw attention away from the real political causes of world hunger. The band toured Europe with Dutch band the Ex, and a collaboration between members of the two bands, under the name \\"Antidote\\", led to the release of an EP, Destroy Fascism!, inspired by hardcore punk band Heresy, with whom they had also toured. Both the Ex and Chumbawamba were released on cassette tape in Poland during this period, when music censorship was entrenched in Iron Curtain nations. The \\"RED\\" label, based in Wroclaw in south-west Poland during the late 1980s, only released cassette tapes and, despite the limits enforced by Polish authorities, was able to release Chumbawamba's music, in addition to bands from the USSR, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Chumbawamba's second album, Never Mind the Ballots...Here's the Rest of Your Lives, was released in 1987, coinciding with the general election, and questions the validity of the British democratic system of the time. The band adopted another moniker, Scab Aid, for the \\"Let It Be\\" song release that parodied a version of the Beatles song recorded by the popstar supergroup Ferry Aid to raise money for victims of the Zeebrugge ferry disaster. The 1988 album English Rebel Songs 1381-1984, originally released as English Rebel Songs 1381-1914, was a recording of traditional songs. How many records did they sell under that label?","completion":"The article does not provide an exact number of records Chumbawamba sold under their Agit-Prop label.

Information: - A communist party is a political party that advocates the application of the social and economic principles of communism through state policy. The name originates from the 1848 tract \\"Manifesto of the Communist Party\\" by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to Leninist theory, a Communist party is the vanguard party of the working class (proletariat), whether ruling or non-ruling, but when such a party is in power in a specific country, the party is said to be the highest authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Vladimir Lenin's theories on the role of a Communist party were developed as the early 20th-century Russian social democracy divided into Bolshevik (meaning \\"\\"of the majority\\"\\") and Menshevik (meaning \\"of the minority\\") factions. Lenin, leader of the Bolsheviks, argued that a revolutionary party should be a small vanguard party with a centralized political command and a strict cadre policy; the Menshevik faction, however, argued that the party should be a broad-based mass movement. The Bolshevik party, which eventually became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, took power in Russia after the October Revolution in 1917. With the creation of the Communist International, the Leninist concept of party building was copied by emerging Communist parties worldwide. - The South African Communist Party (SACP) is a communist party in South Africa. It was founded in 1921, was declared illegal in 1950, and participated in the struggle against apartheid. It is a partner of the Tripartite Alliance with the African National Congress and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and through this influences the South African government. - African Communist is the magazine of the South African Communist Party, published quarterly. The magazine was started by a group of Marxist-Leninists in 1959. It has its headquarters in Johannesburg. - The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is a trade union federation in South Africa. It was founded in 1985 and is the largest of the countrys three main trade union federations, with 21 affiliated trade unions, altogether organising 1.8 million workers. - The Tripartite Alliance is an alliance between the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP). The ANC holds a majority in the South African parliament, while the SACP and COSATU have not contested any democratic election in South Africa. - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Moses Mncane Mabhida ( 11 October 1923 -- 8 March 1986 ) was a South African politician . Mabhida was leader of the South African Communist Party from 1978 until his death in 1986 . - The African National Congress (ANC) is the Republic of South Africa's governing social democratic political party. It has been the ruling party of post-apartheid South Africa on the national level, beginning with the election of Nelson Mandela in the 1994 election, the first election after the end of apartheid. Today, the ANC remains the dominant political party in South Africa, winning every election since 1994. Its leader Jacob Zuma is the incumbent president of South Africa. - Apartheid was a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa between 1948 and 1991, when it was abolished. The country's first multiracial elections under a universal franchise were held three years later in 1994. Broadly speaking, apartheid was delineated into \\"petty apartheid\\", which entailed the segregation of public facilities and social events, and \\"grand apartheid\\", which dictated housing and employment opportunities by race. Prior to the 1940s, some vestiges of apartheid had already emerged in the form of minority rule by white South Africans and the socially enforced separation of black South Africans from other races, which later extended to pass laws and land apportionment. Apartheid as a policy was embraced by the South African government shortly after the ascension of the National Party (NP) during the country's 1948 general elections. Apartheid was also enforced in South West Africa until it gained independence as Namibia in 1990.

Once the pancake has reached the desired color on both sides, it is ready to be eaten. To do this, carefully slide a spatula under the pancake, gently lifting it off the griddle. Then, transfer the pancake to a serving plate. At this point, you can serve the pancake as is, or you can add desired toppings such as butter, syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or powdered sugar to enhance the flavor and presentation. It is also common to prepare multiple pancakes to create a stack, serving them either individually or family-style. Additionally, you may want to keep the pancakes warm while preparing the rest of the batch. This can be done by placing finished pancakes on a heatproof plate and covering them with a clean kitchen towel. You can then put the plate in a warm oven (usually set at around 200°F or 90°C) to maintain their heat until the entire batch is finished, and you are ready to serve them all together. In summary, the final step of this pancake-making process consists of removing the cooked pancake from the griddle and serving it, either plain or with additional toppings.

Question: what year lord of rings made? Answer:","completion":"Yes, it is accurate to state that The Lord of the Rings has had a significant impact on modern fantasy, and the terms \\"Tolkienian\\" and \\"Tolkienesque\\" have indeed been recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary due to the lasting influence of J.R.R. Tolkien's works. Regarding the question of what year The Lord of the Rings was made, it is essential to clarify whether we are discussing the book or the film adaptations, as those were created in distinct years. The Lord of the Rings is a three-part novel, written by J.R.R. Tolkien. The first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, was published on July 29, 1954. The second book, The Two Towers, was published on November 11, 1954. The third and final book, The Return of the King, was published on October 20, 1955. Collectively, these novels form the epic high-fantasy series known as The Lord of the Rings. In terms of the feature films, they were produced and directed by Peter Jackson, and each film corresponds to one of the three books in the series. The first film, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, was released on December 19, 2001. The second film, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, made its debut on December 18, 2002.

In Brookside, which character murdered her father and buried him under the patio and was also involved in the first lesbian kiss in a UK soap opera????","completion":"In the popular British soap opera \\"Brookside,\\" the character who murdered her father and buried him under the patio is Beth Jordache. Portrayed by actress Anna Friel, Beth was known for her turbulent and dramatic storyline during her time in the show from 1993 to 1995. Beth's father, Trevor Jordache, was an abusive man who physically and emotionally tormented his family for years. In a desperate bid to protect her family from his violent behavior, Beth ended up stabbing him to death. She then enlisted the help of her mother Mandy and brother, Tony, to bury Trevor's body under the patio of their home. The shocking storyline was a significant plotline in the soap, and the discovery of Trevor's body under the patio played a crucial role in later episodes. In addition to this unsettling storyline, Beth Jordache is also remembered for being involved in the first pre-watershed lesbian kiss in a UK soap opera, further solidifying her character's significance in \\"Brookside.\\" The memorable and groundbreaking scene, wherein Beth shares a kiss with Margaret Clemence (played by actress Nicola Stephenson), aired on January 12, 1994, marking a pivotal moment in British television history. At that time, the scene attracted a lot of attention and controversy due to its representation of a same-sex relationship. However, it has since been credited for pushing boundaries and contributing to the normalization of LGBTQ+ relationships and characters in television programs.

Over the centuries, the living here has always been easy enough to attract a steady stream of immigrants. Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family. Other tough migrants from the South Seas settled along the coasts — sailors, fishermen, traders (for the most part pirates) — known euphemistically as orang laut (sea people).

Does scrambler mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"scrambler\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In each sentence, the context of the word \\"scrambler\\" changes, leading to different meanings. To understand the differences better, let's break down the meanings and contexts of the word \\"scrambler\\" in each sentence. Sentence 1: Their quarterback was a good scrambler. In this sentence, the context is American football, as it refers to the quarterback which is a position in the sport. Here, a \\"scrambler\\" is a term used to describe a quarterback who has the ability to keep plays alive by escaping pressure, evading defenders, and running with the ball when necessary. This typically involves using their quickness, agility, and improvisational skills. Scrambling quarterbacks create significant challenges for the opposing defense because they can take advantage of breakdowns in defensive coverage by extending plays and potentially gaining more yards. Sentence 2: Scramblers can often unnerve a better tennis player. In this sentence, the context is tennis, as the reference to \\"a better tennis player\\" indicates. In tennis, a \\"scrambler\\" refers to a player who is skilled at retrieving and returning the ball, even when it appears out of reach or in difficult positions. Scrambler players are known for their incredible speed, agility, and tenacity on the court, often making seemingly impossible shots and frustrating their opponents. Their ability to prolong rallies and chase down balls puts intense pressure on their opponents, causing them to perhaps make more errors or take more risks, thus unnerving superior players. In summary, while both meanings of \\"scrambler\\" denote athletes who possess notable agility and adaptability in their respective sports, each term is sport-specific, with the first applying to American football and the second to tennis.

Choose tapes on which the people speak clearly and not too fast. Take it easy, at first. Success with simple tapes at the beginning is the answer. Later on you can practice with tapes that are more difficult. Finally, how can you learn to write well? How do you use little words like in, on, of and for? There are two answers to this. First, do some study with new words. Keep a list of verbs like look for, look after and so on. Second, read as much English as possible. There are many things that can't be learnt. You must see them in books many times. Then you'll be able to use them correctly yourself. So, in order to write well, you must first learn to read much. Options: A Many people find it difficult to listen to English. B Sit down and listen for an hour at a time. C Learn a poem or a song by heart can improve your speaking.

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only be broken by love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison but none prevailed. She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's first kiss.\\"(laughing) A green hand rips the page out of the book. \\"Like that's ever gonna happen.\\" Cut to an outhouse exterior.

He smiles into the mirror (but it cracks as in \\"The Munsters\\"). He jumps into a pond (and farts). Some dead fish float up, and he grabs one. After he gets dressed, he gets a giant slug out of a hollow log (for his dinner). Finally, he paints a \\"BEWARE.

The ogre is eating a bowl of eyeballs. He burps to light his fireplace, swallows the fish, and then relaxes in his easy chair. The men finally arrive at the ogre's house at night. The ogre hears them, and sneaks up behind them. He frightens them by telling them what he could do to them, then he roars and they all flee in fear. The ogre sees a poster on the ground and picks it up: \\"WANTED. FAIRY TALE CREATURES. REWARD\\".

During the summer of 1968, the Apollo program hit another snag: the first pilot-rated Lunar Module (LM) was not ready for orbital tests in time for a December 1968 launch. NASA planners overcame this challenge by changing the mission flight order, delaying the first LM flight until March 1969, and sending Apollo 8 into lunar orbit without the LM in December. This mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the Soviet Union might be ready for a piloted Zond flight during late 1968. In September 1968, Zond 5 made a circumlunar flight with tortoises on board and returned to Earth, accomplishing the first successful water landing of the Soviet space program in the Indian Ocean. It also scared NASA planners, as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight, not piloted, because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the Moon. On November 10, 1968 another automated test flight, Zond 6 was launched, but this time encountered difficulties in its Earth reentry, and depressurized and deployed its parachute too early, causing it to crash-land only 16 kilometers (9.9 mi) from where it had been launched six days earlier. It turned out there was no chance of a piloted Soviet circumlunar flight during 1968, due to the unreliability of the Zonds. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What animal was carried aboard the Zond 5?","completion":"Tortoises were the animals carried aboard the Zond 5 mission. This circumlunar flight, launched in September 1968, carried the tortoises, along with other biological specimens, to study the effects of space travel and lunar flyby on living organisms.

Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress. Question: \\"What did the president say would be two significant benefits of spending to rebuild many miles of roads, railways, and runways?\\" Answer: \\"It would create jobs immediately, and it would also make the economy run more smoothly over the long term\\" Is this answer correct?

Choose patterns or motifs that will add continuity. Go with colors that are easily duplicated for consistency. Work with a tattoo artist to design your sleeve.\\"","completion":"Title: Designing Your Perfect Tattoo Sleeve: A Comprehensive Guide Introduction: A tattoo sleeve – a large, intricate collection of tattoos that covers one's arm from shoulder to wrist – is more than just a bold fashion statement; it's a personal journey that often tells a story of art, culture, and identity. Despite its significance, designing a tattoo sleeve can seem daunting, particularly when you're unsure about where to start or what to incorporate. In this article, we'll delve into creating your dream tattoo sleeve, covering aspects such as choosing the right imagery and symbols, getting it done in sessions, selecting patterns and motifs, opting for consistent colors, and working with a tattoo artist to bring your vision to life. 1. Choosing the Right Imagery and Symbols: Your tattoo sleeve is an opportunity to express your individuality and share what matters most to you. Begin by listing down the images and symbols that have a strong connection to your personal journey or represent your passions and interests. Some popular themes include nature, spiritual elements, culture, and portraits of loved ones. You might also consider incorporating meaningful quotes or song lyrics. Ultimately, the aim is to curate elements that will resonate with you for a lifetime. 2. Getting Your Sleeve Done in Sessions: Tattoo sleeves require a significant investment of time, money, and patience – both on your part and on the part of the tattoo artist. To make this process more manageable, consider getting your sleeve done in multiple sessions. This will allow you to address any concerns or hesitations about specific designs or placements before committing to the entire piece. Besides providing you with the assurance that you're moving in the right direction, this approach also allows your skin to heal between sessions and minimizes the chances of complications. 3. Choosing Patterns or Motifs that Will Add Continuity: Once you've determined the key symbols and images for your sleeve, the next step is to ensure your design flows seamlessly and coherently. By choosing patterns or motifs that complement the elements you've chosen, you'll create a sense of harmony within the overall composition. Common patterns include geometric shapes, tribal designs, or flora and fauna motifs. Discuss your thoughts with your tattoo artist, and they can help you determine the best way to integrate these patterns and motifs, so they blend seamlessly with the main designs. 4. Going with Colors That Are Easily Duplicated for Consistency: Deciding on the right color palette is an essential step to ensure consistency throughout the sleeve. Bright, vivid colors may look attractive, but they could also be tricky to reproduce reliably throughout multiple sessions. Your best bet is to opt for colors that are easily replicated and stay true to their original hue even as your tattoo ages. Classic black and grey or darker, more muted shades typically work well in this regard. Remember, your tattoo artist has experience matching various shades, so don't hesitate to rely on their expertise in developing a consistent color palette for your sleeve. 5. Collaborating with a Tattoo Artist to Design Your Sleeve: Every step in the journey of creating your dream tattoo sleeve is significant, and the selection of a reputable, skilled tattoo artist is no exception. Look for someone who has a solid portfolio of previous sleeves and whose style aligns with your tastes. Open communication with your artist is vital – discuss your ideas, ask for suggestions, and be receptive to feedback. By working together, you'll be able to design a sleeve that reflects your personality and resonates with you for years to come. Conclusion: The process of designing the perfect tattoo sleeve can seem overwhelming, but with proper planning, it can be an exciting and rewarding artistic journey. By carefully considering the choice of imagery, getting your sleeve done in sessions, incorporating patterns and motifs for continuity, opting for consistent colors, and working closely with your tattoo artist, you'll create a masterpiece that tells your story and becomes an extension of your personal identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington (CNN) -- Astronaut Mark Kelly said Friday his wife's extraordinary medical progress since she was shot through the brain, coupled with support from family, friends and the public, were keys to his decision to command the upcoming flight of the space shuttle Endeavour. During a press conference with NASA officials -- who said they determined going with Kelly was the right decision -- the husband of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords described what he thought the realities would be after the January 8 shooting in Tucson, Arizona, and what he now expects. \\"At that time, my thought was I'd very likely would be sitting in the ICU seat, two, four or six months later, by her bedside,\\" said Kelly, sporting a blue wristband that reads \\"Peace, Love, Gabby.\\" Command of the shuttle flight came under question after","completion":"the tragic shooting incident involving his wife, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. There were concerns about Kelly's mental and emotional state, as well as the potential distraction the incident might pose during the flight. However, with the unwavering support from his family, friends, and the public, Kelly's resolve strengthened, and he made the decision to go ahead with the mission. As the launch date for Endeavour's final mission approached, there was an overwhelming outpouring of encouragement and support from people all around the world. Thousands gathered to witness the historic event, and many held signs and banners expressing their love and support for both Kelly and his wife. Under Kelly's command, the space shuttle Endeavour successfully launched, following a meticulously executed countdown procedure. The shuttle's six-person crew embarked on a 16-day mission to the International Space Station (ISS), where they worked on important research and conducted essential maintenance work. Kelly proved himself a focused and capable leader throughout the mission, demonstrating the qualities that had made him an astronaut in the first place. His fellow crew members praised his unwavering commitment to the mission despite the personal challenges he faced back on Earth. Meanwhile, Gabrielle Giffords' condition continued to improve, and she was finally released from the hospital to continue her recovery at home with her family. With each passing day, her strength and cognition grew, inspiring people around the world with her courage and determination. Upon Endeavour's return to Earth, Mark Kelly was greeted by his wife, who had insisted on being present for the shuttle's landing. Their emotional reunion, surrounded by friends, family, and well-wishers, became a symbol of hope and resilience, resonating far beyond their personal story.

Stalinism promoted the escalation of class conflict, utilizing state violence to forcibly purge society of claimed supporters of the bourgeoisie, regarding them as threats to the pursuit of the communist revolution that resulted in substantial political violence and persecution of such people. These included not only bourgeois people but also working-class people accused of counter-revolutionary sympathies. - A Primary Urban Area (PUA) is an area defined by the Department for Communities and Local Government in the United Kingdom as a statistical tool for analysing the major cities of England, originating as part of their \\"State of the English Cities\\" report and database. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic.

It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. - Leon Trotsky (; born Lev Davidovich Bronstein; 21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, a Soviet politician who engineered the transfer of all political power to the Soviets with the October Revolution of 1917, and the founding leader of the Red Army. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - Leninism is the political theory for the democratic organisation of a revolutionary vanguard party and the achievement of a dictatorship of the proletariat, as political prelude to the establishment of socialism. Developed by and named for the Russian revolutionary Lenin, Leninism comprises socialist political and economic theories, developed from Marxism, and Lenin's interpretations of Marxist theories, for practical application to the socio-political conditions of the Russian Empire of the early 20th century. - Russia, also officially known as the Russian Empire, was a state that existed from 1721 until it was overthrown by the short-lived liberal February Revolution in 1917. One of the largest empires in world history, stretching over three continents, the Russian Empire was surpassed in landmass only by the British and Mongol empires. The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire.

Trotskyists also criticize the bureaucracy that developed in the Soviet Union under Stalin. - Leinster ( ) is one of the Provinces of Ireland situated in the east of Ireland. It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster. Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster. The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes. In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties.

All adults should get a flu shot.; d). not enough information; Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Would \\"Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses , zebras have never been truly domesticated .\\" be a reasonable answer? * No. * Yes. The answer is:","completion":"Unlike their closest relatives, horses and asses, zebras have never been truly domesticated. However, this statement does not provide relevant information regarding the size of baby zebras upon birth. A more suitable answer to the original question is as follows: Baby zebras, also known as foals, are relatively large when they are born. Foals usually weigh between 55 and 88 pounds (25-40 kilograms) at birth, with an average weight of 70 pounds (32 kilograms). The height of newborn foals is typically around 30 to 32 inches (76-81 centimeters) tall at the withers (the ridge between the shoulder blades). Depending on their species, baby zebras are born with either a brownish or black and white coat, and their stripes develop more prominently as they grow older. It is worth noting that each zebra has unique striping patterns, which serve as their individual identifier. Similar to horses, baby zebras are precocial animals, which means that they are born well-developed and can stand, walk, and run shortly after birth. This adaption is crucial for their survival in the wild, as it allows them to escape predators more easily. In the wild, baby zebras rely on their mother's milk as their primary source of nourishment for their first six to twelve months of life. They also begin consuming grass after about a week of birth. The weaning process is gradual and can take anywhere from six to thirteen months, depending on factors such as the availability of resources and the mother's condition. In conclusion, baby zebras are relatively large when compared to other newborn animals, weighing between 55 and 88 pounds and having a height of around 30 to 32 inches. While the statement regarding zebras never being truly domesticated is true, it does not address the size of newborn zebras."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Article: Good Genes Mean Long Life Scientists have discovered that living to the age of 100 may have nothing to do with the lifestyle you lead and everything to do with the type of genes you have. For the lucky carriers of \\"Methuselah\\" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern . The \\"Methuselah\\" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare. The genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old. Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children. The studies show that tiny mutations in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy. David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread. \\"If we know which genes control longevity then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,\\" he told The Times. \\"Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged to take it.\\" Question: According to David Gems, _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"it is the duty of medical scientists to fight the problems of ageing\\"?

It wasn't very organized, but everyone was recognized and all the news that had to be told was told by each family member. We listened to each other and the interest was not put-on; it was real. Our family was a unit and we supported each other, and nurtured each other, and liked each other, and--we were even willing to admit--we loved each other. Today, the family roundtable has moved to the local fast-food restaurant and talk is not easy, much less encouraged. Grandma, who used to live upstairs, is now. the voice on long distance, and the working parent is far too beaten down each day to spend evening relaxation time listening to the sandbox experience of an eager four-year-old. So family conversation is as extinct as my old toys and parental questions such as \\"What have you been doing, Bobby?\\" have been replaced by \\"I'm busy, go watch television. \\" And watch TV they do; count them by the millions. But it's usually not children's television that children watch. Saturday morning, the children's hour, amounts to only about 8 percent of their weekly viewing. Where are they to be found?

That's where you find our kids, over five million of them, at 10 p. m. , not fewer than a million until after midnight! All of this is done with parental permission. Television, used well, can provide enriching experiences for our young people, but we must use it with some sense. When the carpet is clean, we turn off the vacuum cleaner.

Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere. Now, I have a new situation: John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Answer this question please: Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B?","completion":"To answer the question, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. Car A has a catalytic converter. 2. Car B does not have a catalytic converter. 3. Catalytic converters increase the rate of reactions that help convert unburned hydrocarbons into carbon dioxide and water, which are less harmful byproducts. 4. A car with a catalytic converter (in this case, Car A) would be more efficient at converting unburned hydrocarbons than a car without one (Car B). Based on these steps, Car A would emit less unburned hydrocarbons due to the presence of the catalytic converter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: The Jiul de Vest river is a tributary of the River Furu in Romania . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"The two sentences appear to contain contradictory information, and therefore, they do not convey the same information. To understand this discrepancy, let's analyze both sentences separately and in detail. Sentence 1: The river Furu is a tributary of the Jiul de Vest river in Romania. This sentence indicates that the river Furu is a smaller river that flows into the Jiul de Vest river, which occurs in Romania. A tributary is a river, stream, or body of water that flows into a larger body of water, such as another river or a lake. In this case, the river Furu is considered a tributary because it contributes to the flow of the Jiul de Vest river. Sentence 2: The Jiul de Vest river is a tributary of the River Furu in Romania. This sentence implies that the Jiul de Vest river is the smaller river, and it flows into the River Furu, also in Romania. Here, the roles of the rivers are reversed compared to the information in Sentence 1. Now, the Jiul de Vest river is the one that contributes to the flow of the River Furu. In conclusion, these two sentences present conflicting information regarding which river is the tributary of the other. For Sentence 1, the river Furu is a tributary of the Jiul de Vest river, while in Sentence 2, the Jiul de Vest river is a tributary of the River Furu. Due to this inconsistency, it can be said that these two sentences do not convey the same information.

Steps: 1. I start the translation by understanding the meaning of the English phrase \\"You've been bitten.\\" The information structure is \\"You\\", which is second-person pronoun, \\"have\\", which is auxiliary verb, and \\"bitten\\", which is the past participle form of the verb \\"bite\\". 2. It is important to understand that translation doesn't always happen word-to-word. So, a direct conversion of each English word to Telugu might not result in a grammatically correct or contextually meaningful phrase. Thus, the sentence must be comprehended as a whole before translating it. 3. I then use my built-in algorithms designed for translation, specifically from English to Telugu, to look for the most appropriate conversion. 4. The algorithms determine the translated phrase to be \\"మీకు కాటింది.\\", which is the equivalent expression in Telugu. 5. Hence, the solution to the problem statement, \\"You've been bitten.\\" translates to \\"మీకు కాటింది.\\" in Telugu.

Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources.

Aboard a Cargo Colossus In the chess match that has global powers looking for new ways to move goods around the world, the Mary Maersk and nine other sister ships are the biggest pieces. A helicopter appeared in the sky over the North Sea. It was 7 a.m. on a Wednesday this summer, and the helicopter circled in a wide arc before hovering above a ship traveling south at about 15 knots. At more than 1,300 feet long, the ship, the Mary Maersk, was hard to miss. It is longer than the Eiffel Tower is high, and the Mary and its sister ships are the biggest container ships in the world. Feet appeared first from the helicopter, then a pair of Levi’s, and gradually a man was lowered by rope onto the ship’s deck. His job was to pilot the ship down a narrow dredged channel in the Weser River, toward the port of Bremerhaven, Germany. Later that morning, the Mary would undertake the largest-scale act of parallel parking ever — or at least since the last time it docked, the day before, in Gothenburg, Sweden. As companies look for more efficient ways to move freight from factories in China to consumers in Europe, the Mary is among the newest giants, known as the Triple-E’s. Owned and operated by A. P. Moeller-Maersk of Denmark, the world’s largest container shipping company, the Triple-E’s went into service last year, muscling their way into the 210 billion container industry. They have also gained a following: Hobbyist spotters watch for the Triple-E’s and post pictures online, and Lego has created a mini version with 1,516 bricks. Until the late 1990s, the largest container ships could carry about 5,000 steel shipping containers, each about 20 feet long. Today, such ships are little more than chum. The size of container ships has exploded, reflecting their role as the packhorses of globalization. Each year, the maritime shipping industry transports nearly 13 trillion of goods, roughly 70 percent of total freight, according to the World Trade Organization. The Triple-E’s can carry more than 18,000 containers, piled 20 high, with 10 above deck and 10 below. But they can sail only between Europe and Asia, as their nearly 194-foot wide hull is too large to fit into American ports or to slip through the Panama Canal. The Mary will stop at a dozen ports, going from Gdansk in Poland to Ningbo, Yantian and Shanghai in China. It carries seafood. It carries auto parts. It carries perfume, grated cheese and frozen pork. While computers and clothing are among China’s biggest exports, chemicals and timber are more likely to leave Europe. The Mary — stacked so high with cargo that little is visible beyond two smokestacks and a glassed-in command center — is an apt symbol for an increasingly global marketplace. But it also represents the container shipping industry’s overreaching ambitions. Few carriers besides Maersk are profitable, too many new ships are being built, and demand for space on container ships is slowing as economies in Europe and Asia face headwinds. Maersk, based in Copenhagen, ordered 20 Triple-E’s from Daewoo of South Korea in 2011, increasing its worldwide capacity more than 10 percent. The timing was unusual. A report from the Boston Consulting Group, which counts Maersk as a client, called 2011 a year that “executives in the container-shipping industry would probably like to forget,” in part because a wave of new vessels ordered in earlier years swelled capacity. But demand for space has lagged since 2008, according to Drewry, a shipping consultancy that tracks the industry. The idle space at Maersk amounts to one Triple-E. “It’s a simple logic, bigger is better,” said Ulrik Sanders, global head of the shipping practice at Boston Consulting, “if you can fill it.” “There’s too much capacity in the market and that drives down prices,” he continued. “From an industry perspective, it doesn’t make any sense. But from an individual company perspective, it makes a lot of sense. It’s a very tricky thing.” The captain wears Crocs. He is standing on the bridge, in black jeans and a white shirt with black stripes at the shoulders. The captain, Franz Holmberg, is an easygoing Dane. There is a tattoo on his left arm of an eagle fighting a dragon; he says the image is “not as vivid” as it once was. A formidable camera rests among the bridge instruments — he likes to memorialize landscapes, such as the Suez Canal scene he uses as a screen saver. Not much happens on the ship, he says, but then he sits back on a couch just off the bridge and offers a few stories of the sea. Like the time a sailor thought the Danish queen, whose picture hangs in the dining room, began speaking to him. Or the time two Ghanaian stowaways were discovered huddled in a sealed crate. They had packed food in bags, and brought bags to defecate in. But after more than a week at sea, “they ran out of bags,” the captain says. He came from a farming family, but decided to try a life at sea and got hooked. After graduating from nautical school, he was a third officer on a ship that carried 3,800 containers, a fifth of Mary’s capacity. “Every time a new series comes out, everyone says this is it; it can’t get any bigger,” the captain says, adding, “Then a few years after, they just add a little bit more.” The industry wants ships that carry more containers, more slowly. Fuel prices are a major factor, so ships now commonly “slow steam” to save fuel, cruising at 16 or 18 knots instead of 22. A typical trip from Poland to China takes 34 days. During a recent voyage to the Suez, the Mary’s crew sailed on a parallel course with a 10-year-old Maersk container ship that held half as much cargo, but the Mary used only 6 percent more fuel. “We’ve seen during the last 10, 15 years a dramatic increase in fuel costs,” said Jacob Pedersen, an analyst at Sydbank, a Danish bank. “That gives them reason to get rid of the old uneconomic ships.” But fuel is only one part of the equation. “The supply of ships has far outstripped the growth rate” of container traffic, said Richard Meade, the editor of Lloyd’s List, a leading nautical newspaper, adding that the top shipping lines “have entered into an arms race in terms of size, led by Maersk” and its Swiss rival, the privately held Mediterranean Shipping Company. Newer ships, he said, “are more efficient, more economically viable and more environmentally friendly, but they are only going to deliver those results if they are full.” When the world economy slackens, so does the shipping industry. At one end of Mary’s route, the growth engine of China has been losing steam, while at the other, Europe is again flirting with recession. The shipping industry has also lacked significant consolidation, with shipping giants often seen as national assets. The top five container lines are either family- or state-controlled. Revenue at Maersk, publicly traded but family controlled, equals more than 14 percent of Denmark’s gross domestic product. Shipyards, conditioned to build ever-larger vessels, are cutting prices to keep their order books filled. The Triple-E’s were built for 190 million a ship, which in 2011 was seen as a relative bargain. By comparison, in 2007 China Shipping Container Lines, another major shipping line, paid 1.36 billion for eight ships, or about 170 million a ship — but those had a capacity of about 13,300 containers, nearly 5,000 fewer per ship. “In this down cycle, the new-built prices are low and money is cheap, so you would much rather go and buy the vessels than go and acquire a company” that has older ships, said Martin Dixon, director of research products at Drewry. “Many shipping lines are struggling to make money, so cost leadership is key to survival. Hence, you’re seeing a lot of investment in bigger ships.” The bigger ships, though, have been sustained by a growth rate in containerization traffic that has been two and a half to three times global economic growth for decades — and that seems to be coming to an end. “There are two types of companies that will survive this,” Mr. Sanders of Boston Consulting said. “Either you have the very large companies like Maersk” that “take advantage of scale and make money, or particular shipping lines that operate a niche where they dominate, like a feeder line out in Southeast Asia. “The other guys,” he added, “are caught in the middle and will have a hard time to make a decent return.” Jens Boysen is the Mary’s chief officer. Essentially, he is the captain’s right-hand man. While the ships grow, the crews don’t, in another economy of scale. The Mary has a multinational crew of 20 to 30 — and with so few, they multitask. Mr. Boysen, 35, is a blond, blue-eyed ethnic Dane who grew up in Germany. He doubles as medic, he explained during a tour of the ship’s small medical bay, which has a bed, a shower and drawers stuffed with pills and transfusion packs. He recounted an episode on the Mediterranean. “I had one motorman who, he was hammering on a shaft,” he began. “He used the wrong tool so some metal peeled off and actually was penetrating through the boiler suit, so there was a lot of blood coming out.” He wasn’t sure whether metal had lodged inside the man, so he approached the situation like an engineer. “We have a lot of magnets on board, so I just took a magnet to feel if there was something,” he said. “There was actually some metal, but we couldn’t get it removed, so we had to take him to the hospital later on.” The crewman was fine — problem solved. The cost of the crew and a range of other expenses related to running the vessel account for more than a quarter of the Maersk Line division’s cost base. Fuel represents more than a fifth. Cutting such costs helps Maersk steady its results. In 2009, the company lost 1 billion. This year, Maersk is on track to make 4.5 billion in profit, according to Bloomberg. Back in the medical bay, Mr. Boysen pulls out a metal box marked “dental” from a drawer and looked up. “I can also pull some teeth if you want.” Earlier this year, the Nicaraguan government announced plans to build a new canal system, bankrolled by a Chinese billionaire, that would compete with Panama and be wide enough to accommodate the Triple-E. Such plans have been floated before and failed to materialize, but it is the kind of audacious project that only the Chinese might try. No country more than China has spurred the containerization boom, a byproduct of moving the world’s factories thousands of miles from their biggest markets. Maersk is deeply embedded in China, with more than 20,000 employees there. It operates container terminals at seven Chinese ports, has bought 118 Chinese-made ships worth 3.5 billion and owns two Chinese factories that build containers. China is also exerting its influence on the industry. The country’s regulators recently blocked an attempt by Maersk and two European rivals to form a partnership, saying it would hinder competition. Maersk recently proposed a less ambitious alliance with a single rival, the Mediterranean Shipping Company. The proposed deals represent a concession that cargo volume is not rebounding as quickly, so shippers need to share costs and cargo space. Boats are typically full heading west to Europe and partly empty heading east to China. Cargo from Europe to Asia has grown about 30 percent in the last five years, in part because of rising demand from a growing Chinese middle class. But it has not nearly filled all the containers. At the same time, some manufacturing is moving closer to local markets, a trend that contributes to slowing growth in container traffic. China, too, is trying to foster its own shipping lines. This year, China Shipping Container Lines ordered five ships that will each hold 19,000 containers, about 1,000 more than the Triple-E. They begin to arrive later this year. But Jakob Stausholm, the chief strategy, finance and transformation officer at Maersk’s container shipping division, said that there was little room for ships to expand further. “This is still an attractive industry, but it will grow at a much lower multiple of global G.D.P.,” he said. “I really think that right now, given the size of container lines, given the level of sea freight, there is no benefit going toward bigger vessels.” How to Park a Whale It was time to park the world’s largest container ship. Several hours had passed since the first pilot arrived by helicopter, and a second, Karsten Burckner, 45, had come aboard from a tugboat gangplank. Soon he was smoking cigarettes on the far end of the ship’s bridge with the captain. He rolled them by hand, while the captain preferred his Marlboros. Mr. Burckner’s job was to help turn large boats in front of the harbor at Bremerhaven and back them into their spot alongside the port where towering cranes would soon begin hoisting crates on and off the ships. Speedy, it is not. Three tugboats nudged the Mary, while the ship’s twin engines fired in opposite directions. The ship began to rotate. It eased toward large rubber cushions on the dock. Beyond were steel shipping crates, stacked like dominoes and stretching out in a vast paved expanse in the port. They were scooped up by gangly red vehicles called “Straddle Carriers,” which are not much wider than a truck but tall enough to carry three or four crates. The two men looked over the ship’s side and spoke on walkie-talkies to sailors on the ground. Minutes passed — 10, 20, 30. The Mary, crawling at 0.1 knots, began sidling up to a pier. “Compared to the whole size and the weight of the ship, the steel plates in the side are actually pretty thin,” the captain explained. “If we get a speed higher than that, we’ll start buckling plates.” He smiled. “And that does not go well with anybody, obviously.” Mr. Burckner, too, was once a container ship captain — 11 years ago. But he had to give it up. “I was forced,” he said, pausing ominously and then smiling, “by my wife.” This is true of many pilots, who tend to be men who gave up the months at sea for home life. His ship carried 2,500 containers. “That was a big container ship then,” Captain Holmberg explained. “When I started, nobody was thinking that this size of vessel will be built,” Mr. Burckner said. “I don’t know where it will end,” he said, looking over its vast expanse. “Ask Maersk.” A version of this article appears in print on October 5, 2014, on page BU4 of the New York edition with the headline: Aboard a Cargo Colossus.

Beblawi’s government was subjected to criticism over the past few weeks by all colours of the political spectrum in Egypt. He was criticised by many for taking too long to declare the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation in the wake of an upsurge in terrorist attacks on the police and army in the aftermath of the violent dispersal of pro-Morsi camps last August. More recently, his cabinet came under fire by disgruntled workers after the exclusion of crucial groups of public sector workers from qualifying for a newly passed minimum wage law fuelled fury among workers, leading to strikes in a number of crucial sectors of the economy. Public transport workers, textile workers, low-ranking policemen, postal workers and doctors are among a number of governmental sectors that went on strike in the past few days. An official source told Ahram Online that Interim President Adly Mansour is expected to accept the cabinet's resignation and commission Ibrahim Mahleb, minister of housing in Beblawi’s government, to form the new cabinet. In his statement, Beblawi, a co-founder of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, said his government had accepted the responsibility at the time of its appointment because its ministers were among the few willing to face that challenge, and not because they were the most qualified. El-Beblawi served as undersecretary-general at the UN between 1995 and 2000. He was minister of finance in Essam Sharaf's cabinet from July to October 2011 during Egypt's post-revolution army-administered transitional phase. He resigned in October 2011 to object to clashes in Cairo's Maspero district between military police and Coptic protesters in which 28 of the latter were killed. Short link: ||||| A man stands on a bridge where huge posters of Egypt's Army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi are hanged in central Cairo February 3, 2014. CAIRO Egypt's government resigned on Monday, paving the way for army chief Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to declare his candidacy for president of a strategic U.S. ally gripped by political strife. After the July overthrow of elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi and subsequent crackdown on Islamists and liberals with hundreds killed and thousands jailed, critics say Cairo's military-backed authorities are turning the clock back to the era of autocrat Hosni Mubarak, when the political elite ruled with an iron fist in alliance with top businessmen. The outgoing government \\"made every effort to get Egypt out of the narrow tunnel in terms of security, economic pressures and political confusion,\\" Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi said in a live nationwide speech. Beblawi, who was tasked by interim President Adly Mansour with running the government's affairs until the election, did not give a clear reason for the decision. But the resignation effectively opened the way for Sisi to run for president since he would first have to leave his post as defense minister in any case. \\"This (government resignation) was done as a step that was needed ahead of Sisi's announcement that he will run for president,\\" an Egyptian official said. He told Reuters that the cabinet had resigned en masse because Sisi did not want to appear to be acting alone. Government spokesman Hany Salah said only: \\"This government feels that it did what it had to do in this critical period, and maybe it's time for a change.\\" Sisi has unveiled a political roadmap meant to lead to elections after toppling Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood following mass unrest against his increasingly arbitrary rule. But promises of democracy have not borne fruit in what is the world's biggest Arab nation, where hundreds of thousands of people gathered in 2011 in an army-backed uprising that overthrew Mubarak and raised hopes of a new political landscape. The presidential vote is expected within months. The United States, Cairo's main Western ally and military backer, has expressed concern for democracy since Mursi was ousted, but has also described Egypt, which has a peace treaty with Israel and controls the Suez Canal, as a vital partner. On Monday, the U.S. State Department said it was surprised by the government's resignation. Washington is watching the situation closely and seeking details from Egyptian counterparts, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. \\"This step was unexpected, so we are looking to obtain information on it,\\" she told a regular news briefing. \\"Our focus ... remains on pressing and encouraging Egypt to take steps forward that will advance an inclusive transition process that leads to a democratic civilian-led government selected through a credible and transparent elections process,\\" Psaki said. ZEROING IN ON THE BROTHERHOOD Egypt's stock market rose 0.26 percent after news of the government's departure to 8029.37 points, reversing losses from earlier in the day. Mursi's removal touched off the bloodiest political crisis in modern Egyptian history. Security forces killed hundreds of Brotherhood supporters and jailed thousands, and top leaders were put on trial. The Muslim Brotherhood accused Sisi of plotting a coup to restore military-dominated government, and human rights groups say abuses are spreading by the day, allegations the army-backed government denies. Housing Minister Ibrahim Mahlab, a former official in Mubarak's National Democratic Party, was expected to be named prime minister of the new government, said a security source. The Egyptian authorities are likely to remain preoccupied with efforts to further weaken and isolate the Muslim Brotherhood and fight a mushrooming Islamist insurgency. The government has also clamped down on some secular activists who were instrumental in the popular uprising that deposed Mubarak, and who supported Mursi's removal. They are now languishing in prisons and face trial. Compounding the instability, Islamist militants based in the widely lawless Sinai Peninsula have intensified attacks on police and soldiers, killing hundreds since Mursi's fall. The Sinai-based group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed two South Koreans last week, inflicting yet more harm on a tourism industry gutted by political turmoil and protests. Ansar also said that it was behind assassinations of army and Interior Ministry officials. A security source said Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim, who has been spearheading the campaign to crush the Brotherhood, was expected to retain his post in the hope he could provide tight security before elections. He survived an assassination attempt by a suicide bomber last year. The Gulf Arab states of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, deeply suspicious of the Muslim Brotherhood, showered Egypt with billions of dollars in aid after Mursi's political demise. That raised the morale of the government and filled state coffers. But any new government will be under pressure to come up with long-term plans to strengthen the tottering economy.

Given the context: How would Robin feel afterwards? pick from the following. (a). like they could keep shopping (b). like they got a great deal (c). like heading home for the day A:","completion":"Based on the provided context, it is most likely that Robin would feel like they got a great deal (option b) after buying the birthday present immediately after it went on sale. This is because the sale would generally imply a discount or a reduced price, which is something that customers tend to appreciate, as it allows them to save money or buy a better quality product at a lower price than they initially planned. The sale event usually triggers a sense of urgency and excitement in customers due to the limited nature of such deals (as the stocks could run out or the sale wouldn't last for too long). Therefore, Robin, being aware of the sale and making the purchase immediately after it went on sale, would have acted quickly to benefit from the reduced price. The satisfaction of acquiring a gift at a lower cost could potentially induce positive emotions such as happiness and satisfaction, making Robin feel like they made a smart and successful purchase. This sense of accomplishment can boost Robin's mood and make them feel like they are proficient in finding good deals. Furthermore, that feeling of having made a great deal can also increase the value Robin associates with the present. Being able to obtain a desired item for a loved one at a better price can reinforce the thought that they have made a thoughtful and wise decision, which in turn, contributes to feeling great about the purchase. In conclusion, given that Robin bought the birthday present immediately after it went on sale, it is most probable that they felt like they got a great deal (option b). This feeling stems from the satisfaction of saving money, acting promptly, and making a successful purchase that is of value both to Robin and the person who will receive the gift. Such an experience results in happiness, accomplishment, and a sense of being a smart shopper."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He really liked the large keys and the very readable screen. The only down side is the transmission of messages can take hours and sometimes up to a day. Perhaps it has to do with the service in his area. Overall it was a great gift and now he can communicate with his ten children. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To determine whether the review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light, let's evaluate the content of the review: 1. The review begins by mentioning the gifting of a Mailbug to an elderly parent, which implies that the product is suitable for older individuals. 2. The parent liked the large keys and the readable screen, indicating that the design of the product is user-friendly, especially for the elderly. 3. The only negative aspect mentioned in the review is the slow transmission of messages. However, the reviewer speculates that it might be due to the service in the area, suggesting that the issue may not be directly related to the product. 4. As a result of using the Mailbug, the father is now able to communicate with his ten children, which showcases the product's value for improved communication. Taking these points into consideration, it can be concluded that the review depicts the product in a mostly flattering light, as it emphasizes the benefits and user-friendliness of the Mailbug while acknowledging a potential, location-based issue with message transmission speeds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A USCG pilot and his winchman Haig answer an SOS call at sea and arrive at a derelict schooner, the Requite. Haig lowers himself to the ship, where he finds three dead bodies along with one survivor, Eva, cowering in the cabin. As the pilot attempts to retrieve Haig and Eva with a rescue basket, the line breaks, plunging the two into the ocean. After they swim back to the boat, the pilot informs Haig that he must return to base because his fuel is borderline. Eva and Haig spend the night on the boat, during which time she recounts the story of the storm that killed everyone else aboard. She explains to him that the strange events began soon after they found a priest drifting in the ocean, apparently a survivor of a disaster. Then, she tells Haig of the violent storm that caused all of the freakish deaths on the boat. One man was hurled through a hatch; one is hanging from the ship's mast; another vanished before her eyes; and a fourth man is in an aft compartment, floating in the air. Eva attributes the deaths to supernatural causes, but Haig has a practical explanation for everything, including the man who appears to be floating in the air. Early the next morning, the pilot returns along with the Coast Guard cutter Venturous. Haig and Eva are transferred from the Requite to the deck of the Venturous, where they board the helicopter for the flight back to Miami. At the same time, Coast Guard personnel from the Venturous investigate the wrecked schooner. The story takes a bizarre turn when the Venturous' captain calls Haig to tell him that what they found on the ship was not what Haig reported.

The powerful sound of the chant, which aimed to bring people together and foster a connection with their faith, was suddenly overshadowed by the harsh discord of the protest, which held no regard for the sanctity of the space or the solemnity of the worship. The protest's loud nature was undoubtedly deliberate, designed to gain attention and make a statement, regardless of the offense it would cause to the devout worshippers. As a result, the church's harmonious environment was broken, and the sense of unity and collective spirituality that had been so carefully cultivated was disrupted as well. Additionally, the intrusive noise exacerbated an already contentious situation, further driving a wedge between the protesters and the religious community. Instead of facilitating dialogue and promoting understanding, the deafening protest only served to harden the resolve of both groups, making it increasingly difficult for any form of communication or reconciliation to take place. Ironically, the disruptive volume of the protest also detracted from the efficacy of the chanting, a religious practice intended to deepen the connection between the congregation and their deity. As the soothing melodies of the chants were drowned out by the cacophony of the protest, the spiritual experience became fraught with tension and hostility, leaving the worshippers feeling unsettled and unable to focus on the sacred words they had come to recite. Moreover, the well-being and emotional state of the attendees were indelibly affected by the auditory onslaught. The sudden barrage of sound left many individuals feeling anxious and disoriented, unable to respond or react appropriately to the situation at hand. The clashing of the reverent chanting and the offensive protest highlighted a striking contrast in values, as the former sought to bring peace and enlightenment, while the latter espoused discord and provocation. In conclusion, the offensive protest within the church interrupted the religious chanting primarily due to its excessive loudness, which significantly disrupted the serene atmosphere and the emotional and spiritual experiences of the churchgoers. As the sacred space was violated by the harsh sounds of the protest, it became increasingly challenging for both the religious community and the protesters to find common ground and engage in meaningful dialogue, greatly diminishing the possibility for any productive resolution to the situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If A count of the languages spoken all over India, leaving out the dialects, comes to 1,652, written in 13 different alphabets., can we conclude that \\"Only 4 languages are spoken.\\"? *yes. *it is not possible to tell. *no.","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Only 4 languages are spoken\\" in India. The statement provided indicates that there are 1,652 languages spoken all over India, excluding dialects. These languages are written using 13 different alphabets. This shows the linguistic diversity of India, which is known for its rich cultural and linguistic heritage. India is home to multiple language families, such as Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Austroasiatic, and Tibeto-Burman, among others. Some of the widely spoken languages in India include Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Malayalam, Kannada, Oriya, Punjabi, Assamese, and many more. Each of these languages has its own literature, history, and cultural significance. The mention of 4 languages might likely be a confusion with the concept of \\"The Four Classical Languages of India,\\" which are Sanskrit, Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada. These languages hold significant historical and cultural value in India. However, it is important to understand that these four classical languages do not represent the totality of languages spoken in India, as there are numerous other languages spoken by millions of people across the country. Furthermore, India's constitution recognizes 22 official languages under the Eighth Schedule, which includes languages such as Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Bodo, Santhali, Maithili, and Dogri. This highlights the importance of linguistic diversity in India and demonstrates that the country cannot be represented by only four languages. In conclusion, the statement that \\"Only 4 languages are spoken\\" in India is incorrect and does not capture the vast linguistic diversity of the country. The provided information, which states that there are 1,652 languages spoken in India, is a more accurate representation of India's linguistic diversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can mix it with a small amount of warm water to get it ready. Here's the step-by-step justification for choosing option 2: Step 1: Understanding yeast Yeast is a living organism that ferments sugars, releasing carbon dioxide and alcohol as by-products. This fermentation helps bread rise and gives it its characteristic texture. Step 2: Assessing the options Option 1 suggests mixing yeast with warm vinegar. Vinegar is acidic, which can negatively affect yeast's ability to ferment. This may result in poor rising of the dough. Option 2 suggests mixing yeast with warm water. Warm water helps activate the yeast by providing an ideal environment for the yeast to dissolve and begin fermentation. Step 3: Choosing the best option Option 2 is the better choice because it provides a more suitable environment for yeast activation and fermentation, resulting in the desired rising of the dough for the recipe."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

What is the name of the person that Princess Louise-Hippolyte succeeded? Answer the above question based on the context below: Antoine's marriage to Marie of Lorraine was unhappy and yielded only two daughters. Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law. After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be...

He selects the seasoned Captain Jonas, the lovely and witty anthropologist Sarah, eccentric biologist Dr. Walter Baines, an intrepid photographer Ivy, a charming yet rugged survival expert named Jack, and a confident navigator named Pamela. Together, the team embarks on a daring adventure, sailing across treacherous waters in search of the mysterious island. Upon arrival, what they find exceeds their wildest dreams - a tropical paradise teeming with unique creatures and a hidden indigenous tribe who have never encountered Western civilization. Gilligan is determined to document their lives and practices, convinced that this is the story that will launch his career to new heights. However, things take a sinister turn when they discover that there is a rival group of journalists from a competitive news organization who have also found their way to the island on a similar mission, putting their own twisted spin on the truth and seeking to exploit the indigenous tribe and the island's natural resources for their benefit. As tensions rise between the two groups, they each rush against time to publish their stories first. Meanwhile, Gilligan forms a deep bond with the island's inhabitants and takes it upon himself to protect their way of life from the ruthless ambitions of the visiting outsiders. The climax of the film comes when Gilligan's team must work together to expose the ruthless tactics of their rivals, educate the world about the island's wonders without exploiting its people, and ultimately save the island paradise from the ever-looming threat of human greed. In the end, \\"The Jungle Tribune\\" speaks to the power of responsible journalism and the lengths one investigative reporter will go to protect not only his story but the very people at the heart of it, all while forging a newfound respect for the world and the diverse cultures that inhabit it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome.

Write a title for this article: A private rocket successfully sent a capsule full of cargo zipping toward the International Space Station in a first of its kind delivery for NASA, but couldn't deliver on job No. 2: putting a commercial satellite into the correct orbit. One of nine engines on Space X company's Falcon 9 rocket failed Sunday 79 seconds after launch because of a pressure loss. The engine didn't explode, but it did start a series of events that meant another company's private satellite is not in the place it is needed. The main mission for the Falcon launch — delivering half a ton of science and food supplies toward the space station — is still on track with a docking of the cargo-laden Dragon capsule scheduled for Wednesday. SpaceX on Monday said the ship's flight computer calculated a new path to the station for the capsule. It is the first of a dozen supply runs under a mega-contract with NASA. \\"Falcon 9 did exactly what it was designed to do,\\" the California based SpaceX said. \\"Like the Saturn V, which experienced engine loss on two flights, Falcon 9 is designed to handle an engine out situation and still complete its mission.\\" But not all of its mission. The original plan was for Falcon to fire its second stage engines after Dragon left and then deploy an industrial communications satellite into orbit for Orbcomm of Dulles, Va. Because this is a new resupply ship for the space station, NASA and its international partners had set detailed safety rules in advance for Falcon, even though the engine failure was far from the station. And those rules prevent SpaceX from firing its second stage engines, Orbcomm said in a statement. The satellite is in a lower orbit and engineers are trying to figure out how to boost it, Orbcomm said. This was the first of 18 satellites that Orbcomm had hired SpaceX to deliver. The satellites help in two-way communications for companies to track their heavy equipment across the world. The company wouldn't respond to questions about the cost of the satellite or launch services. Harvard University astronomer Jonathan McDowell, who tracks launches worldwide, noticed the problem for hours before either company acknowledged that the satellite was in the wrong orbit. Even though SpaceX was congratulating itself after the launch, McDowell said: \\"We can't say that it was a perfect launch.\\" Seth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears Title:","completion":"\\"SpaceX's Mixed Success: Falcon 9 Mission Delivers Cargo to ISS, Fails to Position Commercial Satellite\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, he sees a news report about the arrest of Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), a young altar boy from Kentucky with a severe stutter, who is accused of brutally murdering the beloved Archbishop Rushman (Stanley Anderson). Vail jumps at the chance to represent the young man pro bono. During his meetings at the county jail with Aaron, Vail comes to believe that his client is innocent, much to the chagrin of the prosecutor (and Vail's former lover), Janet Venable (Laura Linney). As the murder trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt State's attorney John Shaughnessy (John Mahoney), have lost millions of dollars in real estate investments due to a decision by the Archbishop not to develop on certain church lands. The Archbishop received numerous death threats as a result. Vail makes a search of the Archbishop's apartment and finds a videotape of Stampler being forced to perform in a sexual act with another altar boy and a girl named Linda (Azalea Davila). Vail is now in a bind: Introducing this evidence would make Stampler more sympathetic to the jury, but it would also give his client a motive for the murder, which Venable is unable to establish. When Vail confronts his client and accuses him of having lied, Stampler breaks down crying and suddenly transforms into a new persona: a violent sociopath who calls himself \\"Roy\\" who confesses to the murder of the Archbishop and throws Vail against a wall of his jail cell.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Between the two phrases, \\"suggest me some good songs\\" and \\"suggest to me some good songs,\\" the grammatically correct phrase is \\"suggest some good songs to me.\\" However, \\"suggest to me some good songs\\" is also acceptable, albeit less common. In the preferred construction, the pronoun \\"me\\" follows the preposition \\"to,\\" which comes after the object \\"some good songs.\\" Regarding your second question, it appears that you value proper grammar and feel a stronger connection with individuals who possess good grammatical skills. This preference may stem from a variety of factors, such as being raised in an environment where proper grammar was emphasized or believing that good grammar is an indication of intelligence or mastery of a language. It is completely normal for people to have different preferences when it comes to communication styles, which can include grammar usage. It is important to remember, however, that language proficiency is only one aspect of a person's knowledge or intelligence, and it is beneficial to be open to connecting with people who may not have a strong grasp of grammar, as they may possess other valuable skills or qualities. The two questions you posed are inquiring about different pieces of information. The first question is focused on determining the grammatical correctness of two phrases related to song suggestions. The second question is introspective, as it pertains to your preferences in valuing grammatical skills in people you associate with and seeks to understand why you feel this way. While both questions share a common theme regarding the use and importance of grammar, the information you seek in each question is distinct and separate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

Ulmer's Detour begins in a diner somewhere in the middle of nowhere as Al Roberts (Tom Neal) ruminates in voice over about his life and what has lead him to this place in time. Hes got a tale to tell and theres a reason because it has taught Al something about Fate. His experiences have left Al irascible and he argues sullenly with the waitress, the diner manager and a trucker who drops a nickel in a juke box and plays the song that Al and his girlfriend called their song. Als problem becomes more apparent as he explains the events that have brought him here. In flashback he talks about his relationship with his singer girlfriend Sue (Claudia Drake) as he accompanied her on piano in a New York club. When she leaves for fame and fortune in Los Angeles Al is lonely and decides to hitch hike to the coast to be with her. He accepts a ride from good-time-Charlie Charles Haskell Jr. (Edmund MacDonald). During their drive Haskell tells Al a little about himself, relating a story about deep scratches he has on his hand that he received when he picked up a woman who shunned his advances. When Haskell suffers an attack and dies, Roberts, fearing that he will be accused of the death takes on the man's identification and begins driving the car himself. At a gas station Al picks up Vera (Ann Savage), who blurts out, \\"What did you do with the body?\\" It turns out that Vera had accepted a ride from Haskell earlier and she is the one who has given him the scratches on his hand.

The most important location will be in a spot with drainage holes. The best option for reducing obstructions is under a tall, tall fence, either chalky or concrete. - This option focuses on drainage, but the mention of placing the plant under a tall fence might be counterproductive as it could block sunlight. 2). You can grow them anywhere where the ground drains a lot of sunlight! Find a spot that gets at least 10 or 15 hours of sun a day. Black eyed susan plants like to alternate between full sun and shade in areas with less sun. - This option emphasizes sunlight, but the phrasing \\"ground drains a lot of sunlight\\" is incorrect. It also contradicts the initial information stating they prefer full sun but can grow in partial or bright shade. 3). To grow black-eyed susan flowers, be sure to plant from seed. This is especially important for African violets that will simply take root. - This option seems unrelated to the previous sentences and talks about planting from seed, and also mentions African violets, which is irrelevant to black-eyed susan flowers. 4). Plant your susans in well-draining, rich soil. While they don't necessarily care about the ph of their soil, they do prefer organically rich soil that drains quickly. - This option focuses on soil preferences and matches well with the earlier statements about black-eyed susan flowers not being particular about soil type or pH.

Question: Where was Sam drinking wine? Movie title: Lake Dead Movie plot: Three sisters, Brielle, Kelli, and Sam, are on a college break. They discover that their grandfather has just died and he has left them a motel in his will. Their father, John, tries to persuade them not to go, but the sisters ignore him and head off, accompanied by their friends: Tanya, Ben, Bill, and Bill's girlfriend, Amy. Sam is the first to arrive, and while drinking wine in Room 6, two inbreds forcefully enter and attack Sam, where with a collection of duct tape, an iron bar, and an axe, they bind Sam's legs with the tape, place the iron bar beside her ankles, and use the axe head to force the bar through both her ankles. Afterwards, the three are in a boat, where the inbreds tie a badly beaten Sam's legs to a concrete block, and dump her into the water, where she is still alive as the concrete block pulls her beneath the water, where she drowns. The rest drive to the motel and meet the caretaker, an old lady who appears kind. After finding a lake on their property, the group of friends take a swim, not noticing that Sam's dead body is floating in the lake beneath them. After the swim, the friends return to their trailer, where they set up a small campsite. Bill and Tanya go out to the woods to get some firewood, and end up having sex (much to the chagrin of Amy). After encounters with large, strange-looking, unkempt men, the friends are terrified. Bill, Tanya, and Amy are butchered, while the remaining friends escape but are picked up by a mysterious, pushy cop. He tricks them into coming back to the motel where everything slowly falls into place. It is later revealed that the cop and caretaker are all a part of the evil scheme to make Brielle and Kelli a part of their devious plans.

(CNN) -- Two Kenyan aid workers who had been held by the al Qaeda-linked militant group Al-Shabaab since 2011 have been rescued near Somalia's border with Kenya, the African Union Mission in Somalia said Friday. The rescue was carried out on the outskirts of Dhobley town in Somalia by peacekeepers for the mission, known by the acronym AMISOM, who were working with Somali forces, AMISOM said in a news release. One of the rescued, James Kiarie Gichoi, was working for Care International when he was kidnapped near the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya. The other, Daniel Njuguna Wanyoike, was working as a driver's helper for a company contracted by the aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres when he was kidnapped in Afmadow, a nearby town in Somalia. Both men were receiving treatment Friday at an AMISOM medical facility in nearby Dhobley, Somalia, and were expected to be repatriated to Nairobi, Kenya. AMISOM forces working with the Somali National Army have mounted an offensive that has liberated 10 towns that were among Al-Shabaab's strongholds, said AMISOM, the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Al-Shabaab, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. In 2012, the two groups effectively merged, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. Al-Shabaab hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, but has launched attacks in other countries as well.

The paragraph further specifies that Duke made his debut in 1983, which seems to be aligned with the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero toyline relaunch that began the same year. This relaunch included an accompanying Marvel comic book series and later a Sunbow-produced animated series.

Watching TV does not automatically imply seeking out or expecting adult content. - Boredom: While some people might find certain TV content boring, the primary intention of watching TV is not to experience boredom. People typically watch TV to pass the time or relax, and they usually try to choose content that interests or entertains them. - Get fat: Although watching TV for extended periods and leading a sedentary lifestyle can contribute to weight gain, people do not watch TV with the expectation of getting fat. It is important to find a balance between sedentary activities, like watching TV, and engaging in physical exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle. - Sadness: TV content may sometimes provoke feelings of sadness or sympathy in the audience, but this is not the main goal. Many shows aim to evoke a range of emotions to create an engaging and immersive experience for the viewer. People generally watch TV to lift their spirits, relax, or enjoy themselves, rather than seeking out sadness.

The violent arena of domestic abuse litigation has grown a bit more volatile here, now that a judge has decided to hold two women in contempt of court for returning to men who had been ordered to stay away from them. \\"You can't have it both ways,\\" said Judge Megan Lake Thornton of Fayette County District Court in recently fining two women 100 and 200 respectively for obtaining protective orders forbidding their partners from contacting them, then relenting and contacting the men. Ruling that the order was mutually binding, Judge Thornton also cited the men for contempt. \\"It drives me nuts when people just decide to do whatever they want,\\" said Judge Thornton, who is experienced in the state's thick domestic abuse docket, which produces close to 30,000 emergency protective orders a year. Kentucky officials say there is a virtual epidemic of abusive relationships in the state. Judge Thornton's ruling has alarmed advocates for battered women, who plan to appeal it. The advocates say the finding goes beyond existing law and is unrealistic because some renewed contacts often prove unavoidable in domestic abuse cases, which involve economic and family dependency and other complications of daily living. The state office on domestic violence has pointedly agreed, warning that the ruling could cause abused women to hesitate in bringing their plight before the courts for fear of being chastised for their trouble. \\"The reality is it's easy to say they should never have contact,\\" said Sherry Currens, executive director of the Kentucky Domestic Violence Association, an advocacy and legal protection group. \\"But we're talking about people in long-term relationships. They may have children in common. It's pretty hard to say, \`Never speak again.' People have financial difficulties. They may love the partner. It's not an easy thing.\\" But Judge Thornton declared in court, \\"When these orders are entered, you don't just do whatever you damn well please and ignore them.\\" The ruling stunned Cindra Walker, the lawyer for the two women, who is with Central Kentucky Legal Services, which represents many of the thousands of indigent women caught in abusive relationships. \\"For over five years, I've been in court practically every day on these abuse cases,\\" Ms. Walker said, \\"and I've never before had a victim threatened with contempt.\\" Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are two of the reasons Sherry Currens gives for people violating protective orders?\\" is \\"Financial difficulties\\"?

Here's the breakdown: - Start with the first operation, 6683 - 53, which equals 6630. - Next, add 3081 to the result, 6630 + 3081 = 9711 - Add another 7107 to that total, 9711 + 7107 = 16818 - Add 6531 to the result, 16818 + 6531 = 23349 - Subtract 9134 from that total, 23349 - 9134 = 14215 - Finally, subtract 345 from the result, 14215 - 345 = 13870 So, when you translate the operations to English and follow the arithmetic declarations, you obtain the final answer 13870."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Last weekend marked my third excursion to LVNV, and Planet Hollywood, with a close group of friends, all of us travelling from the DFW, TX area. Thankfully, this will be my last to Planet Hollywood...and I'm not alone several of our group agree with this sentiment. Two separate experiences that we're horribly handled and concluded our business with your hotel: 1. During our stay, my wife went to take a bag up to our room on the 23rd floor. She rode the elevator stopping several times along the way, but discovered when she got to the room...the key card didn't work. She rode the elevator to the lobby, again stopping along the way. Went to the front desk and was told she would have to wait in the check-in/check-out line for someone to help. When she told the front desk person she just needed a key, they huffily told her to give them the key. They looked up the room and told her she wasn't on the room registry and they couldn't let her in the room. Sadly, they had taken her ID at check-in and we assumed they had added her. So, my wife comes and gets me. I go down to the front desk. Once again they tried to direct me to the check-in/check-out line. I refused and told them I was down to see the Manager. I can't make this part up...they directed me to another line for people waiting to see the Manager about complaints. I told them I wanted to see the Manager immediately. The Front Desk person went and got the Supervisor. The Supervisor proceeded to tell me that they had a \\"Policy\\" that additional guests had to be registered to the room. I explained that the policy shouldn't be used as a cover for poor customer service. My wife's name is the same as mine, her ID as presented showed the same address, and she was with me at check-in and provided her ID...they had failed to follow their policy and subsequently burdened us with the failure. The Supervisor just kept restating it was policy. As I walked away, the Security Guard at the desk pulled me aside and suggested he could go get the Manager to discuss the situation, he didn't feel that the Supervisor was making the situation better. I told him I would wait. The Manager, Roberto, came out and I explained the story to him. He agreed that the failure was theirs and made sure my wife was on the room and reset the key card. He apologized and offered to remove the resort fees from our bill...I told him I wasn't looking for that, I was frustrated that my wife was treated poorly. Roberto stated he wanted to do it and he apologized again that there was an issue. I thought the problem was solved... 2. When we checked in we had a voucher for a couple of free nights. This was sent to one of our higher rolling group members (under the friends and family program) who offered it to us for this trip. We had decided there was no big issue if it wasn't used, we would simply pass it along to the next member of our group. So, we asked at check-in if it would be honored and we were reassured that it would be. We asked again before we left the desk and we were told it was already applied. We found out at check-out that it was not applied. Once again someone went and found Roberto. This time Roberto was the failure. Not only had he not applied what he had offered in our previous interaction, but when we told him about the voucher he told us there was no proof it had been presented, indicating we were not being honest. Since the voucher was kept by the front desk person at check-in we couldn't even pass it along, it was completely wasted. He ended up removing one day's worth of resort fees (22.50 versus his offering prior to remove them all) and told us there was nothing else he could do. Again, I wasn't looking for special dispensation, it was offered at the outset...My problem was the way it was dealt with and that what was offered wasn't honored. We are in our forties, we have some simple expectations you could learn from: 1.) Reasonable accommodations at a reasonable price point...5 nights @ 150/Night; AC didn't work, room wasn't cleaned, and we paid 22.50 per night in resort fees for amenities we didn't use. 2.) Customer Service is exceptional...in this case it wasn't even close. We're not twenty year olds on spring break...Service means something to us. If you want us to stay with you twice per year, prove it. 3.) If you or your employees say something is going to happen make sure it does...if there is a question about whether or not it happened, give us the benefit of the doubt. This trip there were nine in our group staying with you, we are all gamblers to varying degrees. Several hundred dollars to several thousand dollars are risked in your Casino by each of us on every trip. This trip, our losses to your casino ranged from 220 - 7500. We have no issues losing if we're having fun and are taken care of (ie. treat us well). However, we are unified in this...Treat any one of us poorly and you lose us all.

Premise: 3,645 to develop a domestic violence training program for local police departments, led by a victim's advocacy trainer; the goal of these mini-workshops will be to ensure that local police departments consistently adhere to proper PFA protocol. Hypothesis: It costs less then 1000 dollars to develop this training program. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise explicitly states that the cost to develop the domestic violence training program is 3,645. On the other hand, the hypothesis proposes that it costs less than 1,000 to develop this training program. The training program, as described in the premise, is designed to be led by a victim's advocacy trainer and aims to ensure local police departments consistently adhere to proper PFA (protection from abuse) protocol. Since the given cost in the premise is 3,645, and it states that this amount will be used for developing the program, the hypothesis of it costing less than 1,000 is not supported by the given information in the premise. Additionally, it's important to consider that the development of a comprehensive training program, such as the one described in the premise, may involve various costs. These can include hiring and paying the victim's advocacy trainer, creating and distributing training materials, organizing workshops, and any potential administration fees. All these expenses would need to be covered by the budget allocated for the development of the program. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the development of this domestic violence training program costs less than 1,000 is not supported or entailed by the premise. The premise itself clearly states that a figure of 3,645 has been allocated for this purpose. Hence, the hypothesis contradicts the premise, and it can be logically concluded that the cost of developing this training program is not less than 1,000 according to the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Such special dialects, or jargon, are necessary in technical discussion of any kind.

Thousands of these technical terms are very properly included in every large dictionary, yet, as a whole, _ Different professions, however, differ widely in the character of their special vocabularies. In trades and handicrafts and other professions, such as farming and fishing, that have occupied great numbers of men from remote times, the technical vocabulary is very old. It consists largely of native words, or of borrowed words that have worked themselves into the very fiber of our language, hence, though highly technical in many particulars, these vocabularies are more familiar in sound, and more generally understood than most other technicalities. The special dialects of law, medicine, and philosophy have also become pretty familiar to cultivated person, and have contributed much to the popular vocabulary. Yet, every profession still possesses a large body of technical terms that remain essentially foreign, even to educated speech. And the proportion has been much increased in the last fifty years, particularly in the various departments of natural and political sciences and in the mechanic arts. So new terms are coined with the greatest freedom, and abandoned with indifference when they have served their turn.

Smiling at the scene of a fatal bus crash in which 36 people died has led to a safety official losing his job. After photos emerged on the internet of Yang Dacai grinning on a highway in Yan'an, northern Shaanxi, province officials said in a statement they had stripped him of all his official duties for 'serious wrongdoing.' His jovial expression on August 26 was seen as unsympathetic and caused mass public outrage.

Junior officials appeared nervous when they were updating me on the situation,' he said to defend himself, reported the BBC. 'I was trying to get them to relax a little, so maybe, in an unguarded moment, I got a little too relaxed myself.' Yang then found himself targeted by netizens when photos emerged of him wearing 11 luxury wristwatches.
