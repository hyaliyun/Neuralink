Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The presence of bats in a closed space would likely not have a significant effect on less extensive flooding. In this scenario, the bats are not directly or indirectly impacting any step of the flood process. The process of flooding, as detailed in your question, primarily involves water accumulation and distribution. Bats, being small, flying mammals, are generally not capable of interfering with the progression of a flood in a meaningful way. They would be more affected by the flood rather than impacting the flood itself. To break it down further, let's analyze each step of the flood process: 1. There is a lot of rain or a dam breaks: Bats have no direct influence on either of these situations. 2. Water levels of a river or lake get higher: Again, bats cannot control water levels or contribute significantly to their rise. 3. Water builds up on the ground: Bats cannot prevent or cause water to accumulate on the ground. 4. Water covers streets: The presence of bats does not affect the flooding of streets. 5. Water gets deep in some places: Bats do not have the ability to influence water depth. 6. Water goes into houses and other buildings: While bats may be able to fly in and out of buildings, they cannot impact the entry of water into houses or other structures during a flood. 7. The rain stops or the dam is repaired: Bats have no control over natural events like rain stopping, nor can they participate in the repair process of a dam. 8. Water flows into streams: Bats are not involved in the water flow into streams. 9. The rest of the floodwater evaporates: Bats have no impact on the evaporation process of floodwater. Based on this analysis, the presence of bats in a closed space has no notable perturbation on the flood process, whether the flooding is less extensive or more severe. Thus, bats do not directly or indirectly impact any of the steps mentioned in the flood process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She had a marvellous drey high up a spruce tree, carved out long ago by a woodpecker, and since extended into a two-chambered home full of bright things. The journey along the sky-road to her drey did not take long. When Patch looked inside, he saw a hundred colours glittering in the sunlight, shining from bits of metal and glass set into Silver's walls and floor. But his mother was not there. He could tell by the faintness of her smell that no squirrel had been here in some time. There were two faint traces of scent, several days old; that of Silver, and that of another squirrel, a musky scent that Patch did not recognize. A scent that made his tail stiffen as if danger was near. Patch stared into his mother's empty drey for a moment. It wasn't normal for a squirrel to abandon her drey for days, not in the middle of winter. And he hadn't seen Silver for three days. Not since all the acorns had disappeared from the earth. Patch ran back to his own tree, and then to the maple tree next door, to his brother Tuft's drey. He ran very fast. He was hungrier than ever, and he was beginning to be very worried. He was relieved when he looked into Tuft's drey and found it occupied. Tuft himself was not present, but Brighteyes was, and their babies, and it was clear from the smells that Tuft had only just departed. \\"Hello, Patch,\\" Brighteyes said weakly. \\"Would you like to come in?\\" Patch entered. Brighteyes was curled up with her babies in the drey's deepest, warmest corner. The last time Patch had visited, a week ago, this had been a den of noise and chaos, with all Brighteyes' four babies running and jumping and playfighting. Today they lay weakly beside Brighteyes, and the once-shining eyes from which their mother had taken her name were dim and clouded. Why Patch's tail felt stiffen? A.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: We were moving to a new state after my husband had been out of work for many months and we had no money. In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away. We were able to call a friend and get a ride, leaving our broken car behind, but not before the couple gave us food and water for our journey. One week later, this dear sweet couple pulled our car all the way to our place and refused to take anything in return, except for us to pay it forward-and we have, and will continue to do it forever.

Orion is one of the most beautiful of all constellations, and one of the easiest to find. It looks like a large (slightly twisted) rectangle high in winter's south-southeastern sky. Two of the brightest stars in the evening sky lie at opposite corners of the rectangle: bright orange-red Betelgeuse at the northeastern corner (upper left in the photo) and even brighter Rigel at the southwest (lower right in the photo). Betelgeuse is at least 300 times the Sun's diameter, and perhaps much more. It puts out about 100,000 times more energy than the Sun does. When Betelgeuse dies, it will create a fireball that will briefly outshine billions of normal stars. Betelgeuse is a red giant and Rigel is a blue giant.

What is the final step of the following process: - A star forms - The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula","completion":"After going through the process you have described, the final step for the star is to become a white dwarf. Here's a summary of the entire process: 1. A star forms from the gravitational collapse of a molecular/nuclear cloud consisting mostly of hydrogen. 2. The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star, meaning it has less than roughly 1.4 times the mass of the Sun (below the Chandrasekhar limit), and thus it follows the life cycle of a low-to-medium mass star. 3. As the star ages, it begins to exhaust its core hydrogen, and subsequently switches to the fusion of helium into heavier elements such as carbon and oxygen. 4. The star expands and becomes a red giant due to the increased energy output and pressure from the helium fusion at its core. 5. A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star since the core nuclear reactions no longer produce enough energy to counter gravity. 6. The outer layers of the star are ejected, creating a nebula, also known as a planetary nebula, which is an expanding shell of gas and dust illuminated by the remaining core. The final step (7) is when the remaining core cools and contracts, ultimately forming a white dwarf. A white dwarf is a dense, compact, and hot stellar remnant composed mainly of carbon and oxygen. It no longer undergoes nuclear fusion reactions and thus cools gradually over time, radiating its residual heat into space. Over a very long period, on the order of billions of years, the white dwarf will continue to cool and eventually become a black dwarf, an essentially invisible and very cold object. However, the universe is not old enough for any black dwarfs to have formed yet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose departure from the band caused another band member to leave? Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swanö in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

When measuring your shirt size, it is crucial to remain relaxed and maintain a normal breathing pattern, as your body should be in a comfortable position to ensure accurate measurements. Here, we will provide a detailed process on how to measure your shirt size correctly: 1. Neck Circumference: Measure around your neck, at the point where your collar usually sits. Place two fingers between the tape measure and your neck to leave some breathing space. Note the neck size. 2. Chest Circumference: Wrap the tape measure around the fullest part of your chest, under your arms, and across the shoulder blades. Ensure that the tape is level and parallel to the ground. Exhale normally when taking this measurement and note the chest size. 3. Waist Circumference: Measure around your natural waistline, which is typically located just above your navel and below your ribcage. Keep the tape measure snug but not too tight, and ensure that it is parallel to the ground. Exhale normally and note the waist size. 4. Hips Circumference: Measure around the fullest part of your hips, which is usually around the point where your hip bones are most prominent. Ensure that the tape measure is parallel to the ground and level. Note the hip size. 5. Shoulder width: Stand straight with your arms relaxed at your sides. Have someone else measure the distance between the outer edges of your shoulders, from one shoulder bone to the other. Note the shoulder width. 6. Sleeve Length: Measure from the outer edge of your shoulder bone, down the outer side of your arm, past the elbow, and to your wrist bone. You can bend your arm slightly to determine the proper length for a comfortable fit. Note the sleeve length. 7. Shirt Length: Measure from the highest point of your shoulder, where the shoulder seam would sit, down to the desired length on your body. This is often past your waistline and should be long enough so the shirt can be tucked in or worn out comfortably. Note the shirt length. Once you have all these measurements recorded, you can use them to find your ideal shirt size while shopping or when tailoring a custom shirt.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 10180 = -1603*p - 18674 for p.","completion":"Alright, little buddy! We are going to solve this math problem step by step. Our goal is to find the value of \\"p\\". Here is the equation we have: 10180 = -1603 * p - 18674 First, let's add 18674 to both sides of the equation. This will help get rid of the -18674 on the right side. 10180 + 18674 = -1603 * p - 18674 + 18674 Now, it looks like: 28854 = -1603 * p Next, we need to get \\"p\\" all by itself. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -1603. 28854 / -1603 = (-1603 * p) / -1603 After we do this, we have: p = -18 So, the answer is p = -18!

Plot title: Body Double Movie plot: Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a struggling actor who has lost his role as a vampire in a low-budget horror movie after his claustrophobia thwarts shooting. After returning home to discover his girlfriend cheating on him, he is left without a place to stay. At a method acting class he meets Sam (Gregg Henry) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's friend has left town temporarily and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the Hollywood Hills. During the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially ecstatic about one feature: a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle (Deborah Shelton), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Sam has even set up a telescope which Scully cannot resist using voyeuristically to watch her. One night he sees Gloria being abused by a boyfriend. When she goes shopping the next day, Scully decides to follow her. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \\"Indian,\\" a man he had noticed watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows her to a seaside motel where apparently Gloria has been stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach the Indian suddenly snatches her purse. Scully tries to pursue him but in a nearby tunnel his claustrophobia restrains him and Gloria walks him out of it. They begin to impulsively and passionately kiss before she retreats. That night Scully is again watching through the telescope when the Indian returns. The man is seen breaking into Gloria's home. Scully races to save her but is attacked by Gloria's vicious dog. Gloria is brutally murdered by the Indian with a huge handheld drill. Chemosphere, the ultramodern house used in Body Double Scully is then left to alert the police, who assume it was simply a fumbled robbery. Detective McLean (Guy Boyd), however, becomes suspicious of him after finding a pair of Gloria's panties in his pocket. Although... My question: What fear does the actor have? The answer is:","completion":"The actor, Jake Scully, has claustrophobia, a fear of being in confined places.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Mystique (Raven Darkholme) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by artist David Cockrum and writer Chris Claremont, she first appeared in the comic book Ms. Marvel #16, published in 1978. Mystique is a member of a subspecies of humanity known as mutants, who are born with superhuman abilities. Mystique is a shapeshifter who can mimic the appearance and voice of any person with exquisite precision, and her natural appearance includes blue skin and yellow eyes. Mystique becomes the adoptive mother of the four-year-old girl Rogue. Rogue had run away from her home in rural Caldecott County, Mississippi. The girl was living alone in a wooded area, brandishing a shotgun and trusting no one, when Mystique found her. Destiny foresees that Rogue will be important to them and Mystique seeks her out, gains her trust, and takes her in. She and Destiny raise the girl, and Mystique grows to be very protective of her. Mystique, as Raven Darkholme, rises rapidly through the United States Civil Service to the trusted position of Deputy Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the United States Department of Defense. This position gives her access to military secrets and advanced weaponry, both of which she uses for her own criminal and subversive purposes. In this position, she attempts the theft of the Centurion weaponry from S.H.I.E.L.D. She also beat Ms. Marvel's lover Michael Barnett to death, and sought to kill Ms. Marvel. To help her in her criminal activities, Mystique organizes her own incarnation of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, consisting of herself, Avalanche, the Blob, Destiny, and Pyro. The Brotherhood attempts to assassinate Senator Robert Kelly, a notoriously anti-mutant politician. The X-Men thwart the assassination attempt, and all of the Brotherhood save Mystique herself are incarcerated. Rogue is trained by Mystique and eventually joins the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Her mutant power is the ability to absorb the memories, personality, and skills or powers of whomever she touches. To free the other members of the Brotherhood, Mystique concocts a plan involving Rogue absorbing the powers of Ms. Marvel and the Avengers. Though the plan is successful, the Avengers ultimately defeat the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, capturing all of them except Rogue and Mystique. Moreover, Rogue finds that she has absorbed Ms. Marvel's memories, personality, and powers permanently. In a further humiliation, a confrontation at the Pentagon ends with Mystique being defeated and turned over to the authorities by a powerless Ms. Marvel. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants eventually escape, and battle against Dazzler. In an act of revenge against Mystique, Mastermind unbalances Rogue's psyche with the one she absorbed from Ms. Marvel, which prompts her to defect to the X-Men. Because Rogue left without a word, Mystique assumes that Professor X, the X-Men's mentor, brainwashed her. The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants accordingly launches an attempt to kill Professor X. Rogue stops Mystique, and explains that she joined the X-Men because Professor X, as the world's most powerful telepath, is her best hope of healing for her fragmented psyche. Mystique reluctantly relinquishes her guardianship of Rogue.

This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"Named after the iconic Copenhagen Mermaid who is angry about the destruction being caused by climate change, the Angry Mermaid Award winner was decided by a public poll. Read the story of the Angry Mermaid. The Angry Mermaid Award was an initiative launched in 2009 on the sidelines of the 15th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15) held in Copenhagen, Denmark. The award was named after the famous statue of the Little Mermaid, situated in Copenhagen's harbor, which was pictured with a scowl and a tear in her eye to signify anger and sadness over the environmental damage caused by climate change. The purpose of the award was to draw attention to corporations and organizations engaging in activities that were directly contributing to climate change and global warming. The main idea was to 'name and shame' those companies that were lobbying against climate change policies or promoting false and misleading information about their environmental impact. The winner of the Angry Mermaid Award was decided by a public poll, wherein people around the world could cast their vote for the organization they believed to be the biggest culprit. The nominees were judged based on the extent of their corporate lobbying, the level of misinformation about their environmental impact, or the destructive nature of their activities. Among those nominated in 2009 were corporations like Monsanto, Shell, and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. The unfortunate 'winner' that year was the agriculture giant, Monsanto, for its promotion of genetically modified (GM) crops as a solution to climate change. Monsanto's lobbying was seen as a false solution that hampers genuine attempts to address the problems of the climate crisis. While the Angry Mermaid Award was a symbolic gesture, it played a pivotal role in raising awareness about corporate responsibility and the need to hold companies accountable for their impact on the environment. It reiterated that climate change is not an isolated problem, but a widespread issue that involves all sectors and aspects of society. The story of the Angry Mermaid serves as a reminder of the global urgency to address climate change. It underscores the integral role that corporate responsibility and public awareness play in safeguarding our environment for future generations. As such, the legend of the Angry Mermaid continues to resonate as a significant symbol in the global fight against climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Today, we are going to learn about an exciting and fun activity that you can do at home with your grown-up's help. We will be using a few simple tools and materials to create beautiful shapes and designs with wire and beads. Are you ready to have some fun? Let's get started! First, let's talk about what we will need for this activity: 1. A piece of wire (Ask your grown-up to help you choose the right size and type.) 2. A hammer (Not too heavy, so it's easy for you to use) 3. A wooden block (This will be used to help flatten the wire.) 4. Some colorful beads (Make sure they have holes big enough for the wire to go through.) Now, let's start making our wire shapes and designs! Step 1: Flatten the Wire With a grown-up's help, place the wire on the wooden block. Use the hammer to gently hit the wire, so it becomes flat. Keep hitting it until it's nice and smooth. It's like making a pancake out of wire! Step 2: Shape the Wire Now that our wire is flat, we can start making it into different shapes. You can make circles, hearts, stars, or even your name! To do this, use your fingers or maybe ask your grown-up to help you bend the wire into the shape you want. Just be careful not to hurt your fingers! Step 3: Create a Wavy Effect To make your wire art even more interesting and fun, let's add some waves to it. With the help of your grown-up, gently bend the wire up and down like a roller coaster or ocean waves. This will give your shapes a nice 3D effect! Step 4: Add Beads Now comes the super fun part - adding colorful beads! Choose your favorite colors and slide them onto the wire. The beads will make everything look even prettier. You can arrange them in patterns or just randomly. It's up to you – use your imagination! And there you have it, little friends! You have now created your very own beautiful wire and bead art! It's amazing what you can do, isn't it? You can give your wire creations to your friends or family as a present or hang them up in your room as decorations. Remember to always ask a grown-up for help when working with tools like hammers, and have fun exploring different shapes, designs, and colors with your wire and bead art!

Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard. Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother.

We have the equation 34*n = 27*n - 42. 2. Imagine we have 34 apples times some number (n) on one side of a seesaw and 27 apples times that same number (n) minus 42 apples on the other side. 3. To get both sides equal, we need to find out how many apples (n) there should be on each side. 4. Let's start by taking 27 apples times the number (n) away from both sides to make the problem simpler. So we have: (34 - 27) * n = -42 apples. 5. Now, it looks like this: 7 * n = -42 apples. 6. To find out the number (n), ask yourself: \\"7 times what number gives us -42 apples?\\". To find that, we can divide -42 apples by 7: n = -42 ÷ 7. 7.

But when you're in the business of meeting people, you never know who you're going to meet.The film opens up with high-class, high-priced call girl Chelsea, real name Christine (Sasha Grey), on a date with a man. They come out of a movie and have dinner together. The man discusses the movie they saw and tells Chelsea about problems in his life, including a friend who keeps borrowing money. They start to make out on the man's sofa.The next morning, a personal trainer, named Chris (Chris Santos), is exercising with his client, Peter Zizzo. Zizzo asks Chris what he's doing this weekend and Zizzo implies that he wants to hang out with Chris. Back at the hotel, Chelsea is asleep in her bed next to the man she was on a date with. She gets up and walks to the bathroom. Her date wakes up and orders them some breakfast while she applies make up. They talk about the economic bailout before the date reveals that he pays Chelsea to date him. They agree to stick to cash payments. This is then followed by a group of businessmen (with Chris and his client, Zizzo among them) on a plane discussing Obama's presidential campaign and the crisis facing the economy.Earlier... Chris is running through New York City after work and arrives at his apartment as Chelsea leaves her client, Phillip, to his work.

It showcases the life of a high-end call girl in Manhattan and her experiences in the business. The movie focuses on themes like relationships, control, power dynamics, and the effects of money on people's lives. The plot revolves around Chelsea (Christine), played by Sasha Grey, who is a highly paid, upscale escort that provides a \\"girlfriend experience\\" to her clients. She believes she has her life together - running her business as she pleases, has a devoted boyfriend that accepts her lifestyle, and makes a significant amount of money. However, as she encounters different clients and situations, she comes to learn that people and circumstances aren't always predictable. The movie begins with Chelsea on a date with a man, and they discuss a movie they watched, his ongoing problems, and a friend who keeps borrowing money. As the film progresses, interwoven narratives and conversations about Obama's presidential campaign, the then ongoing financial crisis, and personal lives of different characters are presented. These elements show the contrast between Chelsea's life and the lives of her clients. This movie can be seen as an exploration of power dynamics between client and service provider, the cost of companionship, and the commodification of intimacy. As Chelsea interacts with her clients, she creates an illusion of a perfect, attentive girlfriend who offers emotional support, companionship, and sexual satisfaction. The movie raises questions about the true meaning of relationships, the potential consequences of trying to maintain emotional detachment in a inherently personal profession, and the intersection of professional and personal lives in a highly intimate business like escorting. As an investor, it is essential to consider various aspects before deciding to invest in the film proposal. Elements such as the movie's potential audience, any controversies surrounding the content, the impact on the film's marketability, and the unique traits that the movie may possess compared to other films in the same genre should be evaluated. Additionally, it's crucial to analyze the film's budget, the talent involved in the production, and the return on investment expectations. If, after evaluating these factors, you believe that \\"The Girlfriend Experience\\" offers a compelling narrative that will resonate with audiences and has the potential for strong reception and marketability, it might be worth considering investing in the proposal.

Q:Given the background: Capital flight, in economics, occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country, due to an event of economic consequence. Such events could be an increase in taxes on capital or capital holders or the government of the country defaulting on its debt that disturbs investors and causes them to lower their valuation of the assets in that country, or otherwise to lose confidence in its economic strength. This leads to a disappearance of wealth, and is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country—depreciation in a variable exchange rate regime, or a forced devaluation in a fixed exchange rate regime. This fall is particularly damaging when the capital belongs to the people of the affected country, because not only are the citizens now burdened by the loss in the economy and devaluation of their currency, but probably also, their assets have lost much of their nominal value. This leads to dramatic decreases in the purchasing power of the country's assets and makes it increasingly expensive to import goods and acquire any form of foreign facilities, e.g. medical facilities. and the situation: Nirvania continued to develop and became a first world country by 2025. Its economic strength and the accumulation of capital, led to prosperity and citizen happiness. On the other side of the river, Borania, however, decided to return to dictatorship and it's citizens and investors started to lose hope and move their capital to foreign accounts and investments. Answer the following question: Which country had lower chances of defaulting on their debt? A:","completion":"Nirvania had lower chances of defaulting on their debt. This conclusion is based on the given background and situation. Here are the step-by-step reasons for this conclusion: Step 1: Assessing economic strength Nirvania became a first world country by 2025, having a strong economy, accumulation of capital, and prosperity. In contrast, Borania returned to dictatorship, causing citizens and investors to lose hope in the country's economic future. Step 2: Evaluating capital flight Borania experienced capital flight as citizens and investors moved their assets to foreign accounts and investments. This indicates a loss of confidence in Borania's economy and could lead to a further decline in its economic conditions. On the other hand, there is no mention of capital flight in Nirvania, suggesting a stable investment environment and confidence in the nation's economic prospects. Step 3: Assessing the ability to service debt A strong economy, like Nirvania's, is typically better equipped to service its debts. Since Nirvania has a prosperous economy and a stable investment environment, the country is more likely to meet its debt obligations. In contrast, Borania is suffering from economic and political instability, leading to capital flight and potentially jeopardizing its ability to service its debt. Step 4: Comparing the chances of defaulting on debt Based on the factors considered above (economic strength, capital flight, and the ability to service debt), Nirvania has lower chances of defaulting on its debt compared to Borania. Nirvania's stronger, more stable economy and the absence of capital flight suggest a higher likelihood of meeting its debt obligations, while Borania's instability and capital flight issues indicate a greater risk of default."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Burrows The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: Vengeance Unleashed Step 1: Introduce the characters and the setting. Our protagonist, Cheng (played by an Asian action star), is an undercover cop working tirelessly to bring down the city's crime syndicates. Burrows, the antagonist, is a notorious and ruthless leader of a dangerous criminal organization. The movie is set in a bustling metropolis, riddled with crime and corruption. Step 2: Establish the inciting incident. The plot would begin with Cheng's undercover life being exposed by Burrows, causing a tragic loss for our protagonist. Cheng's partner, an experienced officer with a family, is killed by Burrows' men in cold blood as retribution for Cheng's attempts to infiltrate and dismantle their criminal operations. Step 3: Raise the stakes. In the midst of his pursuit of justice, Cheng also discovers that Burrows has close ties with certain corrupt politicians and high-ranking police officers in the city. The web of deceit and corruption runs deep, but Cheng is determined to avenge his partner's death, bring down Burrows, and expose the corruption within law enforcement. Step 4: Develop subplots and supporting characters. As Cheng delves deeper into the criminal underworld, he forms an alliance with a tech-savvy informant named Lena, who shares his passion for justice and has personal connections to Burrows' victims. Together, they unravel a larger conspiracy and avenge the lives lost to Burrows' reign of terror. Step 5: Create a turning point. Cheng and Lena make significant progress in their mission, but just as they plan to confront Burrows and his allies, Lena is kidnapped by Burrows' gang. Cheng is now faced with the task of rescuing Lena while simultaneously executing his plan to bring down Burrows and expose the corrupt officials. Step 6: Establish the climax. In an intense hostage situation, Cheng infiltrates Burrows' criminal stronghold, where Lena is being held captive. The climax unfolds as Cheng stealthily takes down Burrows' henchmen. The final confrontation between Cheng and Burrows ensues, leading to an action-packed shootout. Step 7: The resolution. Cheng, driven by rage and determination for justice, shoots Burrows repeatedly with his handgun. Burrows falls to his death, symbolizing the end of his destructive reign over the city. Cheng rescues Lena and, together, they expose the corrupt officials tied to Burrows' organization. Ultimately, they succeed in restoring balance and honor to the city. In conclusion, Cheng shooting Burrows repeatedly serves as the climactic resolution of the movie plot, signifying the end of a brutal criminal era, the avenging of Cheng's partner, and a step towards justice in a city plagued by corruption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and some other English speaking countries. It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century. In some rural parts of Australia, a shire is a local government area; however, in Australia it is not synonymous with a \\"county\\", which is a lands administrative division. The word derives from the Old English \\"scir\\", itself a derivative of the Proto-Germanic \\"skizo\\" (cf. Old High German \\"scira\\"), meaning care or official charge. In the UK, \\"shire\\" is the original term for what is usually known now as a \\"county\\"; the word \\"county\\" having been introduced at the Norman Conquest of England. The two are nearly synonymous. Although in modern British usage counties are referred to as \\"shires\\" mainly in poetic contexts, terms such as Shire Hall remain common. Shire also remains a common part of many county names. In regions with so-called rhotic pronunciation such as Scotland, the word \\"shire\\" is pronounced or . In non-rhotic areas the final R is silent unless the next word begins in a vowel. When \\"shire\\" is a suffix as part of a placename in England, the vowel is unstressed and thus usually shortened and/or monophthongised: pronunciations include , or sometimes , with the pronunciation of the final R again depending on rhoticity. In many words, the vowel is normally reduced all the way to a single schwa, as in for instance \\"Leicestershire\\" or \\"Berkshire\\" .

As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued. Question: \\"Why did General Musharraf promise Karl Inderfurth and Michael Sheehan that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden?\\" Answer: \\"He promised he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Answer: \\"No, the answer is not correct.\\" A more accurate and detailed answer: General Musharraf promised to meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden because he was enticed by the possibility of a presidential visit from the United States in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. President Clinton's visit would be a sign of legitimacy for Musharraf's government, which he greatly desired. However, the paragraph also suggests that despite Musharraf's promise, the U.S. officials left the meeting doubting Pakistan's willingness to take action on the issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Yes, you can put hydrogen peroxide in your ears as a means of softening and removing earwax, but it must be done correctly and safely. Here is the step-by-step process: 1. First, make sure the hydrogen peroxide you are using is a 3% solution, which is safe for use in the ears. Higher concentrations are too strong and can cause irritation. 2. Before beginning, lie down on your side or tilt your head so the ear you're treating is facing up. 3. Using a clean dropper, place 5 to 10 drops of hydrogen peroxide into the ear. 4. Stay in the same position for 5 to 10 minutes. You might hear a bubbling sound - this is normal, it's the hydrogen peroxide breaking up the earwax. 5. After the time is up, sit up and use a clean cotton ball or tissue to catch any of the remaining liquid as it comes out of the ear. 6. You can now rinse out your ear with warm (not hot) water. This can be done in the shower, or by using a bulb syringe filled with warm water. 7. Finally, dry the outer ear with a towel or hand-held hair dryer. Remember to not use this method if you have any ear conditions, such as an ear infection or a perforated (burst) eardrum. Always consult your health care provider before trying new health remedies.

Edita Tracey, 35, suffered a foot-long rupture in the main blood vessel taking blood from her heart to the rest of her body. Miraculously, she is now back at home with her daughter and is expected to make a full recovery. Edita Tracey, 35, nearly died when her aorta ruptured when she was 36 weeks pregnant. Mrs Tracey, from Philadelphia, was 36 weeks pregnant and in the hairdressers when she started suffering pain back pain, Fox 29 reports. She says the pain was not severe – it was more of a pressing pain. She phoned her husband, Ken, who was on a business trip but said he would fly home immediately. But when the pain spread to her chest, she called an ambulance. She told Fox 29: ‘The last thing I remember is emergency people coming, and that's it. I don't remember anything else.’ Mrs Tracey was rushed to hospital where tests revealed her aorta - the largest blood vessel in the human body - had ruptured and she did not have long to live. Medics immediately sent Mrs Tracey’s scans to a cardiologist and organised for her to be airlifted to another hospital. Mrs Tracey had nine hours of emergency surgery during which baby Arabella was delivered and her aorta was repaired. She and Arabella are pictured with her husband, Ken. Amazingly, baby Arabella did not suffer any ill effects as a result of her traumatic birth. When she arrived she was rushed into emergency surgery and within 30 seconds of her being put to sleep, her baby had been delivered. Miraculously, Arabella was born completely healthy and weighing 6lbs 12oz. Mrs Tracey was extremely lucky to survive the rupture in her aorta as it is the largest blood vessel in the body. Image shows an aorta. However, her mother remained in surgery for nearly nine hours as surgeons fought to repair the foot-long tear in her aorta. Dr Omar Lattouf, the cardiologist, said it was the most complicated case he had ever encountered in his 30 years of operating. He had to drain all of the blood that was gathering around her heart, before putting her on a heart and lung bypass machine. The surgical team then had to reduce her body temperature to prevent brain damage while they repaired her aorta. While Mrs Tracey was still in surgery, her husband arrived at the hospital and was able to hold Arabella for the first time. He told Fox 29: ‘You think about the baby, this should be a joyous occasion. And now your mind goes right back, it goes right back to if she's going to make it. The whole night was up and down.’ It was not until the next day that Mrs Tracey woke up. She was in intensive care but was able to be brought her newborn baby. She is now recovering at home and says she is incredibly grateful to the surgeons who saved her life. She is expected to make a full recovery but doctors are still trying to establish why her aorta ruptured. They believe she may have developed pre-eclampsia as a result of the pregnancy and that this could have caused her blood pressure to increase, putting pressure on her aorta.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977.

Article: If you walk around any large city, you'll find a coffee shop on every corner. Many shops offer comfortable sofas, large screen televisions and sometimes even live music. More and more teenagers are hanging out there. My pre-teen has already done so after school once a month, but she always orders fruit juice. I think she would drink coffee sooner or later, so I started doing some research online. I found that coffee in moderation could be safe, but one thing that was constant online was the chance of becoming addicted to coffee. Coffee is one step up from soda but still not as dangerous as energy drinks or alcohol. Still, any addiction is hard to break, so I needed to come up with a plan that would protect my child. Coffee shops offer a safe place for teenagers to hang out. As like anything else you let your children do, you need to set limits. Drinking coffee while socializing once or twice a week won't cause a severe caffeine addiction. However, you should avoid allowing a cup of coffee every morning and ensure they get adequate sleep each night, which will make them less likely to feel the need to drink coffee. As parents, we have responsibility to set a good example. If you're addicted to caffeine, it's time to start monitoring your intake. If you drink much water and keep healthier drink options in your fridge and at your dinner table, your teenager will follow you. I drink much water and so do both my children. _ As a mother, I'm ready to allow my child to try coffee and we'll talk about it and discuss the pros and cons of consuming this. I feel open communication is vital in helping them make good decisions. Although the decision to drink coffee doesn't pose the same dangers as underage drinking, it still deserves a thoughtful conversation.

Information: - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - John Michael \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor.

The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The Company's army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years' War, and the two continued to co-operate in arenas outside India: the eviction of the French from Egypt (1799), the capture of Java from the Netherlands (1811), the acquisition of Penang Island (1786), Singapore (1819) and Malacca (1824), and the defeat of Burma (1826).From its base in India, the Company had also been engaged in an increasingly profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests of opium led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.During the late 18th and early 19th centuries the British Crown began to assume an increasingly large role in the affairs of the Company. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired. The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline. The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides. The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India.

A 911 call from the residents of 5315 Peach Ave. came about 5 p.m., according to Hillsborough County Fire Rescue. The floor of the duplex buckled and the walls cracked, according to agency spokesman Ronnie Rivera, but a visible sinkhole did not open. Fire Rescue probed the ground around the home and found soft soil, Rivera said, before recommending the families stay elsewhere Tuesday night. The American Red Cross was called to assist the families, and a soil sampling crew will come today to test the ground under the home. Tuesday's incident came less than a month after a sinkhole opened under 240 Faithway Drive, about 3 miles away, killing Jeffrey Bush, 37, and forcing the evacuation of two adjacent homes. Bush's home was demolished and the other homes are still vacant, according to Hillsborough County spokesman Willie Puz. Saturday, two homes on Lake Shore Ranch Drive, about 2 miles away from Bush's home, were temporarily evacuated because a sinkhole opened in the yard between them. The families returned that night, Puz said.

Physical commodities are bought and sold in bulk for immediate delivery in specialized markets around the world. These markets are known as the \\"spot\\" or \\"cash\\" market. The majority of participants in the spot market are producers, and users of the commodity, able to finance and store large amounts of a commodity such as a refinery buying crude oil or a flour miller buying wheat and corn. As a consequence, individual investors rarely purchase any physical commodity except precious metals like gold, silver, platinum. or palladium. An individual taking delivery of a physical commodity must be prepared to: Pay a premium over the spot price, whether purchasing coins or bullion. Premiums can range up to 25% of the spot prices. Pay cash for the total purchase price. If an investor wishes to leverage his purchase, he must find and negotiate with a private lender who is willing to accept the metal as collateral. Pay extra charges for storage and insurance to protect against theft. Assume the risks of illiquidity. Finding a buyer for a large amount of gold, for example, might be difficult and expensive You can buy physical commodities by visiting specific websites or exchanges where they are sold. They are not available through standard brokerages. Finding reputable markets to buy in can be difficult, however. Look for well-known authorities to point you towards safe places to trade physical commodities. For example, the World Gold Council maintains a list of reputable sites selling gold coins and bullion. Physical commodities need to be stored in secure locations until sale. You can also buy insurance to protect you from a total loss if the commodities are stolen.

Step 1: Isolate the variable 'u' on one side of the equation. To do that, we first need to eliminate -5*u from the right side of the equation and combine it with the term on the left side that also has the variable 'u' which is -10*u. -10*u + 10 = -5*u Add 5*u to both sides of the equation to eliminate -5*u from the right side. -10*u + 5*u + 10 = -5*u + 5*u Combine the terms that have the variable 'u' on the left side: -5*u + 10 = 0 Step 2: Isolate 'u' Now we need to isolate the variable 'u' by eliminating the constant term (number without a variable) which is +10 in this case. To eliminate it, subtract 10 from both sides of the equation. -5*u + 10 - 10 = 0 - 10 -5*u = -10 Step 3: Solve for 'u' Now we have -5*u = -10. We need to get the value of 'u' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'u' which is -5 in this equation. -5*u / -5 = -10 / -5 Now divide the terms: u = 2 The solution for the equation -10*u + 10 = -5*u is u = 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

All I can say about the Necromaniac/Schizophreniac 2 series is... if you are even remotely \\"PC\\" or don't have a seriously messed up sense of humor, then you probably wont get it. As sick and disgusting as this movie is, it really is a comedy and not a \\"horror\\" movie at all. If you can appreciate somebody who pushes the bounds of good taste and political correctness to the most extreme limits imaginable, to the point where is becomes so out of hand that it's comical, then you must see this to believe it. This movie is so out of control that a major film studio couldn't touch this with a 10 foot pole (with a condom on the end). In my opinion though, the best, most extreme pieces of art come from way underground. If you don't stick to the same old formula that people are used to seeing, then they reject it. I have seen stacks of terrible, boring, z-grade, Indy movies that were just a waste of a perfectly good VHS tape or DVD-R. I have also seen stacks of stink bombs coming from the big named studios that were a complete waste of millions of dollars. When a NO BUDGET film like these two from Ron Atkins/John Giancaspro come out and blow all of the other \\"shock\\" films completely out of the water, you really have to take a second look at the whole Indy movie scene. After seeing this, you can really see how much freedom an Indy film maker can have when they work on their own. The funny thing is, even the other people who saw this movie and \\"hated it\\" admit to the fact that they laughed all the way through it. I don't think that is is possible for anybody to get bored watching either of these two. So if don't take everything that you seen in the mainstream media too seriously, and are able to laugh at a misanthropic, puppet wielding psychopath who has finally snapped, YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.

Answer the following question: Ash was a fire fighter and recently saved a group of children from a terrible fire at the cinema. This made Ash every man's hero and rightly so. Given the context: How would Ash feel afterwards? Possible answers: ashamed, disappointed, proud Answer:","completion":"Ash would most likely feel proud after saving the group of children from the terrible fire at the cinema. As a firefighter, Ash's primary responsibility is to protect and save lives in emergency situations. Successfully rescuing the children from the fire would demonstrate that they were able to fulfill that responsibility, despite the challenging and dangerous circumstances. As a result, Ash would feel a sense of accomplishment and pride in their work. In addition to that, Ash's heroic actions have earned them the admiration and gratitude of the community. This acknowledgment would further enhance Ash's sense of pride. People often look up to firefighters as helpers in times of crisis, and the recognition of their heroic actions, coupled with the knowledge that they were able to save the lives of several children, creates a strong and rewarding emotional experience for Ash. Furthermore, in high-risk and high-stress situations like fighting a fire, it is not uncommon for people to feel a mix of emotions. Ash might also feel relieved that they were able to save the children without any significant injuries or fatalities. They may also feel emotionally drained or exhausted after the intense event, but ultimately, the overall feeling would be pride due to their ability to save lives and positively impact the community. It is unlikely that Ash would feel ashamed or disappointed, given the context of their actions. Saving the lives of several children from a dangerous situation, and being hailed as a hero, would not result in feelings of shame or disappointment. Instead, these emotions would stem from failures or perceived inadequacies, which is not the case in this scenario. In conclusion, the most probable emotion Ash would experience after rescuing the group of children from the cinema fire would be pride. This feeling would arise from their success in their duty as a firefighter, the appreciation they receive from the community, and the knowledge that they were able to save lives during a perilous event. While other emotions, such as relief or exhaustion, might also come into play, feelings of shame or disappointment would not align with the positive outcome and overwhelming gratitude that Ash encounters after their heroic actions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The use of \\"but uh\\" indicates the possibility that the speaker's emotions or thoughts about the situation have changed since those initial experiences.

The premise suggests that there was fear in the beginning, but there might have been a change in the speaker's feelings or thoughts about the situation later on. B. The hypothesis claims that there was a strong negative emotion (hate) regarding the activity in the beginning. With this analysis, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis because the premise only talks about the experience being scary at first, while the hypothesis claims the speaker hated it the first few times. Although both statements mention negative emotions during the initial experiences, fear and hate are not the same emotion.

His breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which was a box-office hit and resulted in a sequel. In 1984, he appeared in James Cameron's science-fiction thriller film The Terminator, which was a massive critical and box-office success. Schwarzenegger subsequently reprised the Terminator character in the franchise's later installments in 1991, 2003, and 2015.

It seems too that billionaires really like houses in Hawaii. As is the case with the richest women in America the richest people in America donate a lot of money to causes they care about. Some of the men on this list have donated hundreds of millions into research designed to improve human lifespan and eradicate dangerous diseases such as Alzheimerâs disease and cancer.

LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner will have no phones, computer or access to the outside world – except via one video that connects to the museum. During this time the artists will only be able to speak to visitors of the exhibition. They hope the performance acts as an antidote to being “constantly connected” and functions as a reaction to the global “digital revolution and its impact on our culture, economy, human identity, and behaviour”. Or, put simply, the fact that we are literally never alone, not communicating with anyone, or without our phones. The performance, which is likely to be rather testing in terms of the artists’ willpower and ability to be completely alone, combines participatory performance, installation and livestream. It shares similar themes with HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US, #TOUCHMYSOUL, #ALLMYMOVIES, #TAKEMEANYWHERE, and #INTRODUCTIONS, all of which saw the artists comment on unity, technology, celebrity, and division. Their works are studies of human interaction and their key tools are social media and the internet, which they see as positive forces. The trio’s practice revolves around empathy, emotion and a reaction to the cynical irony and hollowness of postmodernism in the face of today’s dire global crises. ||||| #ALONETOGETHER weaves a virtual link between Kiasma’s visitors and the artists. From 12 April 2017, LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner will spend a month in three remote cabins somewhere in Lapland, entirely cut off from other people. A video link to a small cabin installed in the gallery is their only point of contact with the outside world. Inside the Kiasma cabin, the public can speak directly with the artists, who can communicate with visitors—but not with each other—by text. A live video from the gallery appears above, displaying the real-time text communications from the artists as a continuous stream. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In April 2017, actor Shia LaBeouf and his art collective, Nastja Ronkko and Luke Turner, embarked on a project called #ALONETOGETHER. The performance involved the three artists spending a month isolated in separate cabins in Finland's remote Lapland region. Their only communication with the outside world was through text messages to visitors of the Kiasama museum in Helsinki. The project aimed to explore the impact of constant connectivity on culture, economy, human identity, and behavior. It also served as a reaction to the digital revolution and the idea that people are never truly disconnected from others. During the project, LaBeouf, Ronkko, and Turner had no access to phones, computers, or the outside world except via a video link that connected to the museum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which person learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean? Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be deduced that Barry learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. This conclusion can be reached by analyzing the specializations of both geologists and relating them to the concepts discussed in the paragraph. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor, both of which are directly related to the processes occurring in the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The paragraph explains how the Pacific Ocean's plates are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries, resulting in the volcanic activity associated with the Ring of Fire. Additionally, the Pacific Ocean is home to the East Pacific Rise, one of the world's most active spreading centers. Both subduction zones and the formation of new oceanic crust are essential aspects of the geological processes shaping the Ring of Fire. On the other hand, Will is specialized in montology, which is not explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. Montology concerns the study of mountains and their formation processes. While the volcanic activity in the Ring of Fire does lead to the formation of some volcanic mountains, the paragraph predominantly focuses on the subduction and spreading processes occurring in the Pacific Ocean. As such, it can be inferred that the information provided in the paragraph is more relevant to Barry's specialization than to Will's. Therefore, based on the specializations of the two geologists and the content of the paragraph, it can be concluded that Barry learned more about the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Above all, your car should be light. The smaller the mass of your car, the better — every gram or milligram you can shave off of your car's frame is a little further your mousetrap will be able to push your car. Try not to have any extra frame material beyond what's necessary to keep your mousetrap and wheel axles in place. If you see wasted space on your frame, try removing it, or, if this is impossible, make holes in it with a drill to bring its weight down. You'll also want to use the lightest material possible for your frame. Here are just a few suitable ones: Balsa wood Hard plastic sheets Thin, light metal sheets (aluminum/tin roofing material, etc.) Building toys (K'NEX, Legos, etc.) Ideally, you want your car to be shaped aerodynamically — that is so that it presents the smallest possible surface area in the direction it will travel. Like an arrow, a longboat, an airplane, or a spear, a vehicle that's designed with maximum efficiency in mind will almost always have a long, skinny shape to minimize drag from air resistance. For the purposes of your mousetrap car, this will mean making your frame both narrow (though it will be difficult to get your frame any narrower than the mousetrap itself) and vertically skinny. Remember, to minimize drag, you're trying to give your car the narrowest, smallest profile possible. Try getting down on the ground and looking at your car from the front to spot pieces of the frame that make your car's profile unnecessarily large. Wherever you can, try to use glue in your car's design, rather than nails, pins, or other heavier solutions. For instance, you should only need to use just a few small spots of glue to fix your mousetrap to the frame. Generally, the glue will hold just as well as nails, which can add unnecessary weight. Use super glue not school glue it won't hold as good. Another advantage of glue is that it shouldn't usually affect your car's air resistance. On the other hand, if either end of a nail sticks out of your frame, it can have a minor effect. The only limiting factor when it comes to how light and skinny you can make your mousetrap car's frame is its fragility — if it's too light, it may become so fragile that the action of springing the mousetrap breaks the car apart. The delicate balance between achieving the maximum distance and making your car unstable can be quite tricky to get right, but don't be afraid to experiment. The mousetrap itself is unlikely to ever break, so as long as you have extra frame material, you'll have the freedom to make mistakes. If you're using an extra-fragile material like balsa wood and you're having a hard time getting your frame to hold together, consider adding a small strip of a sturdier material like metal or plastic on the underside of the frame. Doing this increases the structural strength of the car while minimizing the change to its air resistance and weight. Summary:","completion":"To make a good mousetrap car, it should be very light and have a slim shape. Use a light material like balsa wood, hard plastic, or even toys like Legos for the frame. Make sure your car has a narrow and skinny shape so it moves smoothly through the air. Use glue instead of nails to make your car lighter and avoid extra weight. Be careful not to make the car too fragile, because it could break when the mousetrap is used. Instead, you can add a strip of strong material to make the car stronger without making it heavy. Don't be afraid to try different things to make your mousetrap car work the best!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Timeline: The San Bernardino shooting and aftermath, step by step Fathers, mothers, a free spirit: Who the San Bernardino victims were ||||| President Obama's full remarks on terrorism from the White House on Sunday. Obama misspoke about San Bernardino suspect's visa The president incorrectly suggested she had entered the country without a visa. In announcing one of the new steps his administration is taking to secure the U.S. from terrorists, President Barack Obama's carefully scripted Sunday night address to the nation included at least one mistake. Obama said he'd requested a review of the \\"visa waiver program\\" under which one of the suspected San Bernardino attackers arrived in the United States. But that alleged assailant, Tashfeen Malik, came under a fiancé visa; she didn't arrive under the program that waives a visa requirement. Story Continued Below “I’ve ordered the departments of State and Homeland Security to review the visa waiver program under which the female terrorist in San Bernardino originally came to this country,” Obama said in the prime-time address. White House officials confirmed after the speech that the president was supposed to say \\"visa program,\\" but apparently the word \\"waiver\\" also slipped through. The official transcript includes a correction. The Obama administration already has been reviewing and tightening the visa waiver program, which allows visa-free travel to the United States from people in nearly 40 countries, many of them in Europe. Malik was from Pakistan and had also spent many years in Saudi Arabia. Neither of those countries falls under the U.S. visa waiver program. She used her Pakistani passport to come to the U.S. to live with her U.S. citizen husband and fellow suspected attacker, Syed Rizwan Farook. Obama's announcement that the \\"K-1\\" fiancé visa program will also now face review could spur calls in Congress for an even broader look at the country's visa policies. It was not immediately clear if the review he's calling for will also cover the so-called marriage visas, which are separate from fiancé visas. The fiancé visa allows the recipient to travel to the U.S. to marry his or her intended spouse within 90 days of arrival. After that, the visa recipient can apply to adjust his or her status to become a U.S. permanent resident. Getting admitted under a fiancé or marriage visa is not simple. A couple often has to prove through significant documentation and multiple interviews that they are truly in a relationship, and the process can take many months. However, it's easier to get to the United States through the fiancé or marriage visa programs than it is to arrive through the U.S. refugee resettlement program, which has come under scrutiny in Congress since the November attacks in Paris.

They massacre the ranch hands and kidnap Little Jake, the grandson, leaving a ransom note and heading back for Mexico, where they have been hiding out. Martha, the head of the family, is offered the help of both the army and the Texas Rangers in hunting the gang. She replies that this will be \\"a harsh and unpleasant kind of business and will require an extremely harsh and unpleasant kind of person to see it through.\\" In consequence, she sends for her estranged husband, the aging Jacob \\"Big Jake\\" McCandles, a near-legendary gunfighter who wanders the west with his Rough Collie, simply named Dog. When Jake arrives by train, he and Martha discuss a plan to take the ransom to the kidnappers, a million dollars in a big red strongbox, although Jake warns that, \\"Pay or not, we run the risk of never seeing the boy again\\". Then his son Michael rides up on a motorcycle, bringing word that he has seen the kidnappers in the Chilicothe Canyon. The Texas Ranger captain is present and offers the services of his men, equipped with three REO touring cars. They, however, are ambushed and their cars put out of action. Jake, preferring the old ways, has followed on horseback, accompanied by an old Apache associate, Sam Sharpnose. He is now joined by his sons, Michael and James, with whom his relations are tense because of his desertion of the family ten years before. That night, Fain rides into their camp to make arrangements for the handover, telling Jake that they will âsend the boy's body back in a basket\\" if anything should go wrong. Both men deny any personal stake in the business, each claiming to be \\"just a messenger boy\\". The family party crosses into Mexico the next day and checks into a hotel.

Sentence: The Indian pariah dog is a specially bred dog","completion":"After carefully examining the text, the sentence \\"The Indian pariah dog is a specially bred dog\\" is false. The text states that the Indian pariah dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\") is the aboriginal landrace, or naturally selected dog, of the Indian sub-continent. This means that the Indian pariah dog has evolved and been selected by nature in its native environment, rather than specifically bred or developed by humans for particular traits or purposes. The Indian pariah dog is thought to be one of the oldest dog breeds in the world. It is proposed by one author to be the progenitor of the Australian dingo, which suggests that this breed has been around for quite some time, having a significant influence on the development of other dog breeds. Such ancient dogs evolved to survive in their environment without human intervention, leading to their classification as landrace dogs. Furthermore, the text mentions that the exact place of origin of the Indian pariah dog has not been determined. This lack of specific information about its origin further emphasizes the natural, rather than purposely bred, development of this breed. In conclusion, the Indian pariah dog is not a specially bred dog but is rather an aboriginal landrace, a naturally selected dog of the Indian sub-continent.

Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program.

The President is the highest popularly elected official in Iran, although the President answers to the Supreme Leader of Iran, who functions as the country's head of state. Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates and procedures for election, as well as the President's powers and responsibilities as \\"functions of the executive\\". These include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs; and appointing ministers subject to the approval of Parliament. However, in reality the president mainly gets the blame for failures than actually making the decisions. The current long-time Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has been ruling for nearly three decades, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on economy, environment, foreign policy, national planning such as population growth, and everything else in Iran. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and has fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments. - Rafsanjan (also Romanized as Rafsanjn and Rafsinjn; also known as Bahrmbd) is a city in and the capital of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God. - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - Tehran ( \\"Tehrn\\") is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province.

Ali Khamenei succeeded Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian Revolution, after Khomeini's death, being elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989, at age 49. Current Iranian president Hassan Rouhani arranged for Khamenei to get his first major post in the provisional revolutionary government as deputy defense minister. Khamenei also served as the President of Iran from 1981 to 1989. In 2012, 2013, and 2014 \\"Forbes\\" selected him 21st, 23rd, and 19th, respectively, in the list of \\"The World's Most Powerful People\\". - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe.

It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran was adopted by referendum on 2 and 3 December 1979, and went into force replacing the Constitution of 1905. It was amended on 28 July 1989. The constitution has been called a \\"hybrid\\" of \\"theocratic and democratic elements\\". While articles One and Two vest sovereignty in God, article six \\"mandates popular elections for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.\\" However all democratic procedures and rights are subordinate to the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, whose powers are spelled out in Chapter Eight (Articles 107-112). - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman. - An Islamic republic is the name given to several states in countries ruled by Islamic laws, including the Islamic Republics of Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and Mauritania. Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958. Iran adopted it after the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty. Afghanistan adopted it in 1992 (in 19962001 the Taliban was ruling as an Islamic emirate (monarchy)) upon Jamiat-e Islami seizing capital Kabul from the Communists. Despite the similar name the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws. - Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (or Hashemi Bahramani; 25 August 1934 8 January 2017) was an influential Iranian politician, writer and one of the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic who was the fourth President of Iran from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the Assembly of Experts from 2007 until 2011 when he decided not to nominate himself for the post. He was also the chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council. - The Assembly of Experts (also Assembly of Experts of the Leadership) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also translated as Council of Experts, is a deliberative body of Iran consisting of eighty eight (88) Mujtahids (Islamic theologians) that is charged with electing and removing the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervising his activities. Members of the assembly are elected from lists of candidates by direct public vote for eight-year terms. The number of members has ranged from 82 elected in 1982 to 88 elected in 2016. Current laws require the assembly to meet for at least two days every six months. The current chairman of the Fifth Assembly is Ahmad Jannati. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), must be approved by the Guardian Council, while half of its members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Accordingly, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Ahmad Azari Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts. - The Expediency Discernment Council of the System (\\"Majma' Tašxis Malahat Nezâm\\") is an administrative assembly appointed by the Supreme Leader and was created upon the revision to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 6 February 1988. It was originally set up to resolve differences or conflicts between the Majlis and the Guardian Council, but \\"its true power lies more in its advisory role to the Supreme Leader.\\" According to Hooman Majd, the Leader \\"delegated some of his own authority to the council granting it supervisory powers over all branches of the government\\" following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west.

Historic: President Barack Obama will make a groundbreaking visit to Burma later this month, it has emerged. He is pictured celebrating following his re-election on Tuesday. President Barack Obama will make history by becoming the first U.S. President to visit Burma, it has emerged. The visit - which would be one of the first foreign trips following Obama's re-election on Tuesday - will take place on November 18/19, according to an official within the Burmese government. It will be part of Obama's efforts to encourage democracy in the Southeast Asian nation. The official, who did not want to be. named, said Obama would meet with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi as. well as government officials including reformist President Thein Sein. U.S. officials have not yet announced any plans for a visit, which would come less than two weeks after Obama's election to a second term. The Burmese official, speaking from the. capital, Naypyitaw, said today that security for the visit had been. prepared, but that the schedule was not final. Obama's administration has sought to encourage the recent democratic progress under Thein Sein by easing sanctions applied against Burma's previous military regime. Officials in nearby Thailand and Cambodia have already informally announced plans for visits by Obama that same week. Cambodia is hosting a summit meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and Thailand is a longtime close U.S. ally. The visit to Burma would be the culmination of a dramatic turnaround in relations with Washington as the country has shifted from five decades of ruinous military rule and shaken off the pariah status it had earned through its bloody suppression of democracy. Obama's ending of the long-standing U.S. isolation of Burma's generals has played a part in coaxing them into political reforms that have unfolded with surprising speed in the past year. The U.S. has appointed a full. ambassador and suspended sanctions to reward Burma for political. prisoner releases and the election of Nobel laureate Suu Kyi to. parliament. Groundbreaking: An official within the Burmese government said Obama would meet with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, right, as well as reformist President Thein Sein, left. From Burma's point of view, the lifting of sanctions is essential for. boosting a lagging economy that was hurt not only by sanctions that. curbed exports and foreign investment, but also by what had been a. protectionist, centralised approach. Thein Sein's government has initiated major economic reforms in addition to political ones. A procession of senior diplomats and world leaders have traveled to Burma, stopping both in the remote, opulent capital city, which was built by the former ruling junta, and at Suu Kyi's dilapidated lakeside villa in the main city of Yangon, where she spent 15 years under house arrest. New Zealand announced today that Prime Minister John Key would visit Burma after attending the regional meetings in Cambodia. Significant: The most senior U.S. official to visit Burma was Hillary Clinton, who last December became the first U.S. secretary of state to travel to the country in 56 years. The most senior U.S. official to visit was Hillary Rodham Clinton, who last December became the first U.S. secretary of state to travel to the country in 56 years. The Obama administration regards the political changes in Burma as a marquee achievement in its foreign policy, and one that could dilute the influence of China in a country that has a strategic location between South and Southeast Asia, regions of growing economic importance. But exiled Burmese activists and human rights groups are likely to criticise an Obama visit as premature, rewarding Thein Sein before his political and economic reforms have truly taken root.

Their music is known for its brand of \\"minimalistic psychedelia\\". Spacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade. However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. Context: In November 1985, Spacemen 3 played a gig at a leisure centre in Coventry to an audience of fewer than ten people. Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined that they ought to record a new demo tape. By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones. \\"The band's sound had crystallised into the intense, hypnotic, overloaded psychedelia which characterised their early [record] output, and which would serve as a template for their live act throughout their existence\\" (Ian Edmond, Record Collector). At Pierce's instigation, Pete Bain rejoined the band on bass in order to fill out their sound. Despite being a 4-piece again, they would retain the name 'Spacemen 3'. Kember and Pierce opted to upgrade their guitar equipment ahead of recording the new demos. Kember purchased a Burns Jazz electric guitar and 1960s Vox Conqueror amplifier; whilst Pierce bought a Fender Telecaster and a 1970s HH amplifier. Both of their new amplifiers included distortion/fuzz and tremolo; these two effects were key components of Spacemen 3's signature sound. In January 1986, Spacemen 3 attended the home studio of Carlo Marocco at Piddington, outside Northampton, to record their new demo tape. They spent three-and-a-half days at the 16-track studio. Recording live as a group, with minimal overdubs, they managed to get demos for approximately seven songs. Kember and Pierce handled the production. These \\"fine set of performances\\" (Ned Raggett, AllMusic) would later be unofficially released as the vinyl album Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To on the Father Yod label in 1990 (albeit described incorrectly as \\"rehearsals in Rugby\\"). Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a record deal shortly after producing their new demos. Pat Fish had given a copy of the demo tape to Dave Barker, the owner of the independent record label Glass Records, to whom Fish's band The Jazz Butcher were signed. Spacemen 3 signed a three-year, two-album recording contract with Glass Records in early 1986. Question: What did the band do after the demo was released? Answer:","completion":"After the release of their demo, which was later unofficially released as the vinyl album Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To in 1990, Spacemen 3 managed to secure a record deal, thanks to the help of Pat Fish. He had shared a copy of the demo tape with Dave Barker, owner of the independent label Glass Records. Impressed by their sound, Barker offered Spacemen 3 a three-year, two-album recording contract, which the band signed in early 1986. With this newfound support, Spacemen 3 began working on their debut album, \\"Sound of Confusion,\\" which was released in 1986. The album showcased their hypnotic, minimalistic psychedelia, heavily influenced by the garage and psychedelia bands of the 1960s. Though it wasn't a massive commercial success, the album brought Spacemen 3 to the attention of music enthusiasts and garnered them a cult following. The band then moved on to create their critically acclaimed second album, \\"The Perfect Prescription,\\" in 1987. This album further developed their signature sound and featured a mix of experimental tracks, offering a more introspective and spiritual direction compared to their previous work. The album stood as evidence of Spacemen 3's maturation and growth as musicians and propelled them into greater recognition among alternative music fans. Throughout the remainder of the 1980s, Spacemen 3 continued to perform live, develop their sound, and release new material. In 1989, they released their third studio album, \\"Playing With Fire.\\" As the band's popularity grew, so too did the internal tensions between Kember and Pierce. These struggles eventually culminated in the band's breakup in 1990. Despite the acrimonious split, Spacemen 3 released one final studio album post-breakup, titled \\"Recurring,\\" in 1991. The album featured songs written and recorded separately by Kember and Pierce, reflecting their increasingly divergent creative visions. Following their disbandment, both Kember and Pierce would go on to form new projects, with Kember founding Sonic Boom and later Spectrum, and Pierce forming Spiritualized, both of which saw considerable success throughout the 1990s and beyond. In summary, after the release of their demo, Spacemen 3 secured a record deal and went on to release a series of albums that cemented their place in alternative rock history. Their unique sound and uncompromising approach to music contributed to their enduring influence, leaving a lasting legacy in the genre."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The first way is to get _ on the specific things you want. There is a limitation to this type of approach (,) though. If you find the lowest price on the best hotel in Honolulu at the height of the season, you will save money, but still have a very expensive vacation. Trying to get exactly what you want will generally be an expensive proposition, in travel and in life. The other approach is to be a true opportunist. This will be difficult for some of you, and entirely unacceptable to others. Nonetheless ,the travelers who get to travel the most, go to the widest variety of places, learn the most and do the most, are the opportunists. This will be true until you are so wealthy that you have no monetary (;)limits. The first time I went to Ecuador, I went there because it was cheap. If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost 1045, which included airfare and even the 130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only 256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and could only take carry-on luggage. Never did I feel deprived, or bored. I had a great time, eating wherever it was cheap and clean, doing all sorts of inexpensive, but interesting things, and traveling across the country to climb Chimborazo. I also met and fell in love with my wife Ana. Being an opportunist means you'll have just as much variety, and probably almost everything you want--eventually. You just have to stop trying to get exactly what you want exactly when you want it.

Hypothesis: Morten Johannes Lauridsen loves teaching students music.","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph, it is not possible to conclusively determine whether the hypothesis that \\"Morten Johannes Lauridsen loves teaching students music\\" is true. While the information states that Morten Johannes Lauridsen has been a professor of composition at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music for more than 40 years, the emotional state of 'loving' to teach cannot be objectively derived from this statement. The extended duration of his teaching career might suggest a passion for teaching, but there is no explicit statement made regarding how he feels about this aspect of his professional life. The given paragraph also validates other facets about Lauridsen's career, such as his remarkable role as composer-in-residence of the Los Angeles Master Chorale from 1994 till 2001, his achievement of receiving the National Medal of Arts in 2007, and his status as an American composer. Unfortunately, none of these data points inherently address his emotional ties to teaching. However, it's worth noting that emotions and preferences are often subjective, intricate, and personal aspects of an individual's life. Therefore, accurately evaluating or confirming such a hypothesis would need direct, explicit evidence - for instance, statements by Morten Johannes Lauridsen himself that he enjoys or loves teaching music to students. Furthermore, interviews with students or colleagues that highlight his passion for teaching could also provide supporting evidence. In conclusion, while speculatively Lauridsen's long career in teaching might suggest a fondness for this profession, the provided paragraph does not furnish enough evidence to unequivocally declare the hypothesis true. More direct information about Lauridsen's feelings or thoughts towards teaching would be required to confirm the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of the product review appears to be neutral verging on negative. The reviewer has not had the chance to experience the product themselves, as it has not been released yet. They express frustration at the premature judgments and ratings that have been placed on the product, suggesting the pejorative tone. However, they apply balance due to the absence of personal interaction with the product, which brings the overall sentiment more towards neutrality rather than outright negativity. The negative tone is derived from their critique of people's premature judgements rather than the product itself. Their intention seems not to malign the product, but to correct hasty and possibly unwarranted reactions. However, frustration with this situation could potentially convey a negative tone to another product - in this case, the review system or people's usage of it. The neutral tone comes from the fact that they haven't expressed either satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the product. They haven’t rated the product poorly or positively, nor provided specific criticisms or praise for its features, quality, usability, or value. They express only a desire to neutralize the initial product rating which was made prior to the product being released.

We have this equation: 0 = 12*r - 10 - 26. First, we need to combine the numbers that don't have the letter \\"r\\" with them, which are -10 and -26. When we add them together, we get: -10 + (-26) = -36 Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = 12*r - 36. Our goal is to find out what \\"r\\" is. So, we need to move the -36 to the other side of the equation. We can do this by adding 36 to both sides: 0 + 36 = 12*r - 36 + 36 Which simplifies to: 36 = 12*r Now, to find \\"r,\\" we need to divide both sides by 12: 36 ÷ 12 = 12*r ÷ 12 When we do this, we get: 3 = r So, the answer is: r = 3!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Jan. 1, 2015, 11:43 PM GMT / Updated Jan. 2, 2015, 4:40 PM GMT Two men were arrested after one of them allegedly shot two West Virginia police officers during a traffic stop in Lewisburg Thursday — and then were found to be transporting two dead bodies in their vehicle, authorities said. The suspects are reportedly a father and son from Texas, with the father being the shooter, according to NBC affiliate WVVA. They were identified as Edward Campbell, 54, and Eric Campbell, 21, according to WSAZ. The Lewisburg police officers were wounded and expected to survive, West Virginia State Police said. The officers were shot after they pulled over a sport-utility vehicle with stolen license plates at 4 p.m. on Interstate 64, and a red Chevrolet pickup truck that was following that car pulled over as well, police said. Edward Campbell, the driver of the pickup, pulled out a handgun and shot both officers, police said. Donna Hinkle, director of administration at the Greenbrier County 911 Center, told NBC News that one was shot in the ribs but was wearing a bulletproof vest, and the other was grazed. One of the officers returned fire and wounded the driver of the SUV, Eric Campbell, in the leg. He drove off and tried to hide in a wooded area behind a guardrail, but surrendered about 90 minutes later, state police said. His father ran into the woods but was soon apprehended, police said. After the exchange of gunfire, police found two \\"recently deceased\\" bodies in the bed of the pickup truck, hidden under a mattress. The sheriff in Granville County, North Carolina told NBC affiliate WNCN that the bodies were those of Jerome Faulkner, 73, and his wife Dora, 62. The Faulkners were at their Oak Hill home when two men entered around 7 a.m. Thursday, according to Sheriff Brindell B. Wilkins Jr. The men reportedly set the couples house on fire and then stole their red Chevy pickup truck. It was unclear at what point the Faulkners were killed or how, and authorities did not have a potential motive yet for the killings. Both were arrested for malicious assault and attempted murder of a police officer. The shot officers were identified as Lt. Jeromy Dove and Patrolman Nicholas Sams with the Lewisburg Police. According to a news release, \\"they were taken to Greenbrier Valley Medical Center and are in good condition.\\" ||||| LEWISBURG, W.Va. (AP) — Two West Virginia police officers were injured in a New Year's Day shootout after a traffic stop involving a stolen SUV and a truck with two dead bodies inside, authorities said. The two Lewisburg officers pulled over an SUV around 4 p.m. Thursday on a highway outside of the city, Lt. Michael Baylous of the West Virginia State Police said in a press release. The SUV had a North Carolina license plate that showed it had been stolen. During the stop, a truck pulled over in the area. As the officers were conducting the stop, the driver of the truck shot at them with a handgun, wounding both officers, Baylous said. One officer returned fire, wounding the suspect in the leg. Baylous said the driver of the SUV fled the scene and hid but later turned himself in without incident. The driver of the truck also fled and was eventually taken into custody by the Greenbrier County Sheriff's Department, he said. The suspects' identities have not yet been verified but they claim to be father and son, Baylous said. During a search, authorities found two recently deceased bodies under a mattress in the bed of the truck, according to the news release. State Police did not immediately identify the victims, but North Carolina's Granville County Sheriff Brindell B. Wilkins Jr. told Raleigh TV station WRAL that the bodies were those of Jerome Faulkner, 73, and his wife, Dora Faulkner, 62. The sheriff told the station that the two suspects burst into the Faulkners' home near Oak Hill on Thursday morning, set the house on fire and took the couple and their SUV. Wilkins said it was not immediately clear why the two were targeted or whether they were killed in the initial attack or sometime later. The Associated Press could not immediately reach Wilkins late Thursday. The two Lewisburg officers and the suspected shooter were being treated for injuries that were not life-threatening, Donna Hinkle, administrator of the Greenbrier County 911 center, told the AP. The two suspects will be arrested on charges of malicious assault and attempted murder of a police officer in Greenbrier County, according to the news release. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"On January 1, 2015, two West Virginia police officers were injured during a traffic stop in Lewisburg involving a stolen SUV.

We have this equation: 0 = z + 15 - 11 Our job is to find the value of z. First, look at the numbers we have: 15 and 11. We need to subtract 11 from 15. 15 minus 11 equals 4. So the equation now looks like this: 0 = z + 4. Now, we want to get z by itself. To do that, we need to get rid of the 4. Think about it like this: if we have 4 candies and we take away 4 candies, how many candies will we have left? That's right, zero candies. So we will subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get z by itself. 0 - 4 = z + 4 - 4 Now, just like with the candies, when we take 4 away from 4, we get zero.

Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

What is the answer: In drinks, what ingredient is the difference between a White Russian and a Black Russian?","completion":"The primary difference between a White Russian and a Black Russian cocktail lies in the use of a single ingredient – cream (or milk). Both of these cocktails are built around the combination of vodka and coffee liqueur (typically Kahlúa), but the addition of cream in the White Russian gives it a distinctively different texture, flavor, and appearance compared to the Black Russian. Black Russian is a classic cocktail that dates back to the late 1940s. It was created by a bartender named Gustave Tops in Belgium for the U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg, Perle Mesta. The ingredients for a Black Russian are quite simple, consisting of vodka and coffee liqueur, which are mixed in equal proportions or with varying ratios depending on personal preferences. The mixture is then poured over ice in a short glass. White Russian, on the other hand, was introduced later, around the 1960s, as a variation of the Black Russian. The drink gained considerable fame after featuring in the 1998 movie \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" To make a White Russian, pour equal parts of vodka and coffee liqueur (Kahlúa) over ice in a glass and then add cream (or milk, for a less-rich alternative) to the drink, either by pouring it directly into the cocktail or by layering the liquid on top. The proportions of the ingredients in a White Russian can also be adjusted according to taste. The presence of cream in a White Russian not only gives the drink its characteristic opaque, creamy appearance but also contributes to a smoother mouthfeel and a slightly less potent alcoholic strength. The cream balances the strong flavors of both the vodka and the coffee liqueur, as well as adds a luscious element to the drink, which makes it a popular choice for those who appreciate a more indulgent cocktail. Conversely, the Black Russian offers a more straightforward and robust taste profile, highlighting the interplay between the vodka and coffee liqueur, and can be perceived as a bit stronger due to the lack of a creamy element to dilute the alcohol content. In summary, the difference between a White Russian and a Black Russian lies in the use of cream. The addition of cream to the vodka and coffee liqueur base in a White Russian results in a creamier, more luxurious drink with a slightly less potent alcohol flavor, while the Black Russian maintains a more direct approach to the combination of vodka and coffee liqueur without any added creaminess. Both drinks offer distinct experiences, with the White Russian catering to those who prefer a more indulgent cocktail, and the Black Russian catering to those who prefer a bolder, more unadulterated taste."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Where is Loki ultimately imprisoned? from the following article ? The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \\"Avengers Initiative\\". Agent Natasha Romanoff is sent to Calcutta to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract. In Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard.

Answer a question about this article: Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment. What does thermal mass reduce the need for?","completion":"Thermal mass reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment in a building. By effectively absorbing and storing heat from the Sun or other sources during the day and releasing it when the temperature drops at night, thermal mass helps maintain a comfortable and stable indoor temperature. This natural process of heat absorption and release reduces the dependence on artificial heating and cooling systems, such as furnaces, air conditioners, and heat pumps. Consequently, this can result in lower energy consumption, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and cost savings for the occupants of the building. The careful design and positioning of thermal mass elements, considering factors like climate, daylighting, and shading conditions, are essential for achieving optimal results in thermal energy storage and maintaining a comfortable indoor environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Because the gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on the opposite side. The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. I am facing a new situation today: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: On which side the Moon's gravitational field would exert weaker force, side A side B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, the Moon's gravitational field would exert a weaker force on Side B, which is the opposite side of the Earth from where the Moon is facing. The gravitational field created by the Moon weakens with distance from the Moon. Consequently, it exerts a slightly stronger than average force on Side A, the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and a slightly weaker force on Side B, the opposite side. The Moon's gravitational effect tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth does deform slightly in response to the tidal force, but its deformation is limited compared to the ocean water. Ocean water, being a fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly in the horizontal direction. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly. This results in rhythmic changes in sea surface height, as the ocean water never reaches equilibrium due to the constantly changing tidal force. So, given that Mike was reading about gravimeters and their use to measure the gravitational field of the Moon on Earth, it makes sense that the two distinct cases he encountered, Side A and Side B, would show very different consequences of the Moon's gravitational field. Side A, where the Earth is facing the Moon, would experience a stronger gravitational force from the Moon, while Side B, on the opposite side, would experience a weaker gravitational force. This difference in force leads to the tidal effects and sea surface height changes we observe on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Japanese sailor Kenichi Horie has finished a 110-day solo voyage across the Pacific Ocean in a boat pushed by sea waves to win another world first. Weak waves and ocean water movements made his arrival late, which was going to be in late May. \\"When waves were weak, the boat slowed down. That's a problem that needs to be solved,\\" the adventure told reporters from his boat in western Japan. His 9.5-meter-long boat can move like a dolphin's tail, and it rises or falls with the waves. Horie reached his destination in the channel between the main Japanese islands just before midnight after covering about 7,000 kilometers from Hawaii. Horie first made world record in 1962 when, at the age of 23, he became the first person to sail alone across the Pacific.

This data, while it does suggest that there might be a problem or a need for a change in organ donation awareness or policies, does not provide substantial evidence or information about the trustworthiness or character of the New Zealanders as a whole. To form a more relevant hypothesis from the given context, it would be ideal to focus on the aspects that are directly related to organ donation rates in New Zealand. Some potential hypotheses or factors to explore could include: 1. The lack of awareness on organ donation among New Zealanders, leading to decreased donor numbers. 2. Legal, procedural, or cultural barriers to organ donation in New Zealand, making it difficult for people to donate organs. 3. New Zealand's organ donation system might not be effective in facilitating the process, preventing potential donors from participating. On the other hand, if we wanted to draw a hypothesis about the trustworthiness of New Zealanders, we would require a different context that is directly related to their behavior or actions when it comes to trust, reliability, and honesty. Examples include contexts about crime rates, social behavior, business practices, or adherence to contractual obligations. In conclusion, while the decline in organ donation rates in New Zealand is a concern, it is not directly related to or indicative of the trustworthiness of New Zealanders. Generating a hypothesis on trustworthiness would require examining evidence and context that specifically address matters concerning trust, reliability, and honesty amongst the New Zealand population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There once was a king who offered a prize to the artist who would paint the best picture of peace. Many artists tried. The king looked at all the pictures, but there were only two he really liked and he had to choose between them. One picture was of a calm lake. The lake was a perfect mirror, for peaceful towering mountains were all around it. Over head was a blue sky with white clouds. All who saw this picture thought it was a perfect picture of peace. The other picture has mountains too. But these were rough and bare. Above was an angry sky from which rain fell and in which lightening played. Down the side of mountain ran a waterfall. This did not look peaceful at all. But when the king looked, he saw behind the waterfall a tiny bush growing in a _ in the rock. In the bush a mother bird had built her nest. There, in the midst of the rush of angry water, sat the mother bird on her nest... perfect peace. Which picture do you think won prize? The king chose the second picture.

First, simplify the left-hand side of the equation: 5505 + 10266 - 2952 = 12771 - 2952 = 9819 So now, the equation looks like: 9819 = 173*w - 6211 2.

Question: Who was brought up in the conversation of Mary's holiness? Context: It is admitted that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that \\"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\\". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \\"in every respect holy\\", \\"in all things unstained\\", \\"super-innocent\\", and \\"singularly holy\\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \\"the earth before it was accursed\\". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: \\"As regards the mother of God,\\" he says, \\"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \\"of every sort\\" (omni ex parte).

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The Internet has greatly changed the way people communicate. But some teachers think the changes are not all for the better. Eleanor Johnson, an English professor, thinks that text messaging has made students believe that it is far more acceptable than it actually is to just make terrible spelling and grammatical errors. And she says her students over the past several years have increasingly used less formal English in their writing. Words and phrases like \\"guy\\" and \\"you know\\" now appear in research papers. Professor Johnson supposes there is a strong relationship between the rise of informal online communication and an increase in writing mistakes. But she says there may not be much scientific information, at least not yet. David Crystal, a British linguist , says the actively changing nature of the Internet makes it difficult to keep up-to-date in studying its effects. But he believes its influence on language is small. The main effect of the Internet on language is the way it has added to the expressive richness of language, providing language with a new set of communicative tools that haven't existed in the past. Erin Jansen is founder of NetLingo.com, an online dictionary of the Internet and text messaging terms. She says the new technology has not changed existing language but has greatly added to its vocabulary. Basically it's freedom of expression. And what about those teachers who find these new kinds of mistakes in spelling and grammar in their students' work? What is her message to them? Erin Jansen said, \\"I am always on the students' side and won't get angry or upset about that. If it's helping the kids write more or communicate more, that's great. That's what teachers and educators want--to get kids communicating.\\" But Erin Jansen and David Crystal agree with Eleanor Johnson on at least one thing. Teachers need to make sure students understand the uses and rules of language.

Answer the following question: I already gave this example in another post but I think it was a really interesting situation with an interesting outcome so I’m going to repeat it. When I was 21 years old I produced a play. It was actually my second. The first was really successful. With the second I bit off a lot more than I could chew and I got too big for my britches and I ended up with a sprawling money eating disaster that caused me to have to move to a poor part of town and to go to court with my publicist and to be in debt for a couple of years. I could have absolutely let this ruin me and discourage me. And I realized this was a very delicate situation for my creativity and my sense of hope for the future. So I said to myself one day, “let me take a walk to the park and have this situation out with myself once and for all.” Two blocks from my house was this wonderful neo classical park with beautiful stairs leading from level to level. I walked up and down the stairs and basically said to myself “this was a failure. I am having a failure experience. But I have a choice of how I look at this. And the big Takeaway for me with this experience is that I have talent and there is a big creative future for me. And I have hope. I have to slow down. I have to make sure I don’t get ahead of myself. I definitely have to clean up this mess and be patient for however long it takes . But bottom line the big take away from this experience is that I have talent and I have a future and I have Hope.” It was one of the most amazing moments I’ve ever had with myself. There are about 100 other experiences in my life where I wish I had had a conversation like this. This one was a treasure. According to the above context, answer the following question.

Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend.

Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins (July 25, 1844 - June 25, 1916) was an American realist painter, photographer, sculptor, and fine arts educator. He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history. For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy. Eakins has been credited with having \\"introduced the camera to the American art studio\\". During his study abroad, he was exposed to the use of photography by the French realists, though the use of photography was still frowned upon as a shortcut by traditionalists. In the late 1870s, Eakins was introduced to the photographic motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge, particularly the equine studies, and became interested in using the camera to study sequential movement. In the mid-1880s, Eakins worked briefly alongside Muybridge in the latter's photographic studio at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Eakins soon performed his own independent motion studies, also usually involving the nude figure, and even developed his own technique for capturing movement on film. Whereas Muybridge's system relied on a series of cameras triggered to produce a sequence of individual photographs, Eakins preferred to use a single camera to produce a series of exposures superimposed on one negative. Eakins was more interested in precision measurements on a single image to aid in translating a motion into a painting, while Muybridge preferred separate images that could also be displayed by his primitive movie projector. After Eakins obtained a camera in 1880, several paintings, such as Mending the Net (1881) and Arcadia (1883), are known to have been derived at least in part from his photographs. Some figures appear to be detailed transcriptions and tracings from the photographs by some device like a magic lantern, which Eakins then took pains to cover up with oil paint. Eakins' methods appear to be meticulously applied, and rather than shortcuts, were likely used in a quest for accuracy and realism. An excellent example of Eakins' use of this new technology is his painting A May Morning in the Park, which relied heavily on photographic motion studies to depict the true gait of the four horses pulling the coach of patron Fairman Rogers. But in typical fashion, Eakins also employed wax figures and oil sketches to get the final effect he desired. The so-called \\"Naked Series\\", which began in 1883, were nude photos of students and professional models which were taken to show real human anatomy from several specific angles, and were often hung and displayed for study at the school. Later, less regimented poses were taken indoors and out, of men, women, and children, including his wife. The most provocative, and the only ones combining males and females, were nude photos of Eakins and a female model (see below). Although witnesses and chaperones were usually on site, and the poses were mostly traditional in nature, the sheer quantity of the photos and Eakins' overt display of them may have undermined his standing at the Academy. In all, about eight hundred photographs are now attributed to Eakins and his circle, most of which are figure studies, both clothed and nude, and portraits. No other American artist of his time matched Eakins' interest in photography, nor produced a comparable body of photographic works. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Is there anything else of note about his affiliation with the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia?","completion":"Thomas Eakins was an American artist who liked to paint, take photographs, and teach about art. He is very important in American art history because he liked to make his paintings look very real, just like real life. He used people from his hometown, Philadelphia, as his subjects in many of his paintings. Eakins was one of the first people to use a camera in the art studio, but some other artists didn't like this because they thought it was too easy. When he found out about using cameras to take pictures of things moving, he got very interested and wanted to learn more. He even created his own way of taking pictures of people and animals moving. He used photographs to help make his paintings better, like the painting of horses pulling a carriage called \\"A May Morning in the Park.\\" Eakins also liked taking photos of people without clothes because he wanted to understand how their bodies worked. He took many pictures of students and models and used them to teach about human anatomy. At the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Eakins worked with a man named Eadweard Muybridge, who was also taking pictures of things in motion. They did some projects together and learned from each other, but they had different ways of taking their pictures. Eakins took about eight hundred photographs during his life, which is more than any other American artist at that time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The pronoun \\"he\\" could potentially refer to either James or Robert. The sentence could be interpreted in two different ways: 1. The pronoun \\"he\\" refers to James: In this interpretation, it means that James asked Robert for a favor, but James himself refused the favor he had just asked for. This interpretation might seem odd, but without further context, it is still a possibility. 2. The pronoun \\"he\\" refers to Robert: In this interpretation, it means that James asked Robert for a favor, and Robert was the one who refused. This interpretation is more likely, as it would be a more common situation. To avoid ambiguity in such sentences, it would be better to use the appropriate noun instead of the pronoun \\"he.\\" For example: - If it refers to James: \\"James asked Robert for a favor but James refused.\\" - If it refers to Robert: \\"James asked Robert for a favor but Robert refused.\\" Alternatively, the sentence can be rephrased or additional context can be provided so that the intended meaning is clear. For instance: - \\"James asked Robert for a favor, but then he (James) changed his mind and refused.\\" - \\"James asked Robert for a favor, but Robert didn't agree and refused.\\" In conclusion, without adequate context, it is unclear whether the pronoun \\"he\\" in the given sentence refers to James or Robert.

Waiters in bowties dressed better than the patrons. DO NOT LET THE CHINTZY FACADE OUTSIDE FOOL YOU - this is serious business.

This was noted when the reservation was taken, and the hostess took great pains to make sure that everything was setup to accommodate his needs. If we needed water or bread or anything, a waiter was right there to provide it. THE FOOD: First and foremost, the tableside caesar HAS to be gotten. Anchovy, raw egg, the genuine article. I do not exaggerate when I say that we ate the salad one slice of Romaine at a time, as each piece had its own unique combination of elemental flavors. 'Elemental' was the watchword for the steaks, as well; simply beef plus time for aging in a controlled environment. Cut like butter, melted in the mouth, crisp on the outside and perfect-rare inside, sitting in a pool of savory juices. The salad and steak were so filling we split only a potato on the side, with butter and sour cream. It was good, not great, but hey, it's a potato - it can be done poorly or decently, there is no 'amazing potato'. The only slight miss was the creme brulee; the texture was a bit lumpish and it had clearly been kept in the fridge, then quickly blowtorched to melt sugar on top. The coffee was excellent. THE DRINKS: 2 martinis each, well-prepared, no complaints. THE BILL: For four mixed drinks, two salads, two steaks, one potato, two coffees and one creme brulee, 200.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive.

What is the relationship between 'equal pay act 1970' and 'act of parliament of the united kingdom'? A:","completion":"The relationship between the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom is that the Equal Pay Act 1970 is a specific legislation enacted by the UK Parliament. Both the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Equality Act 2010, to which it was mostly superseded, are examples of laws created by the Parliament of the United Kingdom to address issues within the UK. As mentioned, the Parliament of the United Kingdom is the supreme legislative body in the UK and its territories. It is responsible for creating, debating, and passing laws that govern the nation. The Equal Pay Act 1970 was one of these laws, addressing the issue of unequal pay and treatment between men and women in terms of their employment conditions. The Equal Pay Act 1970 was aimed at reducing discrimination and promoting equality in the workplace by ensuring that men and women received equal pay for equal work. The Act made it illegal for employers to pay workers of one gender less than their counterparts of the opposite gender under similar working conditions. In 2010, the UK Parliament passed the Equality Act 2010, which consolidated and updated various anti-discrimination laws, including the Equal Pay Act 1970. The new Act included a specific section (Part 5, Chapter 3) that addressed the issue of equal pay between men and women, effectively superseding the original 1970 legislation while continuing its primary objectives. In summary, the relationship between the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom is that the former is a specific piece of legislation enacted by the UK Parliament. The Equal Pay Act 1970 was aimed at addressing and reducing pay inequality and discrimination in the workplace, while the Parliament of the United Kingdom created this law and other legislation to govern the nation and address various societal and legal issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ambiguity of the term \\"working\\": If interpreting the term \\"working\\" strictly as being formally employed or paid for a specific job, it may not be possible to derive this information conclusively from the statement. The woman could potentially be a volunteer, a friend or family member assisting the restaurant staff, or engaging in other non-compensated work. 3. Context and circumstances: To make accurate assumptions regarding whether the woman is working, additional context might be necessary. The setting could be an informal gathering at the restaurant, where the woman is simply helping out friends or family. Alternatively, she may be an employee who is working outside of her primary role, perhaps aiding another department or demonstrating initiative. 4. Work classification: While the woman is evident to be performing a task, the classification of her work (part-time, full-time, temporary, etc.) remains indeterminable based on this statement alone. In summary, it is reasonable to deduce from the provided statement that the woman is actively engaged in performing a task associated with a job within the restaurant and so, is working. However, her formal employment status, the context of her work, and other related factors cannot be decisively established from the information provided. A more comprehensive understanding would call for further context and background information pertaining to the woman and the scenario described."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Portugal's economy is centered on what related to financial transactions?\\" Context: \\"Since the Carnation Revolution of 1974, which culminated in the end of one of Portugal's most notable phases of economic expansion (that started in the 1960s), a significant change has occurred in the nation's annual economic growth.[citation needed] After the turmoil of the 1974 revolution and the PREC period, Portugal tried to adapt to a changing modern global economy, a process that continues in 2013. Since the 1990s, Portugal's public consumption-based economic development model has been slowly changing to a system that is focused on exports, private investment and the development of the high-tech sector. Consequently, business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear and cork (Portugal is the world's leading cork producer), wood products and beverages.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Portugal's economy, since the shift in economic development model post-Carnation Revolution, has been focused on exports, private investment, and the development of the high-tech sector. This transformation was aimed at adapting the country to the rapidly changing global economic landscape and moving away from a public consumption-based model. A key aspect of Portugal's economy related to financial transactions is its focus on business services, which have surpassed traditional industries in importance. This includes activities such as banking, insurance, consultancy, and other financial services. These services play a crucial role in facilitating trade, investments, and fostering economic growth. The Financial Services sector has been steadily growing as a result of liberalization of the financial market and increased competition accompanied by the integration with international markets. Portugal's shift towards a more export-driven economy has implications for financial transactions as well. With increasing global trade, Portugal has worked towards the diversification of its export markets, focusing not only on European countries but also other regions, such as Asia, Africa and the Americas. This diversification exposes Portugal to global economic fluctuations, necessitating proper financial management. As mentioned earlier, the development of the high-tech sector is another crucial aspect of the Portuguese economy. The country has been investing in research and development, innovation, and technology, creating a fertile environment for start-ups and tech companies. The success of these ventures relies heavily on access to financing options, which can include venture capital, private equity, and other investment funds. Financial transactions within this sector facilitate the growth and expansion of the high-tech industry and contribute to job creation and overall economic growth. In addition to this, the tourism industry has seen significant growth in recent years, accounting for a significant proportion of the country's GDP. As a result, financial transactions related to foreign exchange, payment systems, and international transport providers play a vital role in this industry. Portugal has also taken steps to develop its capital markets, with the aim of facilitating the efficient allocation of capital to businesses and investments. The importance of this is underscored by the fact that Portugal is integrating itself into the Eurozone - which has implications for the country's financial sector, most notably in terms of fiscal and monetary policy. Lastly, Portugal's regulatory environment has been undergoing reforms to improve the overall ease of doing business and attract foreign investment. This includes changes to the tax system, corporate governance practices, and intellectual property rights protection. These improvements in the regulatory environment have a direct impact on financial transactions ranging from corporate financing to mergers and acquisitions. In conclusion, Portugal's economy is centered on several areas related to financial transactions, including business services, global trade, capital markets, high-tech sector development, tourism, and a favorable regulatory environment. The financial services sector plays a pivotal role in facilitating growth and enabling the country's transition towards a more modern, competitive, and innovative economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pair had spent an evening enjoying a movie and a meal before the police arrived at Hu's house. Body: Paul Flowers, who previously served as the chairman of the Co-operative Bank, was seen in Liverpool on Thursday night in the company of Reverend Hu, an ex-addict minister. Flowers' well-documented struggles with addiction and his fall from grace as a prominent figure in the financial world have kept him in the public eye over recent years. This recent incident only adds to his complex narrative. It appeared to be a typical evening on the town as Flowers and Reverend Hu were spotted attending a screening of the popular sci-fi movie Gravity. The film, starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, tells the thrilling story of astronauts attempting to survive in space following a catastrophic event. With its gripping storyline and impressive special effects, Gravity provides an ideal backdrop for an enjoyable night out for friends. After the movie, the pair proceeded to return to Hu's residence, likely for a quiet and relaxed conversation. The evening took an unexpected turn when, three short hours later, police arrived on the scene to arrest Flowers. The details surrounding his arrest have yet to be fully disclosed, raising questions about the reasons behind this sudden development. Reverend Hu, who currently lives in Liverpool, is an ex-addict who has dedicated his life to helping other individuals overcome their struggles with addiction. His dedication to aiding those in recovery may have brought him in contact with Flowers, who has faced significant challenges with substance abuse. This connection could prove crucial in understanding the events leading up to Flowers' arrest. Conclusion: As more information comes to light regarding the arrest of Paul Flowers, the public awaits answers about the circumstances surrounding this incident. The former bank chairman's ongoing battle with addiction and his association with the ex-addict minister, Reverend Hu, create a complicated story that many will follow closely.

Context: His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?' Winslow shook his head. He'd gained weight in his face recently and his jowls vibrated with the gesture.

Answer the following question: Process: - Contact is made with a virus - The virus enters the human or animal body - The virus goes to the part of the body that contains its food - The virus consumes part of the body or materials that the body uses - The virus replicates and spreads - The virus causes symptoms in the body as the immune system tries to expel the virus. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose having a strong immune system happens, how will it affect virus consumes more materials body uses. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having a strong immune system can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of a virus consuming more materials that the body uses. Direct effects: 1. Rapid immune response: A strong immune system will promptly detect the presence of the virus and launch a robust defense, utilizing its white blood cells (such as macrophages or neutrophils) to target and eliminate the virus. This rapid response may limit the virus's ability to consume more materials and hinder its replication process. 2. Production of interferons: A strong immune system will produce interferons, which are proteins that help cells resist viral infections by inhibiting viral replication and protein synthesis. This reduces the virus's ability to consume materials in the body and replicate further. Indirect effects: 1. Development of immune memory: A strong immune system may already have encountered a similar virus in the past, allowing it to have developed a memory of the pathogen. This helps the immune system to quickly recognize the virus and launch a more specific, efficient response through the use of B cells (plasma cells) that produce effective antibodies, and T cells (cytotoxic T cells) that can directly kill infected cells. 2. Reduced susceptibility to opportunistic/secondary infections: With a strong immune system, the body is less likely to be affected by other opportunistic or secondary infections during the course of the viral infection. This allows the immune system to focus more resources on fighting the original virus, thus reducing its ability to consume the body's materials. In summary, having a strong immune system can have a significant effect on preventing a virus from consuming more materials that the body uses. Both the direct and indirect effects work together to limit the virus's ability to spread and cause harm within the host, by promoting rapid elimination of the virus and preventing its replication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Using this technique, we examined the effect of viral IL-10 gene transfer on the prevention of tracheal allograft stenosis in an animal model.', 'On the day of tracheal transplantation, recipient Lewis rats were intramuscularly injected with either plasmid pCAGGS-LacZ or plasmid pCAGGS-viral IL-10, followed immediately by electroporation. Tracheas from Brown Norway donors were transplanted into the backs of Lewis recipients, and the histology of the grafts were assessed 2 and 4 weeks after transplantation.', 'The serum level of IL-10 peaked at 2000 pg/ml one day after injection; the level then slowly decreased, but was maintained above 1000 pg/ml until 8 days after injection. At Day 28, the airway lumina of the tracheal allografts were almost completely obliterated by fibroproliferative tissue in the control pCAGGS-LacZ-treated rats. In rats injected once with pCAGGS-viral IL-10, luminal obliteration was significantly decreased compared with the control pCAGGS-LacZ-treated rats (mean luminal opening 46.8% vs 0% p<0.05). The loss of epithelial cells lining the airway was also decreased in the IL-10-treated group (mean epithelial coverage 42% vs 5% p<0.05). Multiple injections with pCAGGS-viral IL-10 did not further improve the histological changes.Question: Does electroporation-mediated transfer of plasmid DNA encoding IL-10 attenuate orthotopic tracheal allograft stenosis in rats?","completion":"Answer: Yes, the electroporation-mediated transfer of plasmid DNA encoding IL-10 does attenuate orthotopic tracheal allograft stenosis in rats. According to the provided context, rats which were injected with pCAGGS-viral IL-10 showed significant decrease in luminal obliteration and less loss of epithelial cells lining the airway compared to the control group.

Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" I am facing a new situation today: Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Legend of Hell House Context: Physicist Lionel Barrett is enlisted by an eccentric millionaire, Mr. Deutsch, to make an investigation into \\"survival after death\\" in \\"the one place where it has yet to be refuted\\". This is the Belasco House, the \\"Mount Everest of haunted houses\\", originally owned by the notorious \\"Roaring Giant\\" Emeric Belasco, a six-foot-five perverted millionaire and supposed murderer, who disappeared soon after a massacre at his home. The house is believed to be haunted by numerous spirits, the victims of Belasco's twisted and sadistic desires. Accompanying Barrett are his wife, Ann, as well as two mediums: a mental medium and Spiritualist minister, Florence Tanner, and a physical medium, Ben Fischer, who is the only survivor of an investigation 20 years previously. The rationalist Barrett is rudely sceptical of Tanner's belief in \\"surviving personalities\\", spirits which haunt the physical world, and he asserts that there is nothing but unfocused electromagnetic energy in the house. Barrett brings a machine he has developed, which he believes will rid the house of this energy. Though not a physical medium, Tanner begins to manifest physical phenomena inside the house. When, after a quarrel with Tanner, Barrett is attacked by invisible forces, he suspects that Tanner may be using the house's energy against him. Meanwhile, Fischer remains aloof, with his mind closed to the house's influence, and is only there to collect the generous paycheck. Ann Barrett is subjected to erotic visions late at night, which seem linked to her lackluster sex life. She goes downstairs and, in an apparent trance, disrobes and demands sex from Fischer. He strikes her, snapping her out of the trance, and she returns to herself, horrified and ashamed. A second incident occurs a day or so later; this time, she is awake but uninhibited due to alcohol. Her husband arrives a moment later to witness her advances to Fischer. He is resentful, and spurns Fischer's psychic ability, claiming that \\"Mr. Deutsch is wasting one-third of his money!\\" Stricken by... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Legend of Hell House,\\" Belasco's final secret is ultimately revealed by Ben Fischer towards the end of the film. After a series of events and paranormal incidents in the Belasco House, the remaining characters realize that it is the malevolent spirit of Emeric Belasco himself that haunts the house and maintains control over the other spirits present. Throughout the story, the characters are tormented, manipulated, and subjected to various psychological and physical traumas perpetrated by Belasco's spirit. As the last surviving member of the original investigation 20 years earlier, Fischer overcomes his fear and resolves to confront Belasco by opening himself up to the psychic energies within the house. He ultimately discovers that Belasco orchestrated the entire situation by bringing them there, all as part of a sadistic experiment to test the limits of psychic phenomena and life after death. He used his knowledge, influence, and twisted desires to trap and control the spirits of the people he tormented in his mortal life. The final secret is unveiled when Fischer discovers Belasco's hidden chamber, which contains explicitdocumentation of his sadistic exploits, as well as his true resting place - a wine cellar where his embalmed body is hidden behind a brick wall. The key to ending the haunting lies in the realization that Belasco's spirit is trapped in the house by his own intense fear of the afterlife. He is not the towering, powerful figure he portrayed himself to be but was, in fact, a cowardly and insecure man. Fischer confronts Belasco's spirit, exposing his true nature and the source of his fear. He urges the other spirits trapped in the house to stop feeding Belasco with their own fears, thereby diminishing his power. Once his influence is broken, the spirits are at last freed, leaving the house cleansed of its malevolent energies. In conclusion, Belasco's final secret in \\"The Legend of Hell House\\" is the truth about his fear of the afterlife and his desperate attempts to maintain control over the spirits in his house. It is through this revelation that the characters break his hold, ending the haunting and liberating the trapped spirits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following context: Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (deltävlingar) in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show. Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round – the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen. Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004. The Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005. In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others.

(CNN) -- After sushi and ramen, Japanese beef is on the list of must-eats for many visitors to Japan. But other than knowing that it tastes great and costs a lot, many tourists turn up with little knowledge of what to expect from Japanese beef. Considered the caviar of beef in Japan, Wagyu (which literally means \\"Japanese cow\\") refers to specific breeds of cattle that come from a direct, traceable and pure bloodline. There are four Wagyu breeds: black (accounting for more than 90% of Wagyu beef), brown/red, shorthorn and polled. In recent years, efficient marketing efforts have elevated Wagyu to near-divine status among foodies. So, the easiest and tastiest place to get authentic Wagyu beef remains OPTIONS: - CNN. - Japan. - Japanese. - Kobe. - Wagyu.","completion":"Japan. Continuing the passage, it can be concluded that the easiest and tastiest place to get authentic Wagyu beef remains Japan. Being the origin of Wagyu beef, it is only natural that the most authentic and delectable experience of this prized dish can be enjoyed in the country. Additionally, Japanese chefs possess the knowledge and skills required to prepare and cook Wagyu beef in the traditional way, preserving its unique flavor, tenderness, and characteristics. Visitors to Japan have the opportunity to enjoy a wide range of Wagyu beef dishes, from steaks and teppanyaki to yakiniku and even sukiyaki. The country's culinary scene offers a vibrant array of eateries specializing in high-quality Wagyu beef; from high-end establishments catering to gourmands' refined tastes to more casual and affordable dining options. Japan also hosts several celebrated annual Wagyu events, which showcase the country's most prized agricultural products and provide opportunities for connoisseurs to savor this exquisite flecked beef in its purest form. Furthermore, Japan provides an unparalleled access to a variety of Wagyu breeds, including Kobe, which is one of the most well-known types of Japanese beef. Each region in Japan specializes in its own style of Wagyu, providing visitors with the chance to indulge in a myriad of delicate flavors and textures unique to each breed. For instance, Kobe beef is particularly famous for its marbling and melt-in-your-mouth tenderness, while Matsusaka beef is known for its high fat-to-meat ratio. In Japan, strict regulations set by the Japanese government ensure that Wagyu beef maintains its high quality and pedigree. These regulations cover breeding, rearing, feeding, and handling of the cattle, as well as the grading and labeling of the beef. This attention to detail is one of the reasons why Japanese Wagyu beef is considered superior to its variants from other countries. In summary, the most logical place to enjoy authentic and delicious Wagyu beef is undoubtedly Japan, where the traditional knowledge, rigorous standards, and a range of regional delicacies provide an unparalleled gastronomic experience for both tourists and locals alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences provide the location of an area or point of interest relative to two prominent nearby landmarks: the Sunset Memorial Gardens cemetery (or simply cemetery) and the Evansville Regional Airport. In Sentence 1, the area or point of interest is described as being south of the Sunset Memorial Gardens and east of the Evansville Regional Airport cemetery. The placement of 'cemetery' is a bit unconventional since it is mentioned at the end of the sentence, but the message conveyed is still consistent with that in Sentence 2. In Sentence 2, the area or point of interest is described as being south of Evansville Regional Airport and east of the Sunset Memorial Gardens cemetery. This sentence provides clearer information on the relationship between the area or point of interest and the two landmarks, with 'cemetery' being mentioned explicitly after 'Sunset Memorial Gardens.' In summary, while the structure and phrasing of the two sentences are different, they convey the same information about the location of an area or point of interest in relation to the Sunset Memorial Gardens cemetery and the Evansville Regional Airport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To the nearest whole number what is the value of absolute zero on the Celsius scale????","completion":"To find the value of absolute zero on the Celsius scale, I'll go through the following steps: 1. Remember the definition of absolute zero: Absolute zero is the lowest possible temperature and is the point at which all molecular motion ceases. 2. Recall the relationship between the Kelvin and Celsius scales: Both scales measure temperature, but they have different starting points. The Kelvin scale starts at absolute zero, while the Celsius scale starts at the freezing point of water. The relationship between the two is defined by the equation: K = °C + 273.15 3. Determine the value of absolute zero on the Kelvin scale: In the Kelvin scale, absolute zero is defined as 0 K. 4. Convert this value to the Celsius scale using the aforementioned equation: °C = K - 273.15 °C = 0 - 273.15 °C = -273.15 5. Round the result to the nearest whole number: The value of absolute zero on the Celsius scale, rounded to the nearest whole number, is -273."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Můj kodex cti jasně... Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The sentence \\"Můj kodex cti jasně...\\" translates from Czech to English as \\"My code of honor clearly...\\". This sentence seems to be incomplete and likely part of a broader context, where the speaker would expound how their code of honor clearly defines or dictates certain aspects or virtues fundamental to their character or conduct. The Code of Honor can represent a personal moral compass that categorizes the principles and ethics by which someone lives. It's a personal declaration of one's guiding values and beliefs and it often entails upholding virtues such as integrity, courage, honesty, loyalty, respect, and other values seen as crucial for one's personal, societal, or professional identity. This code delivers a schema to remaining honest, committed, and authentic amidst the complications, pressures, and circumstances of day-to-day life. It invariably adds substance and depth to an individual's personality and permits them to realize an elusive balance in fractious or controversial scenarios. To properly interpret and translate expressions, it's necessary to recognize the fundamental semantic constituents such as words, phrases, and sentences, and then reorganize these components in accordance to the grammatical syntax of the target language. In this case, the translated phrase maintains its original structure from Czech to English as: \\"Můj (My) kodex cti (code of honor) jasně (clearly) ...\\". Remember, incomplete phrases in any language could evoke curiosity or function as an effective tool for storytelling either by inducing suspense or deferring a conclusion or a revelation to a later point.

A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it seems that the provided answer option \\"plants growth\\" is not the most appropriate answer to the question \\"in what does a range of reproductive systems occur?\\". While it is true that a variety of reproductive systems can be found in plants, including sexual and asexual reproduction, discussing plants in this context would not address the information provided about roundworms. Roundworms, also known as nematodes, belong to the animal kingdom and have their own unique range of reproductive systems. In roundworms, we can find various types of reproductive systems, which include hermaphroditism (organisms that possess both male and female reproductive organs) and gonochorism/sexual dimorphism (organisms that have separate male and female individuals). Some roundworm species reproduce sexually, while others reproduce asexually through a process called parthenogenesis. The variety of reproductive systems in roundworms contributes to their adaptability and survival in different environments. Therefore, to answer the question accurately, it would be better to state that a range of reproductive systems occurs within the animal kingdom, specifically amongst roundworms, rather than in \\"plants growth\\". The animal kingdom features a wide variety of reproductive adaptations, including those found in roundworms, which enables organisms to thrive in diverse habitats and environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Supergirl is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Otto Binder and designed by artist Al Plastino. Supergirl first appeared in a story published in Action Comics #252 (May 1959) titled \\"The Supergirl from Krypton\\". Kara Zor-El is the biological cousin of Kal-El (Superman). After long-time Superman family editor Mort Weisinger retired in 1971, the character underwent revitalization under editor Joe Orlando and artist Mike Sekowsky. Wearing a series of new outfits, leaving her adopted foster home with the Danvers family, Linda goes on to San Francisco where she works for KSF-TV as a camera operator and develops a crush on her boss, Geoffrey Anderson. These stories introduced Supergirl's most memorable villain from this period: Lex Luthor's niece Nasthalthia, or Nasty. Nasty had made two appearances towards the end of Linda's college years, then pursued her to KSF-TV, trying to secure proof of her dual identity. Supergirl starred in her first solo eponymous monthly series beginning in 1972 until October 1974, when her monthly title merged with Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, and Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen to produce a new title: then-highest DC selling series called The Superman Family, where she eventually became the steady lead story. Linda worked as a student advisor at New Athens Experimental School, before leaving for New York to follow a career in acting with daytime soap Secret Hearts. In 1982 Supergirl received a second monthly solo series titled The Daring New Adventures of Supergirl, relocating the character to Chicago as Linda became a mature student of Psychology. Industry legend, and former DC Publisher, Carmine Infantino provided the pencilled art (Bob Oksner inked). With issue 13 the title was revamped, with a new costume design (sporting a red headband) and the title shortened to just Supergirl. The series ran until sudden cancellation in 1984, only two months before the character's debut in a big-budget Hollywood film starring Helen Slater. In the Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985) the greatest heroes from Earth-One, Earth-Two, Earth-Four, Earth-S, and Earth-X join forces in order to defeat the Anti-Monitor. When Superman comes face to face with the Anti-Monitor and is knocked unconscious, Supergirl rushes to save him before he is killed. She is able to fight him off long enough for Dr. Light to carry her cousin to a safe distance, but is killed by the Anti-Monitor. A public memorial service for Supergirl takes place in Chicago, where Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) delivers the eulogy. In her remarks she states \\"Kara is a hero. She will not be forgotten.\\" Superman then gives his late cousin burial by taking her corpse to Rokyn/New Krypton to Zor-El and Allura. A Superman issue the next month reveals that Kara had experienced a premonition about her own passing. However, when the universe is rebooted, the timeline is altered. Kara Zor-El and all memory of her is erased from existence. what happened during the bronze age","completion":"During the Bronze Age of comic books, Supergirl underwent revitalization under editor Joe Orlando and artist Mike Sekowsky.

Fossils can be used to match up rock layers. As organisms change over time, they look different. Older fossils will look different than younger fossils. Some organisms only survived for a short time before going extinct. Knowing what organisms looked like at certain times also helps date rock layers. Some fossils are better than others for this use. The fossils that are very distinct at certain times of Earths history are called index fossils. Index fossils are commonly used to match rock layers. You can see how this works in Figure 2.30. If two rock layers have the same index fossils, then they're probably about the same age.

Q:- Wind or water breaks small pieces off of a rock - The wind or water deposits tiny rocks - The rocks become known as sediment - The layers of sediment are pressed together by other layers of sediment on top - Minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The final step in the process you describe is the formation of a sedimentary rock. Here is a detailed process: First, let's review what we know from your description so far: 1. The process begins with weathering, which is when wind or water erodes or breaks small pieces off a rock. This is the initial stage of rock transformation. 2. These tiny pieces of rocks or debris, often transported by wind or water, get deposited in various locations such as rivers, oceans, and lakes. This process is known as erosion and deposition. 3. Over time, these collected rocks and debris, now known as sediments, settle in layers at their deposited location. The accumulation of these sediments leads to a distinct layering effect. 4. As more sediment is deposited, the layers at the bottom experience increasing pressure from the weight of the layers above. This process is called compaction. 5. Simultaneously, minerals from the rocks in the sediment dissolve due to the pressure and begin to act as a kind of natural glue, binding the various sediment particles together through a process called cementation. Now, let's move to your question about the final step: 6. Over a significantly long period (perhaps millions of years), the combined effects of compaction and cementation harden, solidify, and transform these layers of sediment into a sturdy, stable mass. This results in the creation of a type of rock known as sedimentary rock. Therefore, the last step of the process is sediment solidifying into sedimentary rock due to the effects of compaction and cementation. It's worth noting that this whole process is part of the larger geological cycle known as the rock cycle, a fundamental concept in geology that describes the time-consuming transformations between the three main types of rocks: sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. Grayson Clamp's parents tried everything to help their deaf 3-year-old son hear. But when a cochlear implant failed to fix his auditory disability, Len and Nicole Clamp turned to an untested method that had never before been used on children in the United States: an 'auditory brain stem implant.' After the chip was implanted, Grayson - who was adopted by the Clamps as a newborn after he was placed in foster care - could hear for the first time in his life. Scroll down for video. What's all that noise? 3-year-old Grayson Clamp hears for the first time. Clamp's face 'lit up' the first time he could hear his father. 'We don't know exactly what it's like for him,' Nicole Clamp told WBTV. 'We don't know exactly what he hears. His brain is still. trying organize itself to use sound.' Grayson is missing the cochlear nerves in his ears that allow humans to process the sounds that we hear. After the cochlear implant failed, the Clamps decided to participate in a research trial at UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where doctors were researching the use of the implant on children. Auditory brain stem implants have been used on adults in the U.S. since 1979. But researchers have never before tested the device on children - although, it is approved for use on children in Europe. The procedure requires doctors to implant a microchip into a patient's brain. The microchip then helps him recognize and process sound. Medical breakthrough: Clamp was the first child in the Unites States to receive an auditory brain stem implant. Surgery: To implant the device that now allows him to hear, Clamp had to undergo brain surgery. The technology is similar to that of a cochlear implant - using electrical stimulation - the brain stem implant uses electrical impulses to stimulate the brain, rather than the cochlea. To date, roughly 1,000 people have undergone the procedure, with varying degrees of success - most recipients of the implant only have an awareness of sound. It's described as being able to hear the beat, but not the melody. For Grayson, the device seems to be working - his parents say his face lit up when he heard his father's voice for the first time about three weeks ago. 'It's been phenomenal for us,' Len Clamp says.

Yes Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can conclude that Gloria Stavers was subjected to sexist attitudes from her editorial peers during her career. As one of the first women in the field of rock and roll journalism, Stavers likely faced a significant amount of sexism and criticism from her male counterparts. The term \\"Mother Superior of the Inferior\\" that was used by her detractors demonstrates this sexism directed toward her. It implies that she was viewed as a maternal or controlling figure in a domain that was largely considered to be inferior, likely because it focused on teen or celebrity content. This demeaning name was likely intended to belittle her accomplishments and undermine her authority as an editor in chief. Furthermore, the fact that she is credited with being one of the first female rock and roll journalists indicates that women were underrepresented in her field, meaning she likely faced additional obstacles related to sexism throughout her career.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Swimming pools, gas money and other expenses you didn’t know could be tax breaks If you started working on your tax return, you probably know to write off your mortgage interest and the check you wrote to the food bank. But what about your pet food or the swimming pool you bought last year? When it comes to the tax code, most rules are rigid and specific. But the IRS allows for some wiggle room when it comes to medical deductions and business expenses. It’s what has allowed people in unique situations to write off landscaping, tanning oil and even breast augmentation surgery. The catch is that the tax breaks depend heavily on each person’s unique circumstances. Treating a health condition is far from an exact science. And what could be a leisure purchase for one taxpayer may be a legitimate business expense for another. But that also means that taxpayers claiming a unique expense need to be ready to back up their write-off. Some of the taxpayers who have been successful with claiming more creative tax breaks have had to make their case in tax court. Still, taxpayers who spent a lot of money and energy researching and treating health issues, or who are writing off business expenses should take the time to make sure they’re writing off everything they can, accountants say. “Sometimes the rules are not black and white,” says Melissa Labant, director of tax advocacy for the American Institute of CPAs. “A particular expenditure may be deductible for one business but not another.” Here are some expenses you may not realize could lead to a tax break: Gas money. Taxpayers claiming the medical deduction can write off transportation costs for getting to and from doctor’s visits and other medical appointments. Of course, gas money alone won’t be enough to help them qualify for the tax break. Total medical expenses have to be greater than 10 percent of a person’s adjusted gross income, or greater than 7.5 percent if the person, or his or her spouse, is at least 65 years old. So people who already spent a substantial amount of money on surgery, exams and other treatment should make sure to include the cost of the gas, tolls and parking they needed to get to and from those appointments when filing for the tax break. Gas money or mileage and other travel expenses can also be deducted for business trips and for people who move beyond a certain distance for a new job, but aren’t reimbursed for moving expenses. Swimming pool. In rare cases, people who need a swimming pool for health reasons, say for physical therapy to help treat a chronic pain condition, may be able to write off the cost of the pool as a medical expense. But the write-off won’t come easy. Taxpayers may also have to show that the pool is not being used for any other purpose, Labant says, a feat that may be difficult when kids or grandkids are also splashing around in the pool. Some people may have to prove that it is too inconvenient for them to access a pool anywhere else, either because of distance or because of the severity of their condition, she adds. Home improvements. While most people won’t write off swimming pools, other home improvements, including the installation of hand rails, ramps or elevators may also be deductible if they are made for medical reasons. Taxpayers should keep in mind, though, that the deduction would be offset by any value the change adds to a person’s home. So say a homeowner spent 15,000 on an elevator and a property appraiser estimates that it increased the value of the house by 10,000. He or she would be able to write off 5,000 of the expense as a medical deduction. If the improvement doesn’t lead to any increase in property value, the entire expense is deductible. Conference costs. People who attended a medical conference to learn more about the ways to treat a condition affecting them, a spouse or a child may be able to write off the transportation costs and attendance fees as a medical expense. Most of the time at the conference must be spent attending sessions focused on medical information. Rent. Don’t celebrate just yet. The rent you pay is only deductible if it’s for a business. If you’re a renter who works from home, you may be able to deduct only part of your rent, according to the IRS. And even then, you need to meet the stringent rules for making business use of a home. That includes a requirement that the relevant section of your home be used only for business. (If your home office also doubles as your guest room, you may need to count it out.) Landscaping. Small business owners with a home office may be able to write off certain cosmetic improvements such as landscaping, lawn care and driveway repairs. One self-employed man who met most of his clients at home had success writing off part of his landscaping costs in 2001, leading to deduction of more than 11,000, when he showed that the section of his property receiving the improvements was used primarily for business. Pet food. In another rare case, the owners of a junk yard wrote off 300 in cat food. The taxpayers explained in tax court that they brought wild cats on to the property to help scare off snakes and rats. Therefore, the food needed to feed the cats was found to be a legitimate business expense. Most people will have a hard time meeting such particular circumstances, but the 2001 case could inspire some taxpayers to think creatively about their business expenses. These tax write-offs may not be a good fit for you, but the examples may be a reminder to make sure to give your tax return a close look. If you aren’t sure if something qualifies, check with the IRS or seek help from a tax pro. “Don’t assume something is nondeductible because you enjoy it,” Labant says.

She was previously a writer for MarketWatch and the Wall Street Journal. Summary:","completion":"The IRS tax code allows for some flexibility when it comes to medical deductions and business expenses, which has led to unusual tax breaks for some taxpayers in unique situations. Examples of such tax breaks include gas money for traveling to medical appointments, the cost of a swimming pool used for physical therapy, home improvements made for medical reasons, costs for attending a medical conference, rent for a home-based business, landscaping costs for a home office, and even pet food for a junkyard owner whose cats were used to scare off snakes and rats. However, these tax breaks generally depend on an individual's unique circumstances and may require the taxpayer to prove their case in tax court. Taxpayers are advised to consult with the IRS or a tax professional and not assume certain expenses are nondeductible just because they enjoy them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, we have this math problem: -50222 - 312034 = -8440*x - 41536 2. We need to find out what number \\"x\\" is. So let's start by looking at the numbers without the \\"x\\" first and simplify both sides of the equation. 3. On the left side, we have -50222 - 312034. Let's subtract these two numbers: -50222 -312034 -------- -362256 4. Now, our equation looks like this: -362256 = -8440*x - 41536 5. To find \\"x\\", we need to get rid of the -41536 on the right side. We do this by adding 41536 to both sides: -362256 + 41536 = -8440*x - 41536 + 41536 6. After adding, we get: -320720 = -8440*x 7.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. The message was sent in a traditional fashion instead of a digital one because the","completion":"sender believed that a physical, tangible form of communication held much more weight and significance in comparison to the often impersonal and seemingly fleeting nature of digital messages. When people receive a tangible message, be it a letter, postcard, or even a small parcel, there is an inherent sense of importance, of someone having taken the time to put thoughts into ink and placing it into an envelope that travels quite literally through space to end up in the hands of the recipient. The very act of putting one's thoughts onto paper conveys an emotional weight and intimacy that cannot be replicated with the simple taps of a keyboard and the swift push of a 'send' button. Moreover, sending a message in a traditional fashion also offers a level of privacy that digital communication often cannot guarantee. With concerns about cybersecurity and the potential vulnerability of personal messages sent over email or via more instant means, a tangible message exudes a sense of security that can only come from knowing that the only two parties privy to the contents of the message are the sender and the recipient. This, in turn, fosters an environment of trust and confidence between the two, fostering stronger, more meaningful relationships. Additionally, a traditionally sent message has an appeal that delves into the nostalgic aspects of communication. In a world where the majority of our interactions are digital exchanges, receiving a physical message harkens back to an era where people were perhaps more attentive and deliberate in their communication styles. This nostalgia can evoke a warmth and appreciation for the sender, demonstrating that they put thought and effort into reaching out to the recipient in a more sophisticated and personal fashion. Furthermore, the physical act of writing a message can be therapeutic and calming for the sender, allowing them to slow down and focus on the words they want to convey. The act of writing requires a certain level of mindfulness and reflection, which can encourage more thoughtful and genuine communication. As such, a message created in the traditional fashion may hold deeper meanings, insights, and emotions as opposed to quickly drafted and sent digital messages. Ultimately, sending a message in a traditional fashion not only emphasizes the importance of the message itself but also becomes an expression of the sender's care, thoughtfulness, and dedication to the recipient. It serves as a tangible reminder of the connection between two people, a snapshot in time that can be revisited, cherished, and preserved for years to come, unlike digital messages that may be lost among the digital clutter or entirely wiped away with the push of a button. As the world continues to rely more heavily on electronic communication, maintaining an appreciation for the art of traditional messaging serves as a poignant reminder of the power that lies within thoughtful and deliberate expression. In a fast-paced digital age, a simple piece of paper and its journey from one person's hand to another's can carry with it a mighty significance and form a lasting impact on the human soul."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Color Me Badd is an American contemporary R&B group that was formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The original members of the group were lead singer Bryan Abrams (born November 16, 1969), second tenor Mark Calderon (born September 27, 1970), second tenor Sam Watters (born July 23, 1970) and baritone Kevin Thornton (born June 17, 1969). They formed in 1985 and broke up in 1998 before reuniting in 2010, with various lineups since. As of 2016, they operate as a trio with Abrams, Calderon and Adam Emil. Context: Thornton and Abrams became friends in junior high school, and Watters and Calderon became friends in grade school. The four met in the mid-1980s while attending Northwest Classen High School in Oklahoma City. They were all members of the school choir. The group originally formed in 1985 as Take One, but changed their name to Color Me Badd to avoid confusion with an a cappella band named Take 6. Watters selected the name, after a horse at the racetrack named Color Me Bad. They aimed to be a vocal group in the vein of New Edition and New Kids on the Block. They first performed together in a school talent show, influenced by doo-wop a cappella groups of the past, such as Sam Cooke, The Temptations and the Four Tops. The group came up with a plan to spontaneously audition for any big name acts playing in Oklahoma City. They met Robert Bell of Kool & the Gang on May 27, 1987, when they were in Oklahoma City for a performance. They auditioned for him and he introduced them to his then-road manager, Adil Bayyan, who would become Color Me Badd's manager and convince them to move to New York City to pursue a record deal. They also sang for Huey Lewis and the News, Sheila E. and Ronnie Milsap, and opened for Tony! Toni! Tone! in Oklahoma City in 1988.

Read this: The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time, and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

I asked the lady behind the counter if they had any books on “Wicca.” She got excited and whisked me off to the metaphysical section of the store. She told me she was pagan and started handing me book after book into my arms. Soon I could barely see over the books in my arms. I mumbled behind the books, “Which ONE book would you recommend.” She then handed me Scott Cunningham’s book Wicca, A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner. I purchased the book and took it home.

The Innate, Ageless Appeal of Good Bordeaux Wine lovers middle-aged and older who cut their teeth on Bordeaux (I’m one of them) have never completely lost their respect for the region or their taste for the wines. It’s primarily younger wine drinkers, who had many more choices early on, for whom Bordeaux is irrelevant. The Bordeaux trade has worked hard to demonstrate to this group that good, inexpensive Bordeaux exists. This is indeed true. But it’s also true that many inexpensive bottles come from uninteresting terroirs and, even at their best, are not so good. In addition, those cheap bottles that do rise to the level of decent generally lack the immediate fruity appeal of, for example, an Argentine malbec. Perhaps the 20-and-under realm is not the best place to look for Bordeaux. I wouldn’t dream of telling marketers how to do their business, but I would contend that spending somewhat more money for a bottle with good provenance can do more to demonstrate the potential beauty of Bordeaux than selling boatloads of cheap but undistinguished bottles. In an informal test of this proposition, the wine panel recently sampled 20 bottles of Bordeaux from the 2011 vintage. We restricted our selection to the Médoc and Pessac-Léognan on the left bank of the Gironde. These wines are more expensive than those from lesser terroirs, but the region is the source for Bordeaux’s classic profile of relatively austere wines that are primarily blends of cabernet sauvignon and merlot. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Amanda Smeltz, the head sommelier at Bar Boulud and Boulud Sud near Lincoln Center, and Kimberly Prokoshyn, head sommelier at Rebelle in NoLIta. We chose the 2011 vintage because, although it was a complicated year, the wines were pretty good and readily available. What’s more, it was overshadowed by the highly touted 2009 and 2010 vintages. In my experience, the best place to look for values is in a good vintage that comes right after a year that has been deemed great. The 2001 Bordeaux vintage is a classic example. Along with its built-in millennial appeal, the 2000 vintage was hugely hyped by many critics. Bordeaux fans salivated after these wines regardless of costs. They paid far more per bottle than they would have for 2001s, a vintage that I actually prefer to 2000. The 2001s were appealing at an earlier age than the 2000s and, in many cases, are still preferable. I don’t mean to say that 2011 was a better vintage than ’10 or ’09. But it’s cheaper, and while many bottles require further aging, they do remind me a bit of the 2001s in that they will be ready to drink sooner than their predecessors. The tasting affirmed my sense that the 2011s offer a lot of pleasure. The best of these wines reminded me that Bordeaux excels at the classic mission of all wines: to refresh and to be a great drink with food. The fabled austerity of these wines may be an obstacle as an aperitif or for drinking in a bar, but with food, what otherwise may seem astringent comes off as cool, brisk and fresh. These qualities derive from the excellent acidity in many of these wines. We all agreed that the best showed a good balance of tannins and acidity, the elements that provide structure to a wine. The top wines were structured yet fresh, with nuanced aromas and flavors that were fruity, floral, herbal and mineral. We rejected wines that had lost the tension between ripeness and acidity, showing sweet and candied flavors. We also found more than a few wines that were dominated by oaky aromas and flavors, and marred by the bitterness of oak tannins. As a matter of course, we put a 100 limit on bottles selected for our blind tasting. This ruled out many of the top names. We also eliminated second labels. Most good producers offer second labels and sometimes third, wines that for one reason or another weren’t used in the top cuvée. They can be good, and are less expensive. But I always have the nagging feeling that they are not great values, especially those that trade on top names. Our No. 1 wine was the Smith Haut Lafitte from Pessac-Léognan, the northern part of the historic Graves region. It was a lovely bottle, fresh and lively, with complex flavors that included flowers, herbs and minerals. No. 2 was the Montrose from St.-Estèphe, bright, earthy and intense. These both were among the most expensive bottles in the tasting, at 100 and 80. For the vast majority of people, they simply confirm the notion that Bordeaux is for the wealthy, even though the 100 Smith Haut Lafitte 2011 is far less than the 175 you might pay for the 2010 vintage. I can’t defend Bordeaux prices except to say that the benchmark wine regions exist in a different world. You could liken Smith Haut Lafitte and Montrose to premier cru Burgundies or vintage Champagnes, or even Manhattan real estate. Their audience may be the 1 percent, but enough people pay the going rate, effectively putting them beyond the means of most others. Fortunately, alternatives exist. Our No. 4 bottle, the Potensac from Médoc, was our best value at 30. The vineyard is outside the boundaries of more elevated communes like Pauillac, St.-Julien or Margaux, but the stony, fresh, lightly tannic wine gives a clear taste of what the region is all about. Likewise, our No. 5 bottle, the Mongravey from Margaux, was rich and intense, yet harmonious with plenty of stuffing. Mongravey is little known, which accounts for the 32 price. Other wines to keep in mind include the earthy, spicy Grand-Puy-Lacoste from Pauillac; the deep, nuanced Domaine de Chevalier from Pessac-Léognan; the ripe, structured Malescot St.-Exupéry from Margaux; and the stony, floral La Tour Carnet from Haut-Médoc. At 40 to 70, none of these wines are inexpensive. Yet the region’s historical importance and the continuing quality of its wines are worth the occasional splurge, if only to create a mental context for Bordeaux and Bordeaux-style wines. That speaks to their intellectual attraction, but they appeal to the pleasure center as well. Bordeaux would not have centuries of history behind it if it did not. ★★★ Château Smith Haut Lafitte Pessac-Léognan 2011 100 Fresh and lively, with pretty aromas and flavors of violets, red fruits, spices and minerals.

(Frederick Wildman & Sons) Recipe Pairing: Fettuccine With Merguez and Mint Pesto These wines are well bred and can be counted on to deliver complexity, a sleek mouth feel often bolstered by tannins, balanced fruit and touches of smoke or spice. To justify their longstanding reputation at the table, be assured that the wines of Bordeaux can flatter a long menu. Lamb is a classic partner, but it’s not necessary to tiptoe chateau-style with a rack or roast leg. These wines, especially the youthful examples in our tasting, are not too high-toned to go someplace bold and rustic like Morocco. For this pasta dish, I opted for the North African lamb sausage, merguez, to which I added mint, garlic, lemon, sun-dried tomatoes, olives and a dusting of ground cumin. Thanks to some pasta water, these flavors all came together admirably to dress the pasta and suit the wine.

Haines (David Doremus). Mary Ellen matures into a wiser young woman and her childish fantasy of becoming a movie star gives way for a more reasonable and realistic ambition to go into medicine after reading up on it and developing an interest. She then works to gain an education as a medical worker, and becomes a nurse. However, when she ends up taking care of the people out in the country by herself, she concludes they need more medical expertise than she can offer them and continues studying medicine until she succeeds in becoming a fully-fledged doctor. Even though some people frown upon female doctors and she receives mixed support from her family, she refuses to let this stop her. Mary Ellen has a special relationship with each of her six siblings, but she is especially close to her younger sister Erin.

Five best and five worst from 49ers 45-3 win – Alex Smith’s Big Day: The 49ers quarterback threw out the first pitch in the Giants playoff opener against the Reds, the night before the 49ers-Bills game. The pitch was low and outside. Smith saw a few Bay Area columnists afterward, including the Chronicle’s Ann Killion, and he said the throw was terrible and seemed upset about it. The next day, Smith shredded the Bills under barrage of deep throws. In the first half, Smith had a career-high 237 yards passing and a career-best 158.3 passer rating. Smith surpassed the 300-yard passing mark for the third time but the first time in a win. He ended 19 of 24 for 303 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. –The 49ers wide receivers have been criticized for failing to get open deep and get open period. That was not the case against the reeling Bills. Michael Crabtree ran an impeccable pattern for a 28-yard touchdown catch just before the half. Then Mario Manningham completely lost the man covering him with a devastating cut to the outside on a 10-yard scoring pass in the fourth quarter. These receivers were no match for the Bills in man coverage. –Linebacker Patrick Willis got off to a slow start, even getting benched in favor of NaVorro Bowman against the Packers in the opener. No one would consider benching him now. Willis, the reigning NFC defensive player of the week, made seven tackles and forced a fumble against Buffalo, making him a candidate again for another player of the week honor. –Despite their woeful performance in the last two games, the Bills are not without defensive talent, particularly on the defensive line. Defensive end Mario Williams signed a 100 million deal before the season and defensive tackle Kyle Williams went to the Pro Bowl last year. The Bills also have Marcell Dareus, a high-round draft pick from last year. Yet the offensive line completely flattened them. With the offensive line pass protecting and opening holes in the run game, the 49ers had a 300-yard passer (Smith) a 100-yard rusher (Frank Gore) and two 100-yard receivers (Michael Crabtree and Vernon Davis) for the first time since 1961. –The offense dominated the Bills with its big plays and clever play-calling. But the 49ers also committed seven penalties on offense. Five of those plays wiped out another 110 yards of offense. The 49ers completely obliterated the Bills, but it was hardly a spotless performance. –Michael Crabtree went over 100 yards receiving, as did tight end Vernon Davis. But how excited should the 49ers really be? The Bills’ defense gave up six straight scoring drives the week before to the Patriots in a 52-28 loss in which the Bills surrender 45 second-half points. The real test will come when they face the Giants next Sunday at home and then the Seahawks four days later on a Thursday night. –It didn’t matter in this game, but through the first three quarters, the 49ers couldn’t get a sack on Ryan Fitzpatrick despite the fact the Bills were missing their starting left tackle and down to their third-string right guard. Fitzpatrick gets rid of the ball fast, but the 49ers should have applied more pressure. –Punt returner Ted Ginn Jr. looked like he did in 2010 as a punt returner. He was absolutely fearless last year, but in coming back after missing the first three games with an ankle injury, Ginn again looked tentative. If he doesn’t return to form, the 49ers might want to consider putting Kyle Williams back there again, as strange as that sounds. –Running back Brandon Jacobs was again inactive, despite his profession of health during the week. Either Jacobs isn’t as healthy as he thinks he is, or the 49ers figure they didn’t need him for this game. Jacobs is not a great special teams player and that might be keeping him in street clothes on Sundays. Nevertheless, they could use his short-yardage acumen. On the second drive of the game, the 49ers were at the Bills’ 1 on second down and eventually kicked a field goal.

Do you know the way to San Escobar? Probably not, it doesn't exist, but that didn't stop Poland's foreign minister claiming to have had a productive meeting with its officials this week. Witold Waszczykowski told reporters he met with various nations for Poland's bid to join the UN security council, \\"such as Belize or San Escobar\\". Mr Waszczykowski has been roundly mocked on Twitter, the one place San Escobar does now exist, flag and all. He said that he had had meetings with officials from nearly 20 countries, including some Caribbean nations \\"for the first time in the history of our diplomacy. For example with countries such as Belize or San Escobar\\". He put the slip down to tiredness. \\"Unfortunately after 22 hours in planes and several connecting flights you can make a slip of the tongue,\\" he said. He said he had in mind Saint Kitts and Nevis, a two-island Caribbean country known in Spanish as San Cristobal y Nieves. Twitter users responded in customary style, creating an official account and a flag for the island nation. One tweet said that San Escobar \\"fully supports Poland's candidacy to the Security Council\\". Another designed some currency, but added: \\"It's funny until you realise your only allies left are Belarus, Hungary and an imaginary nation state.\\" ||||| Witold Waszczykowski derided on Twitter after talk of lobbying non-existent country as part of bid for UN security council seat Poland’s foreign minister has become the subject of online derision after he said he had met the representative of a non-existent country as part of Poland’s campaign to get a non-permanent seat on the UN security council. Witold Waszczykowski was in New York to lobby for a seat on the council from 2018-19. On Tuesday, he told reporters he had held meetings with officials from nearly 20 countries, including some Caribbean nations “for the first time in the history of our diplomacy”. He then gave examples of countries “such as Belize or San Escobar”. The latter, as many people were quick to point out, does not exist. A spokeswoman for the Polish foreign ministry said it had been a slip of the tongue and Waszczykowski was thinking of Saint Kitts and Nevis, a two-island Caribbean country known in Spanish as San Crisóbal y Nieves. San Escobar (@rpdsanescobar) #SanEscobar State Council introduces a visa-free regime with Poland, and a visa requirement for @SealandGov citizens, starting Jan 15th. But the statement did not prevent social media users from jumping on the gaffe. Using #SanEscobar, Twitter users made jokes and even invented a flag for San Escobar. A Facebook page adorned with maps and photographs of the imaginary country was set up, including pictures purportedly of work on a huge statue of Waszczykowski being built to honour his contribution to bilateral relations between the two countries. One account, called San Escobar, has been tweeting policies and landscape photos of the non-existent nation for the past day. Another posted a picture of a San Escobaran banknote featuring a picture of Jarosław Kaczyński, the leader of Poland’s governing party. Waszczykowski’s error brought to mind the 1933 Marx Brothers film Duck Soup, in which the tiny nation of Freedonia, “Land of the Brave, and Free”, suffers from severe financial problems and receives a loan from a wealthy widower to stay afloat. The term Freedonia has since been used to refer to fictional countries in popular culture. While working on Candid Camera, Woody Allen played a practical joke by asking passersby what they thought of the bid for independence for Freedonia.

Globl Media Founder Claudia Chan Claudia Chan S.H.E. Globl Media, Inc. In 2010, Claudia Chan had a personal revelation that altered the course of her career: there were not enough female role models in mainstream media and that needed to change. By 2012, she had left her job as president of a women’s events company and founded S.H.E. Globl Media, Inc., a women’s media and education company. Since launching S.H.E., Chan has produced three annual S.H.E. Summits, attracting speakers including Samantha Power and Sallie Krawcheck, and has contributed to the national conversation around empowering women to become leaders and change-makers. Additionally, Chan's website features over 200 interviews with female entrepreneurs and leaders, and connects women across the country with mentors and tools to succeed in their personal and professional lives. Here, the New York native shares the apps that help her record ideas on-the-go and unwind after a busy day. To Empower the Mind: Bloom One of the things that you need to cultivate is self-confidence. We can only become what we believe. That dream that you have—whether it be to start a business, become a CEO or change the world with your nonprofit—will require a relentless belief in yourself. When you pursue anything that’s courageous, when you take risks, you just have to believe that your dream is possible. To do this, I write mantras. In the Bloom app, you write a mantra and it will pop up [on your phone]. You can even put them in a specific order. Find positive quotes and messages, and then set a reminder to think about them. The power of the mind is incredible. After a workout class, your energy is completely transformed. You have to get up for your own mental health. It’s so important to have those breaks in the day. Sometimes inspiration isn’t going to hit you when you’re writing an article or trying to come up with the next great idea to bring to a meeting. So I use Yoga Glo. It has all kinds of meditations, and I can get in 15 minutes of yoga flow. Anytime I get stuck, I just get up and move. When inspiration hits, honor it. Sometimes you have the best ideas when you’re lying in bed or in the car. I have an app called iTalk where I just hit record and get down my thoughts. I can capture all of my notes, because it’s such a shame to miss a great idea. Journaling is also a really good way to get your thoughts out of your head. I love that. I met the team behind Heads​pace at Arianna Huffington’s Thrive conference. They do a “Take 10,” which is 10 minutes of meditation. I love to listen to the meditations before I go to bed at night.

Q:Process: - A virus enters a host body - The virus has receptors that lock onto a target cell - The virus enters the cell - The virus uses the cell like a factory to make new copies of the virus - The new copies of the virus leave the cell - Infect other cells - The host gets sick as its cells are damaged. suppose a person is very healthy happens, how will it affect a SMALLER spread of the virus. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"A person who is very healthy may affect the spread of the virus both directly and indirectly, depending on various factors such as their immune system response, lifestyle habits, and exposure to external conditions. In the context of a smaller spread of the virus, the healthy individual's strong immune system could play a crucial role in inhibiting the viral infection process and preventing transmission to others. Directly impacting a step of the process: 1. Strong immune response: A healthy individual with a strong immune system has the capacity to rapidly respond to the presence of the virus in their body. This can involve the production of antibodies that recognize and neutralize the virus, impeding its ability to enter and hijack target cells. In this case, the immune response can directly affect the steps of \\"the virus entering the cell\\" and \\"using the cell to make new virus copies.\\" 2. Intact physical barriers: A healthy person tends to have strong and well-functioning physical barriers, such as skin and mucous membranes. These barriers act as a first line of defense against pathogens, including viruses. These barriers can effectively prevent the virus from entering the host body in the first place, directly impacting the first step of the process. Indirectly impacting a step of the process: 1. Lifestyle factors: A healthy individual typically exhibits positive lifestyle habits such as exercise, a balanced diet, optimal sleep patterns, and stress management. All these factors contribute to the person's overall health and resilience against infections. These habits might not directly impact specific steps in the viral infection process, but they influence the body's ability to mount an effective defense, potentially slowing down or even halting some steps in the process. 2. Unfavorable conditions for virus transmission: A very healthy person may also be more likely to practice proper hygiene, such as regular hand washing, sanitizing surfaces, and maintaining physical distance from other people, especially during a viral outbreak. Although such actions do not directly target the steps of the viral process, they can create unfavorable conditions for virus transmission, indirectly impacting the spread of the virus. In summary, a very healthy person's impact on the spread of a virus can be both direct and indirect, with factors such as the immune system response and various lifestyle practices influencing the course of the viral infection process. This can help to decrease the likelihood of a smaller spread of the virus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Once you have determined the area for your braid, divide your selected hair into three equal sections - left, middle, and right - by either using a comb or your fingers, ensuring a clean, neat separation. Now, you are set to commence the actual braiding process. Begin by crossing the left section over the middle section, thereby swapping their positions; the left section now becomes the new middle section, and the original middle section is now on the left side. Subsequently, cross the right section over the new middle section (previously the left section), effectively swapping their positions as well. The right section is now the middle section, and the original left section is on the right side. Continue this process of alternating sides and crossing the outer sections over the middle one, steadily working your way down the length of your hair. As you progress, ensure that you maintain consistent tension in the braid for a neat and polished appearance. To achieve varying styles and effects, experiment with different braid patterns, such as the traditional three-strand braid, the Dutch braid, the French braid, or even the fishtail braid. While braiding your hair, you may find it helpful to utilize a mirror or ask for assistance from a friend or family member to ensure that your braid is symmetrical, even, and precise. Be patient and take your time, especially if this is your first attempt at creating a man braid, as it may take a few tries to perfect the technique. Once you have reached the end of the braid, secure it with a small, tight hairband or a clear elastic, making sure to leave a small amount of hair past the band's end to prevent it from slipping out throughout your day. If desired, you may also apply a light-hold hair spray or a pomade to add extra grip and keep the braid firmly in place. Finally, style the remainder of your hair as you usually would, ensuring that it complements and accentuates your newly-created man braid. With this braided hair trend gaining popularity in recent times, you can enjoy a trendy, versatile, and eye-catching hairstyle that showcases your creativity and adds a unique, personalized touch to your overall look."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fishing is a popular outdoor activity and is often seen as an art form, as it requires knowledge, skill, and patience to be successful in catching fish. Fishing typically involves using a fishing rod with a line attached to a hook, bait, and a sinker. In some cases, a float or bobber may be used to keep the bait suspended at a desired depth in the water. Fishing can be done in various environments, such as freshwater or saltwater, and may require different techniques depending on the type of fish being targeted. Some common types of fishing include fly fishing, where an artificial fly is cast as bait, and lure fishing, where a hooked, artificial bait is used to mimic a prey animal's movement. The excitement Angie shows towards learning the art of fishing demonstrates her appreciation for the skills that go into the practice and eagerness to become adept at this craft. Tomorrow morning, she will meet Elsu, who will share his knowledge and expertise on fishing, potentially as a bonding experience or a means for Angie to become self-sufficient in providing for her needs.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: A battery is an electrochemical cell or series of cells that produces an electric current. In principle, any galvanic cell could be used as a battery. An ideal battery would never run down, produce an unchanging voltage, and be capable of withstanding environmental extremes of heat and humidity. Real batteries strike a balance between ideal characteristics and practical limitations. For example, the mass of a car battery is about 18 kg or about 1% of the mass of an average car or light-duty truck. This type of battery would supply nearly unlimited energy if used in a smartphone, but would be rejected for this application because of its mass. Thus, no single battery is “best” and batteries are selected for a particular application, keeping things like the mass of the battery, its cost, reliability, and current capacity in mind. There are two basic types of batteries: primary and secondary. A few batteries of each type are described next.

He was known as the \\"Sentimental Gentleman of Swing\\", because of his smooth-toned trombone playing. Although he was not known for being a soloist, his technical skill on the trombone gave him renown among other musicians. He was the younger brother of bandleader Jimmy Dorsey. After Dorsey broke with his brother in the mid-1930s, he led an extremely popular and highly successful band from the late 1930s into the 1950s. He is best remembered for standards such as \\"Opus One\\", \\"Song of India\\", \\"Marie\\", \\"On Treasure Island\\", and his biggest hit single \\"I'll Never Smile Again\\". - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States.

It was composed in 1906 by Charles A. Zimmermann with lyrics by Alfred Hart Miles. When he composed \\"Anchors Aweigh,\\" Zimmermann was a lieutenant, and had been bandmaster of the United States Naval Academy Band since 1887. Miles was Midshipman First Class at the Academy, in the class of 1907, and asked Zimmermann to assist him in composing a song for that class, to be used as a football march. Another Academy Midshipman, Royal Lovell (class of 1926) later wrote what would be adopted into the song as its third verse. - The swing era (also frequently referred to as the \\"big band era\\") was the period of time (around 19351946) when big band swing music was the most popular music in the United States. Though this was its most popular period, the music had actually been around since the late 1920s and early 1930s, being played by black bands led by such artists as Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Bennie Moten, Cab Calloway, and Fletcher Henderson, and white bands from the 1920s led by the likes of Russ Morgan and Isham Jones. The era's beginning is sometimes dated from the King of Swing Benny Goodman's performance at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles on August 21, 1935, bringing the music to the rest of the country. 1930s also became the era of other great soloists: the tenor saxist Coleman Hawkins and Chu Berry; the alto saxists Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges; the drummers Gene Krupa, Cozy Cole and Sid Catlett; the pianists Fats Waller and Teddy Wilson; the trumpeters Roy Eldridge, Bunny Berigan, and Rex Stewart. - From Here to Eternity is a 1953 drama film directed by Fred Zinnemann and based on the novel of the same name by James Jones.

Bobby soxers were usually teenage girls and young adult women from about 12 to 25. Fashionable adolescent girls wore poodle skirts and rolled down their socks to the ankle. In high schools and colleges, the gymnasium was often used as a dance floor; however, since street shoes and street detritus might damage the polished wood floors, the students were required to remove their shoes and flop dance in their bobby socks, hence the phrase \\"sock hop\\". - Robert Dean Stockwell (born March 5, 1936) is an American actor of film and television, with a career spanning over 70 years.

Columbia is the oldest surviving brand name in the recorded sound business, being the second major record company to produce recorded records. Columbia Records went on to release records by an array of notable singers, instrumentalists, and bands. From 1961 to 1990, its recordings were released outside the U.S. and Canada by the CBS Records label (which was named after the Columbia Broadcasting System) to avoid confusion with the EMI label of the same name, before adopting the Columbia name internationally in 1990.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C. In case A the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics. In case B the bacteria resists antibiotics. Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes. and a hint : Many mutations have no effect on the proteins they encode. These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. Please answer this question : In which case the organism would less likely have genetic disorder, case B or case C? Answer:","completion":"Case C would be less likely to have a genetic disorder. In this case, the bacteria do not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perish. This suggests that there may not be any significant beneficial mutations occurring, which means that there would be a lower chance of harmful mutations leading to genetic disorders as well. In contrast, Case B has bacteria that resist antibiotics, indicating the presence of beneficial mutations, which could increase the likelihood of harmful mutations and genetic disorders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"The 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI).\\" the correct answer? Available options: 1. yes 2. no","completion":"Option 1: Yes IHDI stands for Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. The statement \\"The 2010 Human Development Report introduced an Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)\\" is correct. To provide more context, the Human Development Index (HDI) was developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to measure and rank countries' levels of social and economic development. HDI is based on three key aspects of human development: life expectancy, education, and income. The primary purpose of HDI is to enable policymakers, researchers, and the public to assess the progress of countries over time and to evaluate policies intended to promote human development. However, HDI has been criticized for not fully taking into account the impact of inequality on human development. This is where the IHDI comes in. The IHDI was introduced to offer a more comprehensive picture of human development by adjusting the HDI for inequality. IHDI adjusts each country's HDI score for disparities in the three dimensions of human development, thus providing a clearer view of the distribution of opportunities and resources within a given society. IHDI is calculated using the \\"Atkinson family\\" of inequality measures, which is widely recognized for its ability to simultaneously capture both income and non-income inequalities. By incorporating inequality into the human development index, the IHDI underscores the loss of human development due to inequality. The IHDI enables policymakers and researchers to monitor the progress of countries in reducing inequality and helps identify areas where policy interventions are required. In summary, the IHDI, or Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, was introduced in the 2010 Human Development Report to provide a more accurate assessment of human development by accounting for inequalities within each country. The IHDI serves as a useful tool for policymakers, researchers, and the public to assess the progress of countries in promoting human development and addressing inequality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated / Source: NBC News An attorney representing one of six Baltimore police officers charged in the death of Freddie Gray said Friday that the officers did \\"nothing wrong\\" and he believes the choice to charge them was rushed because of media coverage of protests in that city and elsewhere. \\"In my 20 years, I have never seen such a hurried rush to file criminal charges,\\" said Michael Davey, who is representing Lt. Brian Rice, and was speaking on behalf of all the officers charged Friday with counts including manslaughter, assault and misconduct. Davey said State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby's decision to charge the officers, which came just a little more than two weeks after Gray's death and a day after receiving confidential investigation notes from the Baltimore police department, was an \\"egregious rush to judgment.\\" \\"I believe that the publicity in this case is driving force to a rush to judgment and causing this prosecution to move forth so quickly,\\" Davey said. \\"These officers did nothing wrong,\\" he said. The Baltimore police union also defended the six officers. Gene Ryan, a union official, wrote in a statement that \\"they are all committed police officers who have dedicated their careers to the Baltimore City Police Department.\\" \\"All that has been lost in all the publicity,\\" the statement said. The Baltimore lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police called for Mosby to appoint a special prosecutor that would decide whether or not to file charges against the officers. Baltimore Police Lt. Kenneth Butler said the department was \\"extremely frustrated and shocked\\" by Mosby's announcement. Mosby said Friday that Gray's April 12 arrest was illegal and his death a week later has been ruled a homicide.

In 1976, the federal government offered 600 million for building a regional rapid transit system, under a single regional authority. But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the person Messay Kebede argued had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba?, using the article: Ethiopian historians such as Taddesse Tamrat (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie have argued that modern Ethiopian studies were an invention of the 17th century and originated in Europe. Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 Storia d'Etiopia a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies. The philosopher Messay Kebede likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars to the understanding of Ethiopia's past. But he also criticized the perceived scientific and institutional bias that he found to be pervasive in Ethiopian-, African-, and Western-made historiographies on Ethiopia. Specifically, Kebede took umbrage at E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the Kebra Nagast, arguing that Budge had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba although the Kebra Nagast itself did not indicate such a provenience for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin. Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by Semitic immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien elements of both uncertain extraction and negroid origin., what would be the answer ?

Anne Gray, the National Gallery's curator, interpreted the scene chosen by Bellette: Although nothing is happening in this image, we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave her life for her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy.

She lost so much blood that she went into a coma and suffered a stroke that left her paralyzed. Many of her facial nerves were severed and she was left unable to speak or smile. Read More ||||| Melissa Dohme never thought she’d find love again after being stabbed 32 times by her ex-boyfriend in 2012 near her home in Clearwater, Florida. “I didn’t even want to open my heart up to anything,” Dohme, 25, tells PEOPLE. “I was afraid, but then I met Cameron.” Dohme and Cameron Hill, an emergency worker who helped carry her battered body from an ambulance and into a helicopter for lifesaving treatment on the night of her stabbing, connected about 10 months later at a luncheon in her honor. After four years of dating, the unlikely couple tied the knot on March 4 during a gorgeous ceremony at The Lange Farm in Dade City, Fla. A smiling Melissa, her last facial nerve reconstructive surgery in the books, said “I Do” in front of 200 friends, family and six of the firefighters, EMT and doctors who also helped save her life. “It was a full circle moment,” says Dohme. “I spent the worst and the best day of my life with Cameron.” “It was beautiful,” Hill, 42, tells PEOPLE. “I married the girl of my dreams.” Courtesy Amy Pezzicara/© Pezz Photo Dohme and Hill say they never expected to fall in love — it “just happened.” “Her strength was unbelievable,” says Hill. “That was the first thing I fell in love with.” For more on Melissa and Cameron, pick up this week’s issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday “It’s unbelievable where my life’s come from and where I am now,” says Dohme. “For so long, I felt when looking at myself, that I wasn’t myself and I always had something wrong with me. I didn’t want people to always have to give me sympathy or anything like that. “Cameron was so great, he would always just be there for me I think in every way, even if I was really upset or had a really rough day.” Courtesy Melissa Dohme The two quickly became inseparable and in 2015, Hill proposed to Dohme at a Tampa Bay Devil Rays game after she threw out the first pitch. “He’s my best friend, we’ve been such a team through [my healing],” says Dohme. “I wouldn’t want to be with anybody else!” Courtesy Amy Pezzicara/© Pezz Photo Dohme and Hill’s wedding was “like a fairytale” and Dohme says she’s happy, at peace and “so in love” for the first time in her life. “I just really couldn’t ignore how the crazy feeling inside that this is who I’m supposed to be with,” says Dohme, now an advocate for domestic violence prevention at Hands Across the Bay. “Life and love after abuse is possible.” |||||","completion":"Melissa Dohme's journey of recovered and resilience led her to a fairy tale wedding with her Prince Charming, Cameron Hill, on March 4, 2017, at the Lange Farm in Dade City, Florida. Their love story began in 2012 when a brutal attack by her ex-boyfriend left Dohme with 32 stab wounds and lying in a pool of blood outside her home. Hill, a paramedic, and his team arrived at the scene, where he had a premonition that he would see Melissa again. Dohme's injuries were life-threatening; she flatlined four times, went into a coma, and suffered a stroke that left her paralyzed. Thanks to countless medical procedures, including reconstructive facial surgery, Dohme regained her strength and became an advocate against domestic violence at Hands Across the Bay. After reconnecting months later, Hill and Dohme began dating and eventually got engaged in 2015. Their wedding was attended by 200 guests, including the first responders who saved her life, marking the couple's triumph against adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The integration of a B-axis in the upper tool carrier allows for greater flexibility and freedom in machining complex parts. This is because the B-axis has the ability to pivot up to 100°, enabling the tool carrier to reach various angles and positions that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to achieve. When it comes to highly intricate components and complicated contour elements, this added functionality allows for more precise and efficient machining. With this capability, the tool carrier can perform various operations, including milling, drilling, lateral drilling, and transversal threading, all in a single setup. This not only reduces the need for multiple setups but also improves overall accuracy, as there is less room for error when transferring parts between different machines. Milling, for example, is an essential operation for creating features on the surface of a part. With the B-axis, the tool carrier can approach the part at various angles, allowing for the creation of slots, pockets, and other complex shapes. This ability is particularly useful when working with intricate designs, as it provides greater control and precision. Drilling, on the other hand, involves creating holes in a material. With the B-axis in the upper tool carrier, drills can reach different angles for creating holes at unconventional orientations. Lateral drilling is a specialized type of drilling where a hole is drilled from the side of the material, while transversal threading involves cutting a screw thread across a hole. Both these operations can be achieved more easily using the B-axis, as it allows for superior positioning and flexibility. Ultimately, the addition of a B-axis in the upper tool carrier greatly expands the range of machining capabilities, particularly for complex parts and contour elements. By enabling the tool carrier to pivot by 100°, additional operations such as milling, drilling, lateral drilling, and transversal threading can be performed more accurately and efficiently, which is invaluable for creating high-quality, precision components."},{"prompt":"Q: One molecule of carbon dioxide consists of 1 atom of carbon and 2 atoms of what element?

What might be the first step of the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The first step of the process leading to earthquakes is the growth or formation of fault lines over time. This occurs due to the continuous movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, which are massive slabs of solid rock that make up the Earth's lithosphere. These plates constantly interact with one another, and their movements can cause the creation and growth of fault lines as they push, pull or slide past each other. The Earth's crust, which includes the tectonic plates, is broken into several major and minor plates. Their boundaries are often characterized by geological features, including fault lines. A fault line is a zone or planar fracture in the Earth's crust where the rocks on each side have been displaced relative to one another. As tectonic plates move over time, they can cause rocks on either side of the fault line to rub against each other. The pressure and friction from this rubbing can cause stress to build up within these rocks. Eventually, the stress becomes too great for the rocks to withstand, and they break or slip along the fault. When rocks break or slip along the fault, this releases a vast amount of energy. This energy then travels in the form of seismic waves, which propagate through the Earth's crust, causing the ground to shake and leading to an earthquake. The magnitude of the earthquake is determined by the amount of energy released, as well as the depth and type of the fault line, which can influence the behavior of seismic waves. In summary, the first step in the process of earthquakes is the formation and growth of fault lines due to the movement of Earth's tectonic plates. This sets the stage for subsequent steps, including the rubbing of rocks against each other, stress buildup, and eventual release of energy in the form of seismic waves that cause the ground to shake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The party is meant to be an intimate affair, with only three invited couples – Jack and Elizabeth, Sebastian and his wife Isabella, and the town's beloved philanthropist, Evelyn and her husband Richard. The Delmores plan an evening of lavish dining, cocktails, and suspenseful entertainment - a treasure hunt game where the guests work in pairs to find a precious gemstone hidden within the Delmore Mansion.

Dressed just as elegantly as the other guests, Mae and Edward effortlessly blend in. Despite not seeming to know the other guests well, there is an inexplicable allure surrounding them, making everyone else both suspicious and captivated. When asked who invited the unexpected couple, neither Sebastian nor Isabella can give a straight answer, claiming they must be friends of Evelyn or Richard. However, Mae and Edward continue to remain enigmatic and elusive.

Maria Lea Carmen Imutan Salonga, KLD (born February 22, 1971), known as Lea Salonga (), is a Filipina singer and actress best known for her roles in musical theatre, for supplying the singing voices of two Disney Princesses, and as a recording artist and television performer. At age 18, she originated the lead role of Kim in the musical Miss Saigon, first in the West End and then on Broadway, winning the Olivier and Theatre World Awards, and becoming the first Asian woman to win a Tony Award. Salonga is the first Filipino artist to sign with an international record label (Atlantic Records in 1993). She is also the first Philippine-based artist to have received a major album release and distribution deal in the United States, and one of the best-selling Filipino artists of all time, having sold over 19 million copies of her albums worldwide. In 1989 Salonga was selected to play Kim in the debut production of the musical Miss Saigon in London. Unable to find a strong enough East Asian actress/singer in the United Kingdom, the producers scoured many countries looking for the lead. For her audition, the then 17-year-old Salonga chose to sing Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg's \\"On My Own\\" from Les Miserables and was later asked to sing \\"Sun and Moon\\", impressing the audition panel. Salonga has sometimes credited \\"On My Own\\" as the starting point of her international career. She competed for the role with childhood friend and fellow Repertory Philippines performer Monique Wilson. Salonga won the lead role, while Wilson was named her understudy and given the role of the bar girl Mimi. For her performance as Kim, Salonga won the 1990 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Musical. When Miss Saigon opened on Broadway in 1991, she again played the role of Kim, winning the Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle and Theatre World Awards and becoming the first woman of Asian descent to win a Tony Award. In 1993 and 1996, she returned to play Kim on Broadway. In 1999, she was invited back to London to close the West End production, and in 2001, at the age of 29 and after finishing the Manila run of the musical, Salonga returned to Broadway to close that production. In 1990, Salonga performed in a homecoming concert in Manila entitled A Miss Called Lea. She also received a Presidential Award of Merit from President Corazon Aquino.

'The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn' released in 1967 was the debut album by which group????","completion":"\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is the debut album by the influential and legendary British rock band Pink Floyd. Formed in London, England in 1965, Pink Floyd became one of the most significant and innovative bands in the history of rock music, known for their unique blend of progressive, psychedelic soundscapes and thought-provoking lyrical content. The original members of Pink Floyd consisted of Syd Barrett (guitar, vocals), Roger Waters (bass, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals), and Nick Mason (drums). Released on August 5, 1967, \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" was recorded at the renowned Abbey Road Studios in London, the same location where The Beatles recorded most of their albums. The album's production was handled by Norman Smith, who had also worked with The Beatles in their early years. The title of the album was inspired by a chapter from the classic children's novel \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" by Kenneth Grahame, which describes a mystical experience involving the deity Pan. \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" showcases Pink Floyd's early psychedelic sound, heavily influenced by the creative genius of Syd Barrett, who was the band's primary songwriter at the time. The album's tracks traverse a wide range of sonic landscapes, reflecting the sensibilities of the burgeoning counterculture and the experimentation of London's underground music scene. The album contains 11 tracks, with some of the standout songs being \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"Lucifer Sam,\\" \\"Interstellar Overdrive,\\" and \\"Bike.\\" \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is a pioneering example of space rock, a subgenre that Pink Floyd would further develop throughout its career. With its innovative use of dissonant chords, swirling organ sounds, and otherworldly lyrics, the song paints a vivid picture of cosmic exploration. \\"Lucifer Sam,\\" on the other hand, is a more straightforward rock tune, characterized by its driving bassline and guitar riff, accompanied by cryptic lyrics about a cat that may also serve as a metaphor for a mysterious woman. \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" is perhaps the most iconic track on the album, an instrumental exploration that exemplifies Pink Floyd's early penchant for experimentation and improvisation. Clocking in at nearly ten minutes, the song features a hypnotic, repetitive guitar riff that gradually gives way to freeform, chaotic passages, interspersed with atmospheric sound effects and eerie tape loops. Finally, \\"Bike\\" is a whimsical and playful tune that provides a glimpse into Syd Barrett's unique imagination and quirky sense of humor, telling the story of a boy who wants to give his bicycle – along with a bevy of other eccentric items, such as a cloak, gingerbread men, and a mouse named Gerald – to a girl he likes. \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" was both a critical and commercial success, reaching number six on the UK Albums Chart. The album remains highly revered among fans and critics alike, and is considered one of the essential records in the history of psychedelic rock, laying the groundwork for Pink Floyd's subsequent masterpieces like \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" and \\"The Wall.\\" While Syd Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd was short-lived due to his deteriorating mental health, the band's debut album is a testament to his inimitable creativity and the lasting impact he had on the band's sound and legacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can use pins to seal the bag after you push out the extra air and fold it closed a few times.;","completion":"To choose the best solution for keeping a bag of cereal sealed securely after opening, let's assess both options using naive physics reasoning. Option 1: Using clothes pins. - Clothes pins have a strong clamping mechanism that is designed to hold fabric together, providing a secure grip. - They are typically larger and offer a better surface area for holding the folded bag closed. - Less likely to puncture the bag which can lead to possible spills and exposure to air. Option 2: Using pins. - Pins are smaller and have a sharp point designed to penetrate fabric, making them less ideal for sealing plastic bags. - The puncture created by the pin can potentially compromise the seal, allowing air and other contaminants in. - The smaller size of the pin may not be able to securely hold the folded bag closed, increasing the chance of it coming undone and exposing the cereal to air.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Every pet owner loves his pet. There is no argument here. But when we asked our readers whether they would clone (, )their beloved animals, the responses were split almost down the middle. Of the 228 readers who answered it, 108 would clone, 111 would not and nine weighed each side without offering an opinion. Clearly, from readers' response, this is an issue that reaches deeply into both the joy and _ . It speaks, as well, to people's widely differing expectations over the developing scientific procedure. Most of the respondents who favored the idea strongly believed it would produce at least a close copy of the original; many felt the process would actually return an exact copy. Those on the other side, however, held little hope a clone could never truly recreate a pet, many simply didn't wish to go against the natural law of life and death. Both sides expressed equal love for their animals. More than a few respondents owned \\"the best dog/cat in the world\\". They thought of their pets as their \\"best friend\\", \\"a member of the family,\\"\\"the light of my life.\\" They told moving stories of pets' heroism, intelligence and selfless devotion. Then the loss is so disturbing---and the cloning so attractive. \\"People become very close to their animals, and the loss can be just as hard to bear as when a friend or family member dies,\\" says Gary Kowalski, author of Goodbye, Friend: Healing Wisdom for Anyone Who Has Ever Lost a Pet. \\"For me, cloning feels like an attempt to turn death away...It's understandable. Death is always painful. It's difficult to deal with. It's hard to accept.\\" But would cloning reduce the blow? This question seemed to be at the heart of this problem. Options: A Can cloning make the pain one suffers less when a pet dies? B Can pet owners afford the cost of cloning? C Does cloning go against the law of nature?

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

No The given answer only provides information about the founding date and location of the headquarters of the Organization of American States (OAS). However, it does not address the actual goals of the organization. Let's elaborate further on the goals of the OAS. The Organization of American States (OAS) is an international governmental organization comprising 35 member countries from North, Central, and South America, as well as the Caribbean region. Its main purpose is to promote collaboration, peace, and security among its member states. The OAS is founded on four primary pillars: democracy, human rights, security, and development. 1. Democracy: One of the primary goals of the OAS is to safeguard and promote democratic values and practices across member states. The organization works to ensure the protection of democratic institutions, electoral transparency, and political participation through initiatives like electoral observation missions and dialogue facilitation. 2. Human Rights: The OAS is committed to protecting and promoting human rights in the Americas. It does this through the work of its human rights bodies, such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which investigate and adjudicate violations of human rights and advocate for their protection. 3. Security: Ensuring peace and security in the Western Hemisphere is another significant objective of the OAS. The organization focuses on reducing threats like terrorism, drug trafficking, and organized crime. Additionally, it promotes arms control, confidence-building measures, and conflict resolution to maintain peace throughout the region. 4. Development: The OAS works towards promoting economic and social development in the Americas through various projects and initiatives. These efforts are centered on poverty reduction, environmental sustainability, and the promotion of education, health, and labor rights. The organization aims to foster regional integration, capacity-building, and technical cooperation among member countries. In conclusion, while the basic information about when the OAS was founded and where its headquarters are located is relevant to understanding the organization, it is not sufficient to address the question about its goals. A more comprehensive answer, as provided above, outlines the main objectives of the OAS, including its efforts to promote democracy, human rights, security, and development in the Americas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow. - The barn swallow (\\"Hirundo rustica\\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\". - Petrochelidon is a genus of birds known as cliff - nesting swallows . The genus includes all of the five species of birds commonly called cliff swallow , and contains the following species : - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I can use this background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. Now, I have a new situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts. Answer this question please: In which time global temperature would less likey be in equilibrium, time A or time B? The answer is:","completion":"Time B would less likely be in equilibrium when it comes to global temperatures. This is because, as mentioned in the given background, the Greenhouse Effect plays a significant role in the balance of solar radiation and heat in the Earth's atmosphere. In Time A, during the 16th century, there were fewer greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere. This allowed for a more stable climate, as the solar energy was able to penetrate the atmosphere with relatively less absorption and trapping of the terrestrial radiation by the greenhouse gases. As a result, the equilibrium between incoming solar radiation and emitted terrestrial radiation was more manageable, leading to a more stable global temperature. On the other hand, Time B, representing the present century, has more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, will lead to a greater absorption and trapping of terrestrial radiation in the atmosphere. Consequently, the balance between incoming solar radiation and emitted terrestrial radiation becomes disrupted, leading to an overall increase in global temperatures. This imbalance in Time B means that the global temperature is less likely to be in equilibrium compared to Time A. The increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere exacerbate the Greenhouse Effect, contributing to the present-day issue of climate change, which is characterized by global temperature increase, melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. This shows that Time B is not just less likely to be in equilibrium relative to Time A, but also highlights the significance of human actions and their impact on global climate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can reduce your risk of skin cancer by using sunscreen. How to choose a sunscreen that offers the most protection is explained below ( Figure below ). Some people think that tanning beds are a safe way to get a tan. This is a myth. Tanning beds expose the skin to UV radiation. Any exposure to UV radiation increases the risk of skin cancer. It doesn’t matter whether the radiation comes from tanning lamps or the sun. Answer:","completion":"Benny"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the statement, \\"A little girl is taking the sheep for a walk,\\" it can be inferred that the girl is indeed holding a rope or some other means to control and guide the sheep as they walk, similar to walking a dog. However, several key elements are missing to conclusively link this to the premise given: 1. Crowd of people: The statement does not mention a crowd of people, only a girl walking the sheep. They might be walking in an isolated area or a populated area, but we cannot determine that from the information provided. 2. Holding a rope: Although it's likely that the girl may be using a rope to walk the sheep, the statement does not explicitly mention it. It could be a leash, a rope, or even a harness of some sort. Although not using a rope is less common, we cannot rule out that possibility. 3.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is an increase in appetite happens, how will it affect MORE regulation of blood sugar level being needed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of an increase in appetite can have an effect on the regulation of blood sugar levels. An increased appetite might lead to an increased intake of food, particularly carbohydrates, which will cause blood sugar levels to rise more frequently after meals. As a result, the pancreas will need to release more insulin to help the body absorb and manage the increased levels of glucose in the blood. This could potentially strain the pancreas and insulin production, and if the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to process the increased blood sugar levels, it could result in persistent high blood sugar. Over time, this can lead to insulin resistance and potentially the development of type 2 diabetes. Additionally, an increased appetite may lead to more frequent snacking or larger meals, which may result in blood sugar levels fluctuating more dramatically. This could require more frequent release of glucagon in response to low blood sugar levels. The constant fluctuation can put additional pressure on the body's regulatory system to maintain normal blood sugar levels. In summary, an increased appetite can lead to a greater need for blood sugar level regulation, as it may result in more significant fluctuations in blood sugar. This has a direct effect on the process, with the pancreas needing to work harder to produce insulin and glucagon in response to the changes in blood sugar levels."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In Triplicane the next morning, Rajan (Sivaji Ganesan), a radio engineer and communications researcher, is found murdered with his own hand gun. His neighbor Chinnaiah Pillai (P. D. Sambandam) hears the gunshot and complains to the police. A local Police Inspector named Purushothaman Naidu arrives and investigates the scene. He is joined by C.I.D. officer Sivanandam (Javar Seetharaman)there. He concludes that the killer is some petty thief who must have shot Rajan for the lump of money found in the same room of the crime scene. However, Sivanandam states that to be of a bad solution, as the amount of money matches exactly with the withdrawal entry in the bank passbook found in the same room, without a single rupee's difference. Nonetheless, it was clear Rajan was making plans to leave Chennai, in anticipation of the bombings. Rajan's wife Usha (Pandari Bai) is almost dumbstruck and unable to speak during any inquiries. Sivanandam and Naidu feel reluctant and embarrassed to do any questioning to her.The two decide to investigate the case by questioning the people in and around the house, who are the family members or friends of Rajan. They first do their inquiry with Chinnaiah Pillai, the neighbour as he is the first to inform them. He tells that the killer could probably be Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother (T. K. Balachandran). He recounts an incident (as flashback), in which Pattabi confronts Rajan at the house's garage to ask for his share of the family property to be apportioned and given to him. Rajan, in good faith, denies to give Pattabi his share, feeling that he and his wife might squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this would have kindled Pattabi to kill Rajan.Sivanandam and Naidu decide to inquire Pattabi.

Article: Sales of electric bicycles, or e-bikes, a hot item in consumer green tech, are expected to grow by more than 50% in North America during 2013. Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife. I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description. Question: According to the text,e--bikes are practical for _ . Answer: Choose from: 1). serious road cyclers; 2). couples spending a holiday; 3). people commuting to work; 4). professional mountain bikers; Answer:","completion":"According to the text, e-bikes are practical for people commuting to work. The article suggests that e-bikes are popular among those looking for an environmentally-friendly way to get to their workplaces, especially given the challenges of using traditional bicycles such as having to deal with sweat and the need for office-appropriate clothing. Also, e-bikes are a cost-efficient option with rising gas prices, making them an attractive mode of transportation for work-related commutes. Furthermore, they provide the added benefit of not fitting the motorized vehicle description according to U.S. federal laws. This means users can enjoy the convenience and speed of an e-bike without entailing additional costs and regulations associated with motor vehicles. The audience for e-bikes, however, is not limited to work commuters. The article also highlights that casual cyclers who enjoy an occasional help with hills and wind, or those who want to save money on buying a motorbike, can also find e-bikes useful. Despite their rising popularity and accessibility, the text clearly mentions that these e-bikes are not aimed at serious road cyclers or professional mountain bikers, thus eliminating options 1 and 4 from the given choices. In conclusion, among the options provided, the article strongly supports that e-bikes are a practical solution for people commuting to work. Although the article does not explicitly mention couples spending a holiday (Option 2), it does not refute that e-bikes could also be useful for leisure or recreational activities. However, based on the given choices and the specific context provided in the article, the most accurate answer is people commuting to work (Option 3)."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

News article: UN Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, Staffan de Mistura , informs the media at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, Monday, March 14, 2016. Mistura... (Associated Press) GENEVA (AP) — The Latest on Syrian peace talks that resumed in Geneva on Monday (all times local): 6:45 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the start of the pullout of the Russian military from Syria starting Tuesday. Putin said the move should help serve as a stimulus for Syria's political talks. The president said he coordinated the move with Syrian President Bashar Assad. Putin said that the Russian airbase in Hemeimeem in Syria's coastal province of Latakia and a naval facility in the Syrian port of Tartous will continue to operate. 6:40 p.m. Russia says it has voiced concern about cease-fire violations by U.S.-backed rebels in Syria. The Defense Ministry said Monday that the Russian military coordination center in Syria had a conference call with its U.S. counterpart in Amman about violations of the Russian and U.S. brokered truce by opposition units near Kafr Nabudah in Hama province. It says militants in the area have been listed by the U.S. as abiding by the cease-fire. The cease-fire that began on Feb. 27 has largely held, but both Syrian President Bashar Assad's government and its foes have accused one another of violations. The Islamic State group and al-Qaida's branch in Syria, the Nusra Front, are excluded from the cease-fire, which is intended to bolster indirect Syrian peace talks that began Monday. ___ 5:30 p.m. Residents say protesters have set fire to the security compound of an al-Qaida-linked group in northern Syria a day after the extremists swept through the town detaining U.S.-backed rebels. An activist based in the northern town of Maaret al-Numan says the situation on Monday is \\"tense and boiling.\\" He spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by the extremist group. In recent days the al-Qaida-affiliated Nusra Front has raided the bases of the Free Syrian Army's Division 13 and stolen weapons and vehicles acquired with U.S. support. Division 13 enjoys widespread support in Maaret al-Numan. ___ 5 p.m. U.N. agencies and key partners say they are starting to get basic supplies to besieged areas in Syria but haven't reached about 20 percent of those in urgent need and are \\"extremely concerned\\" about some 500,000 people. They said in a joint statement Monday that since the beginning of the year the U.N. and its partners have reached over six million people with aid through regular deliveries and recent convoys to besieged towns. But U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien and 10 other signatories said not enough aid is getting through and medical supplies and equipment are still being removed at checkpoints, which is \\"unacceptable.\\" ___ 3:30 p.m. The head of the Syrian government delegation to the indirect peace talks in Geneva says his side's discussions with U.N. special envoy for Syria were \\"positive and constructive.\\" Bashar Ja'afari told reporters after the meeting with Staffan de Mistura as the talks resumed on Monday in Switzerland that the government delegation \\"submitted ideas and views\\" for a political solution to the crisis. He says de Mistura will meet the representatives of the opposition on Tuesday and the government team again on Wednesday. Ja'afari says his team wants \\"to negotiate as Syrians under Syrian leadership without foreign intervention and without preconditions.\\" He says any party that opposes this premise is \\"trying to sabotage this round.\\" He was referring to the oppositions demands from the previous round that failed in early February, demands that had included an end to bombardment, release of detainees and the lifting of the siege by government troops on rebel-held areas across Syria. ____ 12:15 p.m. Russia's Foreign Minister says federalization is one possible option in Syria if it is the will of the Syrian people. Sergey Lavrov said Monday that Russia will support whatever solution the Syrian government and the opposition devise to end the country's war, including \\"any form (of government) whatever it may be called: federalization, decentralization, unitary state.\\" Speaking after a joint briefing on Monday in Moscow with his Tunisian counterpart, Lavrov also said countries should not launch attacks against terrorists in Libya without first receiving permission from the U.N. Security Council. Lavrov said discussions about equipping Tunisian special forces in their fight against terrorism are ongoing. ___ 11:15 a.m. The U.N. special envoy for Syria says a resumption of peace talks between government envoys and representatives of the opposition is a \\"moment of truth\\" and insists the \\"only Plan B available is return to war.\\" Staffan de Mistura spoke to reporters Monday moments before resuming \\"proximity talks\\" in Geneva, a month after suspending them in an upsurge in violence in Syria. The talks come as he said a \\"fragile\\" cease-fire has largely held since Feb. 27, and humanitarian aid deliveries have resumed in recent weeks. Many observers say the peace talks are the best chance in years to end a war moving into its sixth year, leaving at least 250,000 people dead and forcing at least 11 million people to leave their homes — many abroad. ||||| Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu to start the withdrawal of forces from Syria starting Tuesday. Russia will however keep a military presence at the port of Tartus and at the Khmeimim airbase to observe ceasefire agreements. “I consider the objectives that have been set for the Defense Ministry to be generally accomplished. That is why I order to start withdrawal of the main part of our military group from the territory of the Syrian Arab Republic starting from tomorrow,” Putin said on Monday during a meeting with Shoigu and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. \\"In a short period of time Russia has created a small but very effective military group [in Syria]... the effective work of our military allowed the peace process to begin,\\" Putin said, adding that with the assistance of the Russian Air Force \\"Syrian government troops and patriotic forces have changed the situation in the fight with international terrorism and have ceased the initiative.\\" To control the observation of ceasefire agreements in the region, Moscow will keep its Khmeimim airbase in Latakia province and a base at the port of Tartus, Putin said.

Next question: who has won the most oscars for costume design?","completion":"The person who has won the most Oscars for costume design is Edith Head, an American costume designer who had a prolific career in Hollywood spanning over five decades. Born on October 28, 1897, in San Bernardino, California, Edith Head's contribution to the film industry earned her significant recognition and accolades. Head has won a total of 8 Academy Awards for Best Costume Design, making her the record holder in this category. She has been nominated a total of 35 times, which is an outstanding achievement in itself. Her career began in 1924 when she started working in the costume department at Paramount Pictures, where she was eventually promoted to head designer in 1938. The list of the films for which Edith Head won the Academy Awards for Best Costume Design is as follows: 1. The Heiress (1949): This black-and-white film directed by William Wyler showcases exceptional costume design, earning Head her very first Oscar. 2. Samson and Delilah (1950): A biblical epic directed by Cecil B. DeMille, this movie was a major success and garnered Edith Head her second Academy Award for costume design. 3. All About Eve (1950): Head shared this award for costume design for black-and-white films with Charles LeMaire. Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the film is based on the life of an aspiring actress played by Anne Baxter. 4. A Place in the Sun (1951): This George Stevens-directed drama film featured dazzling costume design which led to Head's fourth win in the category. 5. Roman Holiday (1953): This charming romantic comedy, directed by William Wyler and starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, is yet another film that features Head's impressive costume design, earning her a fifth Oscar. 6. Sabrina (1954): This romantic comedy-drama film, directed by Billy Wilder and starring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, showcases Head's impeccable talent for which she received her sixth Academy Award for costume design. 7. The Facts of Life (1960): Head received her seventh Oscar for this comedy-drama film, which marked her first win in the costume design category for color films. 8. The Sting (1973): Edith Head's eighth and final Academy Award for costume design came with George Roy Hill's crime-drama film, starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. Edith Head's outstanding career solidified her status as a Hollywood legend, and her costume design style became synonymous with the glamorous look of Hollywood's Golden Age. She continued working up until her death on October 24, 1981, leaving behind a spectacular legacy that remains unparalleled in the world of costume design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:They were in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts. All around them, reminders of historic innovations that began with research at this legendary college. As the photographer clicked away, I wondered - what place in history would this photograph have? Will we look back at these 30 smiles and say, \\"That was the team that changed the world!\\"? If that is to be the case, there is a long road ahead. And indeed, it is long roads that are the motivation for this project. The MIT team is one of several working on Hyperloop, a vision for rapid travel put forth by Silicon Valley's most interesting man, Elon Musk. He says the commute from San Francisco to Los Angeles - currently a five-hour drive or an hour of flying - could be cut to 30 minutes. Hyperloop is a conceptual transport system in which passengers are loaded into pods and fired through vacuum tubes at more than 600mph (1,000km/h). Prototype pods have been tested running along magnetic tracks, much like the maglev trains used in countries such as Japan today. Pumping the air out of the tubes reduces resistance, allowing high speeds to be achieved, potentially using less energy than a train. The idea could reduce journey times over long distances, but there are many challenges for the rival developers to overcome before any such project can become a reality. Mr Musk is the boss of Tesla and founder of SpaceX, and when he published in 2013 a white paper outlining a way to use airtight tubes to propel pods at speeds of up to 700mph (1130km/h), he set a challenge to anyone and everyone who wanted to try and build the technology. Mr Musk isn't paying the firms, but he has committed to funding a series of tests. The hope is that these will happen in August this year. The target is that by 2021 humans will be travelling on Hyperloops around the world. The MIT team is one of more than 20 non-commercial groups also designing a Hyperloop pod - with money coming from SpaceX in the form of a competition. That was split over two phases - a design contest, which MIT won in January, and an on-track test coming up in the summer. But it all could be a colossal waste of time. The barriers to Hyperloop becoming a reality are enormous - and it's not just about technology. Part of any visionary's CV is the ability to ignore the naysayers and focus on your vision. If and when you succeed, everyone backtracks and says they knew you were a genius all along. Elon Musk is the sort of chap that is used to people telling him he's wrong. When he set out to make electric cars appeal to petrolheads, he had a lot of people to convince - but somehow, and on the brink of bankruptcy, he got some investors on board. Yet an awful lot stands in Hyperloop's way. Literally. Christopher Merian, chief engineer on MIT's effort, told me that the key problem with his pod - and the Hyperloop concept in general - is that it can't handle corners. So the Hyperloop tube would need to take a rather Roman approach, and go in an almost complete straight line from A to B. If the proposed route of San Francisco to Los Angeles is to be realised, you're looking at slicing through some of the most beautiful sights the natural world has to offer, not to mention acre after acre of land belonging to people who may not be too keen on a big fat tube being plonked outside their front door. Philippe Kirschen, MIT's team captain, told me he thinks this will lead to Hyperloop being built in a different part of the world with a less strenuous regulatory environment. Indeed it's hard to imagine anywhere in the US that would be suitable for Hyperloop, short of shelling out monstrous payouts and a free Tesla or two to people whose lives have been uprooted. But let's put that aside and, for the sake of argument, say an agreement has been made and a route between San Francisco and Los Angeles is built. It works, it's safe and it's pretty darn marvellous, all told. Except it is really, really expensive. Mr Musk says the cost of building the route would be in the region of 6bn (Â£4.1bn), an estimate most agree is extremely conservative. Some are calling Hyperloop the new Concorde which, despite being a glorious piece of innovation, ultimately failed due to regulations - it wasn't allowed to fly at supersonic speeds over land - and a lack of profitability. A return ticket on Concorde would see you part with several thousand pounds or dollars. Which over time was not considered to be worthwhile trade to save a few hours. How much will a ticket for Hyperloop cost? MIT's pod design - which they said can be scaled up - will likely be able to carry around 20 people at once. Unless the Hyperloop system can handle a great number of pods leaving a station in very quick succession, tickets for those pods will need to be extremely high in order to make the system economically viable. Furthermore, if Hyperloop runs from San Francisco to Los Angeles, it will be competing with the currently under-construction California High Speed Rail. The network - due to open in 2025 - promises a journey time of two hours and 40 minutes. Each train will be able to carry well over a thousand people. Tickets, surely, will be a lot cheaper than Hyperloop. It would leave Hyperloop as an option only for the rich. Public support no doubt would evaporate. I was something of a partypooper at MIT's event, I'll admit - putting all these points to the team on a night designed to celebrate their outstanding efforts thus far. The math(s) not adding up was a concern, they said - but at the very least, the hope is that developing Hyperloop will create something, even if it's not the transportation of the future. There could be many industrial uses for an environmentally friendly Hyperloop-style system. In 50 years, when we look back at the hopeful, expectant faces in that photograph, it seems unlikely that we'll see them as the team that changed the way we travel. But that's not to say developing Hyperloop - a clean, perhaps revolutionary technology - won't have been worth it.

Imagine getting inside a special pod that whooshes you through a long tube very, very fast. It's kind of like a super speedy train, but you travel inside a tube instead of on tracks.

He believes that with Hyperloop, people can travel very long distances in a short time—like going from San Francisco to Los Angeles in just 30 minutes! Wow, that's really fast! Right now, many teams of people, including one from a big school called MIT, are trying to make Elon Musk's idea come true. But it's a very big challenge because the Hyperloop needs lots of room to travel in a straight line, and it might cost a lot of money to build and use. Even though it's not easy, working on the Hyperloop project could lead to some great inventions that help people in other ways.

Write an article based on this summary: Theresa May says a Conservative government will not raise VAT if she wins the general election.","completion":"Title: Theresa May Pledges Not to Raise VAT Under a Conservative Government Introduction: In the run-up to the general election, British Prime Minister Theresa May has made a significant commitment on behalf of the Conservative Party, promising that a Conservative government will not increase the Value Added Tax (VAT) if she emerges victorious in the polls. This announcement comes as part of her broader efforts to attract voters and secure a strengthened mandate for her government. Step 1: Analyze the Background and Motive To better understand the context of May's announcement, it is crucial to analyze the background and motives behind it. Over the years, VAT has become a touchstone issue in British politics, with political parties varying in their stances on this tax on the consumption of goods and services. By explicitly committing not to raise VAT, May is taking a stance that could curry favor with a wide range of voters seeking relief from increasing living expenses. Step 2: Elaborate on the Impact of This Pledge on the General Population A promise to keep VAT the same under a Conservative government sends a message to the British public that the party is mindful of their financial concerns and committed to maintaining a stable environment for businesses and consumers. This commitment to avoid additional financial burdens for the general population could be a strategic move in winning over undecided voters. Step 3: Discuss the Potential Opposition Response It is important to anticipate the opposition's response to May's pledge. Labour and Liberal Democrat parties might attempt to exploit this declaration by raising concerns about how a Conservative government intends to maintain fiscal prudence without increasing VAT. They may question whether this would lead to more borrowing or cuts in public spending to offset lost revenue. Step 4: Contemplate Possible Outcomes Assuming May's promises holds true, and she does not raise VAT, this could lead to increased support and a stronger mandate for the Conservative government, engendering a sense of stability for the British economy. However, the pledge could also become a double-edged sword, as failure to uphold the promise could result in significant backlash and a loss of public trust. Conclusion: Theresa May's pledge not to raise VAT under a Conservative government has significant implications for the overall electoral strategy of her party in the upcoming general election. While the commitment attracts voters seeking financial relief, it also invites scrutiny from opposition parties. The ultimate outcome hinges on the Conservatives' ability to maintain fiscal prudence without resorting to an increase in VAT, as well as the public's trust in May to deliver on her promises."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Phyllis Hollenbeck, a primary care physician, took a job at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Jackson, Miss., in 2008 expecting fulfilling work and a lighter patient load than she had had in private practice. What she found was quite different: 13-hour workdays fueled by large patient loads that kept growing as colleagues quit and were not replaced. Appalled by what she saw, Dr. Hollenbeck filed a whistle-blower complaint and changed jobs. A subsequent investigation by the Department of Veterans Affairs concluded last fall that indeed the Jackson hospital did not have enough primary care doctors, resulting in nurse practitioners’ handling far too many complex cases and in numerous complaints from veterans about delayed care. “It was unethical to put us in that position,” Dr. Hollenbeck said of the overstressed primary care unit in Jackson. “Your heart gets broken.” Her complaint is resonating across the 150-hospital Veterans Affairs medical system after the department’s inspector general released findings on Wednesday that the Phoenix medical center falsified data about long waiting times for veterans seeking doctor appointments. In Washington, the number of lawmakers in Congress calling for the resignation of Eric Shinseki, the Veterans Affairs secretary, grew by late Thursday to nearly 100 — including almost a dozen Democrats — as President Obama prepared to receive an internal audit on Friday from Mr. Shinseki assessing the breadth of misconduct at veterans hospitals. White House aides declined to say whether Mr. Obama would ask Mr. Shinseki to step down. At the heart of the falsified data in Phoenix, and possibly many other veterans hospitals, is an acute shortage of doctors, particularly primary care ones, to handle a patient population swelled both by aging veterans from the Vietnam War and younger ones who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to congressional officials, Veterans Affairs doctors and medical industry experts. The department says it is trying to fill 400 vacancies to add to its roster of primary care doctors, which last year numbered 5,100. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “The doctors are good but they are overworked, and they feel inadequate in the face of the inordinate demands made on them,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut and a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. “The exploding workload is suffocating them.” The inspector general’s report also pointed to another factor that may explain why hospital officials in Phoenix and elsewhere might have falsified wait-time data: pressures to excel in the annual performance reviews used to determine raises, bonuses, promotions and other benefits. Instituted widely 20 years ago to increase accountability for weak employees as well as reward strong ones, those reviews and their attendant benefits may have become perverse incentives for manipulating wait-time data, some lawmakers and experts say. Representative Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, said whistle-blowers at several veterans hospitals had told his staff members that they would be threatened if they failed to alter data to make patient-access numbers look good for their supervisors, one reason he has called for a criminal investigation into the Veterans Affairs hospital system.

In Phoenix, the inspector general’s office said, investigators plan to interview scheduling supervisors and administrators to “identify management’s involvement in manipulating wait times.” But documents suggest that using the data in annual performance reviews may be commonplace. One review at a Pennsylvania veterans medical center showed that a significant portion of the director’s job rating was tied to “timely and appropriate access,” which would include waiting times for doctor appointments. One of those goals would be met only if nearly all patients were seen within 14 days of their desired appointment date — a requirement not found in the private hospital industry. Schemes to disguise wait times generally followed a handful of approaches, whistle-blowers and officials in Congress say. In Phoenix, where administrators were overwhelmed by new patients, many veterans were not logged into the official electronic waiting list, making it easier to cloak delays in providing care. Another strategy, according to documents and interviews, was for Veterans Affairs employees to record the first date a doctor was available as the desired date requested by the veteran, even if they wanted an earlier date. “Yes, it is gaming the system a bit,” one employee at the Veterans Affairs medical center in Cheyenne, Wyo., explained in an email to colleagues. “But you have to know the rules of the game you are playing, and when we exceed the 14-day measure, the front office gets very upset.” In Jackson, Dr. Hollenbeck reported that hospital administrators created “ghost clinics” in which veterans were assigned to nonexistent primary care clinics to make it appear that they were receiving timely care. And in Albuquerque, an employee at the veterans center said some doctors were shocked when they received a memo a few months ago stating that 20 percent of physician “performance pay” would be doled out only to doctors who found a way to limit patient follow-up visits to an average of two a year — a tactic to reduce waiting times by persuading veterans to make fewer appointments. “Clinic staff were instructed to enter false information into veterans’ charts because it would improve the data about clinic availability,” states a whistle-blower complaint filed by the employee, who did not want to be identified. “The reason anyone would care to do this is that clinic availability is a performance measure, and there are incentives for management to meet performance measures.” Experts point out that performance reviews and incentives were a crucial element in transforming the Veterans Affairs medical system, considered a medical backwater after the Vietnam War, into a national health care system that, for all its problems, is generally well regarded.

Draper, the director of the Health Care Government Accountability Office, said that performance-contract incentives were only one possible explanation for inaccurate wait-list data, and that other factors included lack of oversight and training. Photo Most experts agree that soaring demand for veterans’ care has outpaced the availability of doctors in many locations, and that high turnover is a major problem. In the past three years, primary-care appointments have leapt 50 percent while the department’s staff of primary care doctors has grown by only 9 percent, according to department statistics. Those primary care doctors are supposed to be responsible for about 1,200 patients each, but many now treat upward of 2,000, said J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents nurses and other support staff. He said the department spent too much hiring midlevel administrators and not enough on doctors and nurses, a complaint shared by some lawmakers and veterans groups. The department said this week that it was reviewing the size of patient panels at its hundreds of outpatient clinics and assessing whether more could provide night and weekend hours. The department also said it would increase the number of patients it referred to private medical care, to reduce waiting times. Critics and supporters of the department agree that many facilities do not have enough physicians. But they disagree about whether that is because the department has poured too much of its hefty federal budget increases into hiring midlevel managers instead of clinicians, or whether the system simply does not have enough funding — or a large enough pool of doctors to hire from — to keep up. Supporters of the department also note that hospitals everywhere are struggling to find primary care doctors. But some experts say the department has additional hurdles, including lower pay scales. Primary care doctors and internists at veterans centers generally earn from about 98,000 to 195,000, compared with private-sector primary care physicians whose total median compensation was 221,000 in 2012, according to the Medical Group Management Association, a trade group. Many veteran medical center directors tend to make 160,000 to 190,000; according to 2012 data, those directors given performance awards typically received 8,000 to 15,000 more. Dr. Atul Grover, chief public policy officer at the Association of American Medical Colleges, said the department’s doctor shortage came down to a simple fact: “It’s just harder to attract physicians to care for more challenging patients while paying them less.” There are long delays for specialty care, too, veterans say. Kent Carson, a former Marine with epilepsy, said he had tried to make an appointment with his neurologist at the veterans hospital in Nashville after having five seizures in four days in 2012. But Mr. Carson, 29, said he was told he would have to wait more than two months — or go to the emergency room. He has since switched to private insurance through his job as an accountant in Lenexa, Kan. The Nashville hospital did not respond to a request for comment. “I have seizures, but it’s not life-threatening,” Mr. Carson said. “But I really do worry about vets who have more serious problems.” ||||| Story highlights Obama accepts VA secretary's resignation, says Shinseki doesn't want to be a distraction Shinseki says his commitment to veterans drove his decision to resign The move comes after months of reports about problems with the VA medical system Eric Shinseki resigned Friday as the head of the Department of Veterans Affairs, leaving behind the daunting task of repairing a broken health care system that has left thousands of veterans at risk as they wait for medical care. Shinseki's resignation concluded a firestorm of criticism and growing calls for him to step down following revelations of sometimes deadly delays for veterans waiting for care at VA hospitals, allegations exposed by CNN in a series of exclusive reports. Details of the delays were first exposed by CNN last November in an investigation into two VA hospitals in the Southeast. Since then, CNN's reporting has expanded to include numerous other VA hospitals, culminating with details about secret waiting lists at the Phoenix VA that may have played a role in the deaths of 40 veterans. President Barack Obama went before reporters at the White House minutes after meeting with Shinseki, saying the retired Army general told him \\"the VA needs new leadership\\" to address widespread issues that were chronicled in new reports this week. Obama said Shinseki \\"does not want to be a distraction.\\" JUST WATCHED New details about Shinseki resignation Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH New details about Shinseki resignation 02:07 \\"That was Ric's judgment on behalf of his fellow veterans, and I agree. We don't have time for distractions. We need to fix the problem,\\" Obama said. Calls for Shinseki's resignation snowballed in recent days from across the political spectrum -- Republicans and Democrats, as well as veterans' advocacy groups -- because of the misconduct . In a farewell message to VA employees, Shinseki didn't address the scandal specifically but did say he resigned with veterans' interests in mind. \\"My personal and professional commitment and my loyalty to veterans, their families and our survivors was the driving force behind that decision,\\" he said. \\"That loyalty has never wavered, and it will never wane.\\" Shinseki says 'situation can be fixed,' but not by him Earlier Friday, Shinseki announced steps to address the VA shortcomings, including removing senior leaders in the Phoenix VA medical system , eliminating performance awards for VA leaders in 2014 and wait times as a metric for evaluations and accelerating care to veterans. He also apologized to veterans and Congress, but declared: \\"This situation can be fixed.\\" But Shinseki won't be part of the solution. He went to the White House to present Obama with findings from his internal audit of what was happening in the VA system, including that many audited facilities had \\"questionable scheduling practices\\" that signaled a \\"systemic lack of integrity.\\" The President acknowledged that scheduling issues didn't rise to the attention of Shinseki, whom he praised as a man who \\"has served his country with honor for nearly 50 years.\\" At the same time, Obama said that he and Shinseki agreed that a shift in leadership was necessary. For now, Sloan Gibson -- a Shinseki deputy -- will head the VA until a new secretary is named and confirmed. \\"Part of that is going to be technology. Part of that is management,\\" the President said. \\"But as Ric Shinseki himself indicated, there is a need for a change in culture within the VHA, and perhaps the VHA as a whole -- or the VA as a whole that makes sure that bad news gets surfaced quickly so that things can be fixed.\\" Breaking open the scandal Problems in the VA system date back decades, but CNN's reporting of long waits at VA hospitals brought the issue into national focus at the end of 2013. An April report by CNN in which sources said 40 veterans died at a Phoenix VA facility that used secret waiting lists to cover up the problem prompted angry calls for action. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care. CNN also obtained an e-mail written by an employee at a Wyoming VA clinic that said staff was instructed to \\"game the system\\" to make the clinic appear more efficient. A preliminary inspector general's report made public Wednesday described a \\"systemic\\" practice of manipulating appointments and wait lists at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix. According to the report, at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment or were placed on a waiting list at the Phoenix VA, raising the question of just how many more may have been \\"forgotten or lost\\" in the system. In a recent USA Today opinion piece, Shinseki ordered VA officials to contact each of these veterans \\"in order to bring the care they need and deserve.\\" The latest report by the VA inspector general's office and Shinseki's auditors indicated a link between employee bonuses and covering up patient wait times. There also have been calls for a criminal investigation into fraudulent record-keeping to cover up delays at VA hospitals. Obama said Friday that would be up to the Justice Department, which has been collecting information but has not launched any investigation. Shortly before he resigned, Shinseki told a veterans group that he was shocked by the inspector general's report, especially the prevalence of wait lists for veterans needing medical care. \\"That breach of integrity is irresponsible, it is indefensible and unacceptable to me,\\" he told the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans just before heading over to his final meeting with Obama. \\"I said when this situation began weeks to months ago and I thought the problem was limited and isolated because I believed that. I no longer believe that. It is systemic,\\" he said. At the same time, the VA chief of more than five years said that others had misled him. \\"I was too trusting of some, and I accepted as accurate reports that I now know to have been misleading with regard to patient wait times,\\" he said. \\"I can't explain the lack of integrity among some of the leaders of our health care facilities. This is something I rarely encountered during 38 years in uniform and so I will not defend it because it's indefensible, but I can take responsibility for it and I do.\\" Whistleblower: VA was 'way too focused on ... good numbers' As the accusations mounted -- including the latest one in which Reps. Mike Doyle and Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania claimed 700 veterans had been placed on a primary care waiting list for doctor appointments at the Pittsburgh VA center, with some waiting since 2012 -- so too did the pressure on Shinseki. Politicians largely applauded Shinseki's resignation on Friday, even as they said that the VA needed to do more than put new people in his place to resolve its shortcomings. \\"The denial of care to our veterans is a national disgrace, and it's fitting that the person who oversees the Department of Veterans Affairs has accepted responsibility for this growing scandal and resigned,\\" Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said in a statement. Meanwhile, a VA whistleblower who told CNN about the problems at the Phoenix facility said Friday he was saddened by Shinseki's resignation under such circumstances. \\"The VA administrators got way too focused on having good numbers and they forgot the most important mandate, the reason we all work at the VA -- to take care of veterans, to save their lives and give them good medical care,\\" Dr. Sam Foote said. \\"The next secretary's biggest challenge will be to get that refocused and make sure the number one job is taking care of veterans - not worrying about their bureaucratic careers,\\" Foote added. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Dr. Phyllis Hollenbeck, a doctor at a Veterans Affairs medical center, was shocked to find much longer work hours and larger patient loads than she had anticipated. Many doctors at the center ended up quitting due to the stress, which only increased the workload for the remaining staff. Dr. Hollenbeck ended up filing a complaint about the conditions, leading to an investigation that confirmed the hospital had too few primary care doctors. This problem was found to be common across many Veterans Affairs medical centers, with a shortage of doctors being the primary issue. This shortage resulted in long waiting times for veterans seeking care. It was also found that some hospitals were falsifying data about these waiting times, leading to increased calls for the resignation of the Veterans Affairs secretary, Eric Shinseki. Performance reviews and incentives were identified as one possible reason why hospital staff were falsifying wait-time data, as these reviews were linked to promotions, bonuses, and raises. An ongoing investigation plans to determine how exactly this played into the issue. Some healthcare workers reported practices such as creating \\"ghost clinics\\" in order to make it appear that care was timely, or recording the first available appointment date as the date requested by the patient. However, the problem boils down to a lack of doctors and an increasing patient load, causing wait times to soar, a problem the department is working to address. There are criticisms about whether the department has been hiring too many administrators and not enough doctors and nurses, or whether the department simply does not have the necessary funding. Repairs and improvements to the system are ongoing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Stress is fl natural part of everyday life.There is no way to avoid it, since it takes many and varied forms-driving in traffic,problems with personal relationships are all different forms of stress. _ .A certain amount of stress is vital to provide motivation and give purpose to life.It is only when the stress gets out of control that it can lead to poor performance and ill health. The amount of stress a person can withstand depends very much on the individual.Some people are not afraid of stress,and such characters are obviously prime material for managerial responsibilities.Others lose heart at the first sight of unusual difficulties.When exposed to stress,in whatever form,we react both chemically and physically.In fact we make a choice between \\"fight\\" or \\"fright\\" and in more primitive days the choice made the difference between life and death.The crisis we meet today are unlikely to be so extreme,but however little the stress,it involves the same response.All the energy is shifted to cope with the stress.It is when such a reaction lasts long,through continued exposure to stress,that health becomes endangered.Such serious conditions as high blood pressure and heart disease have established links with stress. Stress in some people produces stomach disorders,while others experience tension headaches.Since we cannot remove stress from our 1ires,We need to find ways to cope with it. Question: People are finding less and less time for relaxing themselves because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"they are suffering from the effects of stress\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the answer \\"they are suffering from the effects of stress\\" is not entirely accurate as the direct cause for people finding less and less time for relaxation. The primary reason people are finding less time for relaxation is due to the increasing pace of life and the habit of constantly rushing from one task to another, as mentioned in the article. This constant on-the-go lifestyle leaves people with hardly any time to sit still and do absolutely nothing, resulting in less time spent on relaxation. However, it is important to understand that the effects of stress are related to the lack of relaxation. The article emphasizes that stress is a natural part of everyday life and cannot be avoided as it takes various forms, such as driving in traffic or dealing with personal relationship issues. This stress, when experienced in moderate amounts, can be essential for providing motivation and giving purpose to life. It becomes detrimental when it gets out of control, leading to poor performance and ill health. The amount of stress an individual can withstand greatly depends on that person's ability to handle it. Some people are predisposed to thrive under stressful conditions, while others may crumble at the first sign of difficulty. Prolonged exposure to stress can eventually lead to serious health issues such as high blood pressure and heart disease. Since we cannot entirely eliminate stress from our lives, it is crucial to find ways to cope with it. One such method is setting aside time for relaxation. The article highlights that relaxation is essential for maintaining a healthy mind and body, so finding more time for relaxation will help alleviate the negative effects of stress. In summary, though the answer \\"they are suffering from the effects of stress\\" is not the direct reason people find less and less time to relax, the diminishing amount of relaxation time does coincide with increasing stress levels and their consequences. It is essential to incorporate relaxation into our lives to mitigate the effects of stress and maintain overall mental and physical well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When it comes to footwear, Marcus loves his birkenstocks and his flip-flops, but the","completion":"moment winter arrives, he quickly realizes the need for more supportive and warm options to protect his feet from the harsh cold. In the search for the perfect winter footwear, Marcus went on a mission to explore the wide range of choices available in the market, weighing the pros and cons of each amidst the countless styles, materials, and features. One of his first considerations was functionality. Given the unpredictable winter weather, Marcus needed boots that could withstand snow, sleet, and icy conditions. Thus, he began his search by focusing on waterproof boots with adequate insulation and a non-slip sole, as well as a gusseted tongue to keep water, snow, and debris out. Marcus was also keen on finding boots that offered a proper fit and support. He has slightly wider feet, so he required a boot designed for people with similar foot anatomy. In addition, adequate arch support and cushioning were crucial for his comfort, as he often spends long hours on his feet. Moreover, he wanted to avoid boots that would restrict his movements or cause any discomfort during extended periods of walking. As a fashion-conscious individual, Marcus didn't want to compromise on style while striving for functionality. He wanted winter boots that not only fulfilled his practical footwear needs but also complemented his wardrobe. He was drawn to some sleek designs that looked stylish and elegant, without looking too bulky, while still offering the necessary protection. With his preferences and requirements in mind, Marcus researched various brands and models to make an informed decision. He took note of customer reviews on multiple platforms, comparing durability, warmth, comfort, and overall performance between different choices. Furthermore, he consulted friends, family, and colleagues to get their opinions and personal experiences. Some options that caught his attention during his research were: 1. Sorel Caribou Boots: These boots are known for their excellent insulation, waterproofing, and durability. Marcus was particularly interested in the removable felt liner, which provides extra warmth and comfort to feet in even the most frigid conditions. 2. UGG Butte Boots: Marcus was drawn to UGGs due to their iconic appearance and reputation for cozy sheepskin linings. However, what truly sold him on the Butte model was their winter-ready Vibram outsole, combining functionality with the brand's trademark comfort. 3. Timberland Earthkeepers Original Leather 6-Inch Boots: Crafted with eco-friendly materials and offering a long-lasting, waterproof wear, Timberland's Earthkeepers caught Marcus' eye for their rugged yet stylish design. 4. The North Face Shellista III Mid: This boot's unique blend of style and function made it stand out to Marcus. The Shellista III Mid boasts a waterproof leather upper with a faux-fur collar, offering both warmth and a fashionable flair. After taking the time to try on different models and assessing their comfort, warmth, and compatibility with his wardrobe, Marcus finally settled on a pair of boots that struck the perfect balance of style and functionality. These boots not only kept his feet warm and dry during the harsh winter months but also allowed him to express his sense of style without compromising comfort. As the winter season wore on and the challenging weather conditions persisted, Marcus firmly believed he made the right decision in choosing his new winter boots. The endless compliments he received coupled with the satisfaction knowing his feet were protected and comfortable made every step of his journey well worth it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Membership declined throughout the twentieth century, but experienced an increase early in the 21st century, as have other small Christian denominations. Significant Protestant denominations are the Presbyterian Church and Methodist Church. Immigration has contributed to a growth in Hindu and Muslim populations. In percentage terms, Orthodox Christianity and Islam were the fastest growing religions, with increases of 100% and 70% respectively. Ireland's patron saints are Saint Patrick, Saint Bridget and Saint Columba. Saint Patrick is the only one commonly recognised as the patron saint. Saint Patrick's Day is celebrated on 17 March in Ireland and abroad as the Irish national day, with parades and other celebrations. As with other predominantly Catholic European states, Ireland underwent a period of legal secularisation in the late twentieth century.

By Lee Moran Last updated at 9:51 AM on 24th November 2011 She was ETA's green-eyed femme fatale - who lured policemen into her bed before calmly gunning down their colleagues days later. But Idoia Lopez Riano, dubbed La Tigresa (The Tigress) for her legendary sexual prowess, has turned from the organisation's heroine to hate-figure - after she renounced her violence and said sorry for her crimes. Riano, now 47 and who was locked up for 1,500 years in 2003, became one of the Basque Separatist group's leading commandos during the 1980s. Scroll down for video... Cuffed: Idoia Lopez Riano, dubbed La Tigresa, has renounced her past violence. Pictured here at Madrid's Barajas airport following extradition to Spain in 2001 The name of the organisation - Euskadi ta Askatasuna - means","completion":"Basque Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language. ETA was founded in 1959 in response to the oppression of the Basque people, their culture, and their language during the Franco dictatorship in Spain. The group sought to achieve an independent and socialist Basque country through armed struggle and targeted attacks against Spanish government officials, military personnel, and security forces. In its quest for independence, ETA was responsible for the deaths of more than 800 people and numerous bombings, kidnappings, and acts of sabotage. ETA's violent tactics were widely condemned both domestically and internationally, leading many countries, including Spain, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom, to designate it as a terrorist organization. This ultimately resulted in a crackdown on the group's activities, making it increasingly difficult for it to continue its armed struggle and leading to a decline in its membership and support base. The Tigress, as she was known, was hardly the only female member of ETA, but her high-profile violent acts and her notoriety for using sex as a weapon made her a powerful symbol for the organization during its peak. However, Riano's eventual renunciation of her violent deeds and her apology for her crimes illustrate how even the most committed and notorious members of the group could change their perspective on the path towards independence for the Basque people. She is just one of many former ETA members who have since denounced the group's tactics and sought to atone for their past actions. In response to the dwindling support and increased pressure from the authorities, ETA has experienced a significant transformation in the last two decades. In 2011, the group declared a permanent ceasefire and committed to a nonviolent strategy in its pursuit of Basque independence. Six years later, in 2017, ETA announced that it had completely disarmed, and in 2018, the group formally dissolved itself, officially bringing an end to one of Europe's longest-running and bloodiest separatist conflicts. As the Basque region enjoys increased autonomy and recognition of its unique cultural identity within Spain, the path to full independence remains a contested topic. Today, many Basques continue to advocate for greater independence through political means and peaceful activism. While the likelihood of achieving complete independence may be uncertain, the broader goal for many Basques is the preservation and celebration of their distinct language, culture, and identity within a unified and diverse Spain. Time will tell how the Basque people will continue to pursue their aspirations and what role their unique history will play in shaping their future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes.

Their commonplace life took an exciting turn when Laura, a former professional soccer player, develops a sudden obsession with the local underdog amateur soccer team, The Cloverdale Kickers, after witnessing one of their matches on television. One notable afternoon, Laura finds herself screaming at the TV, driven by her frustration as she watches the Kickers lose another game due to lackluster techniques. Kevin, who has always been supportive of his wife's eccentricities, grows concerned about Laura's deepening obsession and the sudden outburst. Laura's frustration isn't only fueled by the team's lack of success, but also her regret over a career cut short due to an injury. She sees potential in the Kickers but is upset at their lack of proper training and direction. Unable to bear watching the team lose, Laura decides to offer her help and ends up becoming the Kickers' new coach. Her appointment is met with doubts and disdain, especially from arrogant star player, Derek. Laura struggles but remains determined, and she tries every tactic and strategy to lead the team to victory. Kevin, understanding his wife's passion and past, becomes her silent pillar of strength. Meanwhile, Laura's loud confrontations with the TV continue, each based on their match performance. These scenes become the comic relief in this otherwise inspirational drama. Laura's fierce spirit and unrelenting perseverance eventually yield results, reforming the motley crew of amateur athletes into a formidable team. In the climactic final match, Laura's strategies outplay the reigning champions.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Raymond Colin Wilkins, MBE (14 September 1956 - 4 April 2018) was an English football player and coach. Born in a footballing family with his father and three brothers involved in the game, Wilkins played as a midfielder. He began his career at Chelsea, where he was appointed captain at the age of 18, and later played for the likes of Manchester United, Milan, Queens Park Rangers, and Rangers. He won 84 caps for the England national football team from 1976 to 1986, playing at UEFA Euro 1980 and the 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cups. Wilkins signed with A.C. Milan in the summer of 1984. He later remarked that the most difficult part of adapting to the Italian game was the focus on fitness - the coaching staff made him work to reduce his body fat levels and Wilkins described the result as being in the best shape of his career. The Italian team was struggling during this period, having suffered relegation in the 1981-82 Serie A, and Wilkins was joined by fellow Englishman Mark Hateley (himself replacing another compatriot - Luther Blissett). The only foreign players in the squad, the pair helped the team to victory over rivals Inter in the Milan Derby that October, winning plaudits from Italian press and the club's fans. In his first year there, Wilkins played 28 Serie A games to bring the team to fifth in the league and also won a runner-up medal in the Coppa Italia (having eliminated Inter in the semis). The following season he remained a key player in Milan's midfield, appearing in 29 league games and scoring two goals - one late goal to salvage a draw at Avellino and another goal the following game against Sampdoria. These were the only Serie A goals of his career. Overall, the team struggled for goals, with Pietro Paolo Virdis's total of 13 making him the club's only goalscorer in double figures that year. The club also suffered off the pitch, with owner Giuseppe Farina absconding to South Africa following accusations of bribery and theft. In Wilkin's final season there (1986-87), he fell out of the first team structure, following the signing of Roberto Donadoni and the continued presence of both Agostino Di Bartolomei and Alberigo Evani. The team finished fifth in the league, beating Inter twice, in Silvio Berlusconi's first year as owner. Wilkins played 105 games (74 in Serie A) for Milan between 1984 and 1987. Corriere della Sera eulogised him as a \\"serious and meticulous professional who was immediately appreciated for his long and precise passes\\". Wilkins signed for Paris Saint-Germain in the middle of 1987, but this proved to be short-lived: he failed to break into the team ahead of Gabriel Calderon and Safet Susic so he eagerly took the option to signed for Rangers for PS250,000 that November. At the Scottish club he won two league titles and one Scottish League Cup under Graeme Souness. He achieved cult status for his volley in the Old Firm game against reigning champions Celtic in August 1988, giving Rangers the lead in a 5-1 win against their rivals. Despite only playing two seasons for the Glasgow club, he was inducted into their Hall of Fame. Did he win any awards or recognition?","completion":"Raymond Colin Wilkins, also known as Ray Wilkins, was a talented football player and coach well-liked by fans and the press.

The footage, which quickly went viral, shows the officer using excessive force to subdue the student, an action that was not only shocking to the public, but also to the very authorities responsible for ensuring security and safety within schools. In response to the incident, the local sheriff publicly admitted that the video footage \\"made him want to throw up.\\" Following is an overview of the situation, its implications, and the reactions it has sparked. The Incident The incident occurred at a high school in the United States, where an altercation broke out between a student and a school resource officer. The situation escalated quickly, leading the officer to forcefully remove the student from the classroom, using techniques that were clearly not within the bounds of standard protocol. Although the exact reason for the officer's intervention is unclear, the video shows him employing a chokehold and slamming the student on the floor. Sheriff's Reaction Upon learning of the incident, the local sheriff expressed his horror and disgust at the officer's actions. In a public statement, he noted that the video \\"made him want to throw up,\\" underscoring just how troubling the footage is, even to law enforcement professionals. The sheriff emphasized that the officer's actions were not representative of the dedication and professionalism exhibited by the vast majority of officers within his department or other agencies. Legal Implications Following the incident, the school resource officer was placed on administrative leave and is now facing a thorough investigation by outside authorities. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, the officer could face disciplinary measures, including termination or even criminal charges. Beyond the individual officer, the incident has sparked a broader conversation regarding school resource officers, the use of force, and the need for better training and oversight. Public Outcry and Impact on Relations The disturbing footage has not only appalled the sheriff but also ignited a firestorm of public outrage. Parents, students, and community members have voiced their concerns and many are demanding immediate action to ensure that such an incident is never repeated. This event has further strained the already tense relationship between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve, and underscores the importance of promoting transparency and fostering trust. Conclusion The forceful removal of a student by a school resource officer is an incident that should concern all individuals involved in the education and protection of young people. The emotional response of the local sheriff is a powerful indicator of just how distressing the incident is. It is now crucial for law enforcement agencies to closely examine their policies and practices to prevent similar situations from occurring in the future. As we move forward, it is essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of all students and ensure that those sworn to protect them uphold the highest standards of conduct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Can you tell me the answer to when did the £100 note go out of circulation??","completion":"The £100 note has not gone out of circulation across the entirety of the United Kingdom, as its status varies between different issuing authorities in different parts of the UK. The Bank of England, which issues banknotes for England and Wales, never had a £100 note in regular circulation in its current series of banknotes. However, it had a £100 note known as the \\"White Notes,\\" which were last issued during the 1940s and were gradually phased out, being replaced by the £50 note as the highest denomination in circulation. On the other hand, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their respective issuing authorities, and they still have £100 notes in circulation. In Scotland, there are three issuing banks – Bank of Scotland, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Clydesdale Bank – all of which currently print and circulate £100 notes. Similarly, in Northern Ireland, there are four issuing banks – Bank of Ireland, Danske Bank, Ulster Bank, and First Trust Bank – all of which also issue and circulate £100 notes. While £100 notes are legal currency in the entire United Kingdom, they are less commonly seen, particularly outside of Scotland and Northern Ireland. Some retailers may be reluctant to accept these higher denomination notes due to the risk of forgery and their unfamiliarity. However, these notes remain in circulation in these specific regions and have not been phased out or withdrawn from the public."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge.

This holiday is a tribute to the contributions that workers have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of the country. Established in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labor movements grew, Labor Day was made a federal holiday in 1894. Labor Day traditionally marks the end of the summer season and is often celebrated with parties, parades, and various labor-related events. Many people enjoy outdoor activities like picnicking, barbecuing, or fireworks in the evening. It is also a time for many businesses to hold sales, and for sports organizations to hold games. This holiday historically is significant for the labor movement with roots tracing back to the Industrial Revolution, when workers were fighting for fair wages, reasonable hours, and safer working conditions. Protests and strikes were the main tools used by labor activists to seek reform. Therefore, if the question is \\"What holiday is the first weekend of September?\\" the correct answer would indeed be Labor Day, assuming the context is referring to holidays in the United States. It's important to note that the specific date for Labor Day can vary each year since it is not on a set date but rather observed on the first Monday of September."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What do Newton and Hannibal discover ? Movie plot title: Pacific Rim Movie plot: The film begins in 2013. Deep beneath the Pacific Ocean, a fissure opens up, that leads to another dimension. Through the fissure, a giant monster appears, and destroys portions of San Francisco. After many days and countless lives, the creature is defeated by human military forces.However, what seemed to be an isolated attack builds, as more creatures begin to come through the fissure, attacking coastal cities around the Pacific. The World unites to stop the invaders, and build The Jaeger Program: a series of giant mechanical 'monsters,' intended to stop the creatures.Original tests to have one pilot per Jaeger prove unsuccessful, as the test subjects were not able to handle the stress and strain of controlling such a huge robot by themselves. It was then decided that each Jaeger would be piloted by two pilots, their memories linked together in The Drift, synchronizing their movements to maneuver the massive machines.As the Jaegers go to work, they begin to turn the tides, and take down the creatures (known as Kaiju). Pretty soon, the world is enthralled by the Jaegers and their pilots. They become celebrities, and even have merchandise made. As well, the dead Kaiju are soon seen as a black-market commodity, their parts sold off for various collections and medicinal purposes.But just as the war seems to be turning in humanity's favor, the Kaiju's attacks become more frequent and more brutal.In 2020, seven years after the fissure opened, one of the more famous Jaeger duos, Raleigh Beckett (Charlie Hunnam), and his older brother, Yancy (Diego Klattenhoff) have become heroes with an impeccable record of defeating Kaijus. Pilots of the Jaeger named \\"Gipsy Danger,\\" they are sent off to stop a category 3 Kaiju heading towards Anchorage. The beast is larger and more powerful than previous category 3s and will be a challenge for the team. Though the information on their monitors shows a fishing boat in the path of the attack, the Becketts are told their priority is to protect Anchorage.Even so, they disobey orders,... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Pacific Rim, scientists Dr. Newton Geiszler (Charlie Day) and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb (Burn Gorman) play crucial roles in understanding the Kaiju threat and finding a way to close the interdimensional fissure from which the monsters emerge. Newton, a \\"Kaiju groupie\\" biologist, and Hannibal, a mathematician, are initially at odds with each other due to their contrasting methods. Newton is eager to study a living Kaiju brain in order to learn more about their origins and motives, while Hannibal is focused on predicting the patterns of their attacks based on his mathematical algorithms. However, after Newton mind-melds (Drifts) with a piece of a Kaiju brain, he discovers that the monsters are not just random creatures but are, in fact, bioweapons sent by an alien race called the Precursors. The Precursors are colonizers who want to wipe out entire planets' inhabitants and take them over. The Kaiju are genetically created with the sole purpose of eliminating human populations so that the Precursors can easily take over Earth. Furthermore, Newton's mind-meld with the Kaiju brain reveals that when a Kaiju is killed, the Precursors study the way it was defeated and then use that information to engineer the next generation of Kaiju, making them even more formidable. This explains why the category of Kaiju increases and why their attacks become more brutal and frequent. As the movie progresses, Newton and Hannibal eventually begin to work together, putting aside their differences, and combining their unique skill sets in order to come up with a viable solution. They theorize that the only way to end the threat once and for all is to close the interdimensional fissure and prevent any more Kaiju from entering our world. To achieve that, they figure out that a nuclear payload would need to be sent to the other side of the fissure to destabilize it, causing it to collapse and cut off the passage between the two dimensions. In conclusion, Newton and Hannibal discover the true nature, purpose, and origin of the Kaiju attacks, as well as the key to stopping the invasion. By working together, they devise a plan that ultimately leads to the closure of the interdimensional fissure and the end of the Kaiju threat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Finnish phrase \\"Useat ihmiset ovat saaneet surmansa.\\" can be broken down as follows: - 'Useat' means 'several' or 'many'. It's a pronoun that is used to refer to an indefinite quantity of something. More specifically, 'useat' refers to a large number that is more than two but doesn't specify the exact number. - 'Ihmiset' means 'people'. It's the plural form of 'ihminen', which translates to 'person'. Finnish uses the same plural form regardless of the gender of the people being referred to. - 'Ovat saaneet surmansa.' translates to 'have lost their lives.' It's a verb phrase in the past tense. - 'Ovat' is the third person plural present tense of the verb \\"olla\\", meaning \\"to be\\". In this context, it's used as a helper verb to form the perfect tense. - 'Saaneet' is the past participle of 'saada', which means 'to get' or 'to receive'. In this context, it's used in combination with 'ovat' to form the perfect tense. - 'Surmansa' is a possessive form of 'surma', which means 'death'. The '-nsa' ending indicates that the death belongs to the 'useat ihmiset' (several people). So, \\"Useat ihmiset ovat saaneet surmansa.\\" is basically stating that a large, but unspecified, number of people have lost their lives or died.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Were Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane both poets? Answer:","completion":"While both Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane were renowned literary figures, they possessed different areas of expertise within the literary domain. To understand whether they can both be classified as poets, we must first delve into their unique backgrounds and literary contributions. Natalia Ginzburg (1916-1991) was an Italian author, whose works spanned across various genres, including novels, essays, and short stories. Born in Palermo, Italy, she began her writing career in her early twenties, contributing short stories to journals and publications. However, the majority of her work revolves around fiction and non-fiction prose, rather than poetry. Ginzburg is best known for her novels and essays, which offer an exceptional portrayal of Italian society and family dynamics across different periods, including World War II and the post-war era. Some of her most prominent works include \\"The Dry Heart\\" (1947), \\"Family Sayings\\" (1963), and \\"No Way\\" (1973). While Ginzburg's writing speaks volumes about human relationships and emotions, her focus has predominantly been on prose, as opposed to poetry. Hart Crane (1899-1932), on the other hand, was an American poet celebrated for his innovative style and the depth of his imagery. Born in Garrettsville, Ohio, Crane's writing journey began at a young age, with his first poem published when he was only 17 years old. Despite facing numerous personal challenges throughout his life, Crane remains an influential figure in modern American poetry. His work is characterized by strong symbolism, dense metaphors, and audacious wordplay. Crane's poetic achievements reached their pinnacle with his book-length poem, \\"The Bridge\\" (1930), a work that blends inspiration from European and American sources and forms a vivid vision of the United States. Additionally, his earlier collection of poems, titled \\"White Buildings\\" (1926), voices the hope and despair of a generation dealing with rapid social and technological changes. In conclusion, Natalia Ginzburg and Hart Crane were both highly acclaimed and deeply influential figures in the literary world. While Ginzburg masterfully crafted intriguing stories and essays around human relationships and Italian society, it was Crane who dedicated his talents to poetry, producing thought-provoking and innovative works. Therefore, we can assert that Hart Crane was unquestionably a poet, but Natalia Ginzburg, despite her many literary accomplishments, was not primarily a poet. Instead, she should be appreciated and remembered for her remarkable contributions to the realms of fiction and non-fiction prose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for healthy, sturdy trees and avoid trees that are young and thin. Try to find 2 trees that are spaced apart the same distance as the length of your hammock.","completion":"After finding two sturdy and well-spaced trees, the next logical step in putting up a hammock is to attach suspension straps or ropes to the trees and secure the hammock to these attachments. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. Choose appropriate suspension straps or ropes: Select a suspension system that suits your needs. There are various types available, including tree-friendly straps, polyester ropes, and nylon webbing. Tree-friendly straps are highly recommended since they are not only strong but also protect the trees from being damaged. 2. Determine the right height: Before hanging your hammock, consider the desired height from the ground. Generally, the suspension straps should be placed about four to six feet above the ground, but it might vary based on your comfort preference, type of hammock, and individual requirements. 3. Attach suspension straps to the trees: Take one end of the suspension strap or rope and wrap it around the first tree at the determined height. Make sure it's tight and secure. You can either tie a strong knot, like a bowline knot or a figure-eight knot, or use a carabiner if your straps have built-in loops. Repeat this process for the second tree as well. 4. Measure sag: A good hammock hanging angle is crucial for comfort and stability. Aim for a 30-degree angle between the suspension system and the ground. To achieve this, imagine extending the strap towards the ground to create an equilateral triangle. Adjust the straps accordingly to achieve the desired sag. 5. Attach your hammock: Now, take your hammock and attach it to the suspension straps on both ends. You can use carabiners or S-hooks, depending on your hammock's design and suspension system. Ensure the connections are secure and that your hammock is hanging evenly on both sides. 6. Test the stability: Gently apply pressure to the hammock to test its stability and ensure it is secure. If the suspension is loose or the hammock hangs too low, adjust the straps as needed. You want the hammock to hold your weight without touching the ground or feeling unstable. 7. Fine-tune your hanging: Once you've confirmed your hammock's stability, you can fine-tune your setup. Adjust the tension and height as necessary to achieve a comfortable position that suits your preference. Make sure there's enough tension for support, while still allowing for a comfortable amount of sag. 8. Double-check your knots and connections: Before finally relaxing in your hammock, give the knots and connections one last check to make sure everything is safe and secure. Following these steps will allow you to comfortably and safely set up your hammock in the perfect location you've found between the two sturdy trees.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s? Despite the steep decline in Watts's popularity, Hope continued to hold a place in popular culture, and there remained those who considered it a major work. When the Tate Gallery held an exhibition of its Watts holdings in 1954, trade unionist and left-wing M.P. Percy Collick urged \\"Labour stalwarts\\" to attend the exhibition, supposedly privately recounting that he had recently met a Viennese Jewish woman who during \\"the terrors of the Nazi War\\" had drawn \\"renewed faith and hope\\" from her photographic copy. Meanwhile, an influential 1959 sermon by Martin Luther King Jr., now known as Shattered Dreams, took Hope as a symbol of frustrated ambition and the knowledge that few people live to see their wishes fulfilled, arguing that \\"shattered dreams are a hallmark of our mortal life\\", and against retreating into either apathetic cynicism, a fatalistic belief in God's will or escapist fantasy in response to failure.Myths continued to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the fact that in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim for which there is no evidence.In 1990 Barack Obama, at the time a student at Harvard Law School, attended a sermon at the Trinity United Church of Christ preached by Jeremiah Wright. Taking the Books of Samuel as a starting point, Wright explained that he had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s (Sampson described it as \\"a study in contradictions\\"), before discussing the image's significance in the modern world. The answer is:","completion":"Jeremiah Wright. The task involves carefully reading through the paragraph and extracting the answer for a specific question.

Why does the government issue 1RS note and not RBI? OPT: * no; * yes;","completion":"Yes, these two questions essentially have the same meaning as they both address the same topic regarding the unique situation where the one-rupee note in India is issued by the Government of India, while other denominations are issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Let's explore this matter in greater detail. In India, the issuance of currency notes is governed by the Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934 and the Indian Coinage Act of 2011. According to the RBI Act, the central bank is responsible for the issue and management of currency in the country, and this authority extends to the design, issuance, and withdrawal of most of the currency notes. However, the one-rupee note is an exception to this general rule, as it falls under the ambit of the Indian Coinage Act, which regulates the issuance of coins and one-rupee notes by the Government of India. This unique distinction can be attributed to historical reasons and the legislative framework that governs currency management in the country. The difference in responsibility can be traced back to British India's currency management system, which the RBI Act largely inherited. Under the British system, the issuing of notes higher than one rupee was the responsibility of the Controller of the Currency, but the issuance of coins and one-rupee notes was the responsibility of the Government of India, under the Indian Coinage Act. This distinction continued even after India became an independent nation and established the RBI. There are a few practical differences between one-rupee notes and other denominations as a result of this arrangement: 1. Signature: One-rupee notes bear the signature of the Finance Secretary of India, while other denomination notes carry the signature of the Governor of the RBI. 2. Design and language panel: One-rupee notes have a slightly different design pattern, with the Government of India monogram placed prominently, and the denomination mentioned in 15 languages in the language panel, while other denominations display the RBI's emblem and mention the denomination in 17 languages. 3. Legal tender status: Both one-rupee notes and other currency notes have the same legal tender status, meaning that they are universally accepted for payment within the country. In conclusion, the two questions inquired about the division of responsibility between the Government of India and the RBI in issuing the one-rupee note and other denominations of currency. The reasons behind this division can be attributed to the historical context and the legal framework that governs currency management in India. Although these questions are distinct in their phrasing, they essentially convey the same intent and concern, hence invoking a \\"yes\\" in terms of having the same meaning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Personally Nike is my favorite one--it's so simple. And I liked the stories behind them, which made me forget all other things. McDonald's, Apple, Mercedes Benz and Adidas own great logos as well, and they are among my favorites. Nike In the Greek myth, Nike is the goddess of victory and the source of inspiration for soldiers. This logo represents the wing in the famous statue of the Greek goddess. Nike's logo was designed by Carolyn Davidson in 1971 for 35, and was registered as a trademark in 1995. McDonald's The logo was designed in 1962 by Jim Schindler to resemble the archshaped signs on the side of the company's then walk-up hamburger stand. Later on, the two golden arches were combined together to form the M. The McDonald's name was added to the logo in 1968. Apple There are different stories behind Apple's logo. The first logo was a reference to the religious story of Adam and Eve, in which the apple represented the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. One year later, the second logo was designed in 1977 by Steven Jobs and Ronald Wayne, and it described Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. This logo didn't stay long. One year later it was replaced almost immediately by graphic designer Rob Janoff's \\" rainbow apple\\", a rainbow- colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. And then the rainbow- colored apple was replaced by the one- colored logo in 1998. It has not been changed so far. Mercedes Benz The Mercedes Benz logo, which was originally created by Gottlieb Daimler in 1909, consists of a simple description of a three- pointed star that represents its rule of the land, the sea and the air. The company was founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach. Marcedes is the name of Maybach's elder daughter, while Benz came as a result of a combination with Benz, Cie.and DMG in 1926.

Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack.

However, if you want to pair your sweater with a dress, skirt, shorts, and any other shorter garments worn on your bottom half, you probably want a slouchy sweater that still ends around the waist. If you’re going to be wearing an oversized sweater as a dress, you definitely want something long that covers you! Oversized sweaters go in and out of fashion, but when they are very stylish, in both men's and women's departments -don't be afraid to explore both sections – oversized sweaters are a fantastic, gender neutral wardrobe pieces. Make sure you also know that a more baggy sweater will go with more tighter bottoms then if you were to wear a tight sweater then you would wear baggy bottoms. Monochrome sweaters, especially those in neutral colors, are great additions to your wardrobe because they can be paired with all sorts of other clothes and accessories. Patterned sweaters can be fun statement pieces, and you can effortlessly create an outfit just by pairing them with neutral trousers, leggings, shorts etc. There is a time and a place for both bold patterns and solid neutrals. Consider your collection of pants, jeans, skirts, leggings, dresses, and so on when deciding which kind of sweater to add to your collection. This will help you decide if you want a thick, chunky sweater, or a more lightweight sweater. If you’re looking for a sweater to wear over layers, you may want to get something a bit less chunky – otherwise, you’ll feel like you’re wearing a sumo suit. On the other side, you don’t want something so sheer that you’ll see the bottom layers right through it. Lightweight, oversized cardigans are great to throw on over warm weather outfits, and big chunky sweaters look great with winter outfits. It’s all about visualizing the outfits you want to create!

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Just seven years ago, the Jarvik-7 artificial heart was being cheered as the model of human creativeness. The sight of Barney Clark----alive and conscious after trading his diseased heart for a metal-and-plastic pump----convinced the press, the public and many doctors that the future had arrived. It hadn't. After monitoring production of the Jarvik-7, and reviewing its effects on the 150 or so patients (most of whom got the device as a temporary measure) the U.S. Food and Drug Administration concluded that the machine was doing more to endanger lives than to save them. Last week the agency cancelled its earlier approval, effectively banning the device. The recall may hurt Symbion Inc., maker of the Jarvik-7, but it won't end the request for an artificial heart. One problem with the banned mode is that the tubes connecting it to an external power source created a passage for infection. Inventors are now working on new devices that would be fully placed, along with a tiny power pack, in the patient's chest. The first sample products aren't expected for another 10 or 20 years. But some people are already worrying that they'll work---and that America's overextended health-care programs will lose a precious 2.5 billion to 5 billion a year providing _ for a ly few dying patients.

The FDA concluded that the Jarvik-7 endangered lives more than it saved them, leading to its ban; future developments raise concerns about the potential impact on the nation's health due to high costs leading to reduced funding for basic care.

Output:","completion":"چون هوا هنوز خیلی پر از آشغال بود. Explanation: Here is the breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Because\\" = \\"چون\\". This term indicates a reason or cause in Persian, similar to its usage in English. 2. \\"The air\\" = \\"هوا\\". It is the Persian equivalent of the English term \\"air\\". 3. \\"Was still\\" = \\"هنوز\\". The Persian word for \\"still\\" represents the continuation of a state or condition. 4. \\"Very\\" = \\"خیلی\\". This word is used to amplify the degree of an adjective or adverb in Persian, just like in English. 5. \\"Thick\\" = \\"پر\\". In this context, \\"thick\\" is metaphorically translated as \\"پر\\" in Persian, which literally means \\"full\\".

Understand the original statement: \\"If She could not be implicated otherwise I should have heard some hint of it.\\" This statement implies that if it were possible for her to be implicated, the speaker would have likely heard a hint or some information suggesting the implication. 2. Analyze the sentence structure and meaning: The sentence structure is a conditional statement. It asserts that the speaker would hear information (\\"some hint of it\\") if the condition (she could be implicated) were met. 3. Consider the negation of the statement: The negation of the original statement would be that \\"if she could be implicated, then I have not heard any hint of it.\\" However, this negation cannot be directly inferred from the original statement. 4. Apply logical reasoning: If the speaker says they have not heard any hint of her implication (if there was any), it means there is a lack of information related to her implication. Therefore, it is not valid to conclude that \\"I heard she has been implicated\\" as the speaker has not received any such evidence. In conclusion, we cannot deduce that \\"I heard that she has been implicated\\" from the given statement.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Angling is a method of fishing by means of an \\"angle\\" (fish hook). The hook is usually attached to a fishing line and the line is often attached to a fishing rod. Fishing rods are usually fitted with a fishing reel that functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. The hook itself can be dressed with lures or bait. A bite indicator such as a float, and a weight or sinker are sometimes used. - The common carp or European carp (\\"Cyprinus carpio\\") is a widespread freshwater fish of eutrophic waters in lakes and large rivers in Europe and Asia. The native wild populations are considered vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN, but the species has also been domesticated and introduced into environments worldwide, and is often considered a destructive invasive species, being included in the list of the world's 100 worst invasive species. It gives its name to the carp family Cyprinidae. - Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - A fishing reel is a cylindrical device attached to a fishing rod used in winding and stowing line. - An invasive species is a plant, fungus, or animal species that is not native to a specific location (an introduced species), and which has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health. - A fish hook or fishhook is a device for catching fish either by impaling them in the mouth or, more rarely, by snagging the body of the fish. Fish hooks have been employed for centuries by fishermen to catch fresh and saltwater fish. In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by \\"Forbes\\" as one of the top twenty tools in the history of man. Fish hooks are normally attached to some form of line or lure device which connects the caught fish to the fisherman. There is an enormous variety of fish hooks in the world of fishing. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the fish hook. Fish hooks are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing). History. The fish hook or similar device has been made by man for many thousands of years. Neolithic fish hooks have been recorded from Palestine about 7000 BC. In 2011, archaeologists in the Jerimalai cave in East Timor discovered what was then the world's oldest fish hook, a shell hook between 16,000 and 23,000 years old.However finds also made from sea snails some 23,000 years ago and predating the East Timor finds were reported from Okinawa. An early written reference to a fish hook is found with reference to the Leviathan in the Book of Job 41:1; \\"Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?\\" Fish hooks have been crafted from all sorts of materials including wood, animal and human bone, horn, shells, stone, bronze, iron up to present day materials. In many cases, hooks were created from multiple materials to leverage the strength and positive characteristics of each material. Norwegians as late as the 1950s still used juniper wood to craft Burbot hooks. Quality steel hooks began to make... - A fishing line is a cord used or made for angling. Important parameters of a fishing line are its length, material, and weight (thicker lines are more visible to fish). Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include breaking strength, knot strength, UV resistance, castability, limpness, stretch, abrasion resistance, and visibility. Most modern lines are made from nylon or silk. - The Cyprinidae are the family of freshwater fishes, collectively called cyprinids, that includes the carps, the true minnows, and their relatives (for example, the barbs and barbels). Also commonly called the \\"carp family\\", or \\"minnow family\\", Cyprinidae is the largest known fish family and the largest vertebrate animal family in general, with about 3,000 living and extinct species in about 370 genera. The family belongs to the ostariophysian order Cypriniformes, of whose genera and species the cyprinids make more than two-thirds. The family name is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"kyprînos\\" (, \\"carp\\"). - A fishing rod is a long, flexible rod used to catch fish. At its simplest, a fishing rod is a simple stick or pole attached to a line ending in a hook (formerly known as an \\"angle\\", hence the term angling). The length of the rod can vary between . To entice fish, bait or lures are impaled on one or more hooks attached to the line. The line is generally stored on a reel which reduces tangles and assists in landing a fish. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Carp are various species of oily freshwater fish from the family Cyprinidae, a very large group of fish native to Europe and Asia. - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Angler's Mail is a weekly angling magazine published in London, UK, by IPC Media's Inspire division. - Benson ( 1984 -- 4 August 2009 ) was \`\` Britain 's biggest and best - loved '' common carp . Benson 's popularity was such that she was caught 63 times in 13 years , although the accessibility that made her popular was also the cause of controversy among angling 's elite . She has also been referred to as \`\` the people 's fish '' and was voted by readers of Angler 's Mail as Britain 's Favourite Carp in 2005 . The fish , who was female , was originally one of a pair : her original companion , Hedges , disappeared in a flood of the River Nene in 1998 . Both fish were named due to a hole in Benson 's dorsal fin that resembled a cigarette burn , in a reference to Benson and Hedges . At her peak weight , in 2006 , she weighed 64 pounds and 2 ounces ( 29 kg ) . Benson died on 4 August 2009 , aged 25 . At the time of her death , she weighed the same as a large dog and was worth £ 20,000 . The owner of the lake where she lived alleged that she was accidentally poisoned by anglers using uncooked tigernuts as bait , though evidence points to the contrary ( see section on death below ) .

While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll.

The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W.

With which song did Clodagh Rogers represent the UK in the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest?","completion":"Clodagh Rodgers represented the United Kingdom in the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Jack in the Box.\\" The contest took place in Dublin, Ireland, on April 3, 1971, and it was the 16th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest. The song was penned by renowned British songwriters John Worsley and David Myers. \\"Jack in the Box\\" is an upbeat, cheerful, and catchy pop song that stood out for its catchy melody and Clodagh's dynamic stage presence. Clodagh Rodgers, born on March 5, 1947, is a Northern Irish singer who gained significant popularity during the late 1960s and 1970s. Her charming personality, as well as her ability to engage the audience, contributed greatly to the success of her performance at the Eurovision contest. The 1971 Eurovision Song Contest featured 18 countries, and it was the second time the contest was hosted in Ireland. The event was held at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, which is known for its long-standing contribution to the Irish art scene. Clodagh Rodgers' \\"Jack in the Box\\" received 98 points, resulting in a respectable but not winning 4th place. The winner of that year's contest was Monaco with the song \\"Un Banc, Un Arbre, Une Rue,\\" performed by Séverine. Clodagh Rodgers' participation in Eurovision managed to boost her career in the United Kingdom. Following the contest, \\"Jack in the Box\\" was released as a single. The song achieved commercial success, peaking at number four on the UK Singles Chart. Furthermore, her rendition in Eurovision gained her wider recognition, and she became a favorite on British TV programs such as \\"Top of the Pops\\" and her own television series \\"It's Clodagh.\\" As a cultural event, the Eurovision Song Contest has been a platform for artists like Clodagh Rodgers to showcase their talents to a broader international audience. Additionally, for countries participating in the contest, Eurovision serves as a way of fostering relationships, as well as an opportunity to share their unique music identity with others. Although Clodagh Rodgers did not win the 1971 contest, her song \\"Jack in the Box\\" left a lasting impression on Eurovision history and opened new doors for her career in the UK."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... Question: After the study medical professionals probably recommended that Options: - not enough information - only the elderly take supplements - only pregnant women take supplements - only certain patients take supplements === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"only certain patients take supplements"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He also bought other fruit that he plans to eat fresh. He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. Which fruit have a higher sugar content candied ginger or fresh apples? Hint: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Answer:","completion":"Candied ginger has a higher sugar content compared to fresh apples. The process of making candied fruit involves immersing the fruit in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from the fruit and preserves it. The fruit becomes saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure it creates. Therefore, while fresh apples do contain natural sugars, the added sugar from the preservation process gives candied ginger a higher overall sugar content."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: The main international airport is Douala International Airport and a second international airport at the Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport. Sentence 2: The main international airport is the Douala International Airport and a secondary international airport at Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport. Step 2: Analyze the main points of each sentence. Both sentences mention: - The main international airport is Douala International Airport. - There is another international airport, Yaoundé Nsimalen International Airport. Step 3: Compare the structure and keywords used in the sentences. Both sentences utilize similar sentence structure. The main difference between the two is the use of \\"second\\" versus \\"secondary\\". Step 4: Evaluate the meaning of the different words used. - \\"Second\\" generally refers to the second item in a given order. - \\"Secondary\\" refers to something of lesser importance or a backup to the primary item. Step 5: Determine if the sentences convey the same meaning. While both sentences are conveying very similar information, the slight difference in the use of \\"second\\" and \\"secondary\\" could lead to a minor difference in interpretation. \\"Second\\" implies it is simply the next one on a list, while \\"secondary\\" may imply it is of lesser importance compared to the main airport.

While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

She's well-respected in her community and has raised her teenage son, Ethan, as a single mother. As Ethan is approaching his college years, he starts questioning his family roots and the absence of his father, a topic Sara has carefully avoided throughout his upbringing. One day, while exploring the attic in search of fabric for Sara's next big masterpiece, Ethan stumbles upon an old suitcase filled with hundreds of unsent postcards addressed to his father, Nathan, and pieces of clothing that seem to belong to a mysterious stranger. As Ethan reads through the postcards, cryptic messages from the woman named Lily strongly hint that he has a half-sibling somewhere in the world. Unable to hide his curiosity, Ethan confronts Sara about these discoveries, and reluctantly, she admits to having had a brief affair with a traveling artist, Liam, while she was married to Nathan. In a tearful confession, Sara reveals that she left Liam after learning she was pregnant, and never told him about the child. Nathan, who died in a car accident several years ago, had agreed to hide the truth and raise Ethan as his own. Feeling betrayed and confused, Ethan sets off on a journey to find his biological father, Liam, and potentially uncover the truth about his half-sibling. Although Sara wishes to accompany him, Ethan insists he must embark on this journey alone.

This option makes the most sense given the information provided. The text states that he lives in a farmhouse that is well away from anyone else and that the farm shut down long ago. This suggests that his area would not be described as a farming community because no active farming is taking place. It wouldn't be described as a cow's shed because he lives in a farmhouse, not a shed for animals. Michigan cannot be assumed as there's no specific location information provided in the description. Lastly, the option of 'housing farmer and family' doesn't fit either, as we are told that John doesn't farm himself.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are the base or the top ): Rich was examining a cliff face. Which part of the cliff is older, geologically speaking the base or the top? A:","completion":"The base of the cliff would be older, geologically speaking. This concept is based on the law of superposition, a major principle in geology that was first proposed by the Danish geological pioneer Nicholas Steno (1638–1686). The law states that in any undisturbed sequence of rocks deposited in layers (strata), the youngest layer is on top and the oldest on the bottom, each layer being younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. The reasoning behind this principle is simple and straightforward. When sedimentary rocks are formed, new sediments are deposited on top of older layers. These sediments can come from various sources such as rivers, volcanoes, or wind-blown dust. Over time, these sediments can get buried and compacted under the weight of newer sediments, eventually transforming into sedimentary rock layers. Therefore, starting from the base of a sedimentary sequence and moving upward, the materials become younger. When Rich examines a cliff face, the lowermost part of the cliff (the base) represents the earliest geological period, while the uppermost part of the cliff (the top) represents the latest or youngest geological period. This method of reading rock layers is also utilized in relative dating. It helps scientists determine the sequence of geologic events in a particular area, even if they can't determine the absolute ages of the rocks. So in summary, according to the law of superposition, the base of the cliff that Rich is examining would be older, geologically speaking, compared to the top. This is because over millions of years, newer sediment layers were deposited on top of older ones. So, the deeper you go into the ground or towards the base of a cliff or sequence, the further back in time you travel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A:","completion":"Based on the content of the review, it seems like the overall tone of the product review is mixed rather than strictly negative. Let's break down the different elements of the review to understand this conclusion more thoroughly: 1. The title of the review, \\"cool toy,\\" gives a positive impression, suggesting that the reviewer found the toy to be interesting and enjoyable. 2. In the body of the review, the author mentions that their child likes the seat and loves the accompanying toy. This statement indicates that the child is enjoying the product and, by extension, the parent is happy or satisfied with the product's ability to meet their child's needs to some extent. 3. The review then proceeds to mention a negative aspect, describing how the child, who is very small, tends to fall over to one side when seated. This suggests that the product might not be perfectly suited for all children, particularly those of smaller stature. This issue has the potential to diminish the overall satisfaction with the product. Although there is a negative point mentioned in the review, the overall sentiment seems to be mixed as it includes both positive and negative aspects. The parent is happy with the fact that their child is enjoying the seat and the accompanying toy, but they also express concern regarding the product's fit and safety for their child.

According to the results of a research study conducted a short while ago, a majority of Turkish people respect the separation of religion and state affairs. Nonetheless, a significant 76% of the respondents expressed their desire for headscarves, or turbans, to be permitted in university settings. This finding indicates that, while the Turkish population values the notion of distinct state and religious institutions, they also wish to secure individual freedom of expression when it comes to religious practices. In this case, the majority of Turks advocate for the right of women to wear headscarves as a part of their cultural and religious identity while attending higher education institutions. Headscarves represent an important aspect of Turkish culture and religion, particularly in the context of women's attire. Consequently, this display of support for allowing them in universities signals an inclination among the Turkish people toward inclusivity and acknowledgment of religious and cultural practices in public life. Furthermore, this majority viewpoint may demonstrate a balancing act between maintaining the essential separation of church and state while, at the same time, allowing for personal expressions of faith. This balance reflects a nuanced understanding of the coexistence of secular and religious elements in a diverse and democratic society. In summary, the research study reveals that while most Turks respect the division between religious and state matters, a significant proportion of them hope to accommodate the right to wear headscarves in universities.

Despite Benjamin's begging and pleading, Neil remained firm in his decision. A rabbit, after all, required much care and attention; it wasn't a mere toy one could play with and then cast aside. Benjamin, however, was not one to give up so easily. He spent days researching about rabbit care, watching videos and reading up on articles to prove that he could, in fact, properly care for a pet rabbit. He approached Neil again armed with his newfound knowledge, confidently explaining all he had learned about rabbits to demonstrate his seriousness and commitment to the challenge. Neil was impressed with Benjamin's dedication but still had his reservations. To further convince his father, Benjamin decided to develop a detailed plan of how he would take care of the bunny. He listed down all the daily tasks such as feeding, cleaning the hutch, providing exercise, and grooming the rabbit. Additionally, he provided an estimated budget for everything associated with rabbit care, including the cost of purchasing the rabbit, the hutch, bedding, hay, food, toys, and veterinary expenses. Eventually, Neil agreed to give Benjamin a chance to prove his responsibility. But instead of buying him a rabbit outright, they decided to volunteer at a local animal shelter that housed rabbits. This would allow Benjamin to gain hands-on experience in rabbit care and provide Neil with reassurance that his son could handle the responsibility. For several weeks, Benjamin and Neil visited the animal shelter, devoting quality time to understanding the needs and concerns of the rabbits there. Benjamin learned how to feed the rabbits, clean their cages, groom their fur, and even handle basic health issues that might arise. Neil watched as his son developed a strong bond with the rabbits, understanding their behaviors, and genuinely caring for their well-being. During this time, Benjamin formed a connection with one rabbit in particular, a brown and white bunny named Sophie. He found that Sophie was playful and affectionate, traits that made him fall in love with her instantly. Benjamin knew that Sophie was the perfect rabbit companion he had been hoping for. Having seen the passion and dedication from his son, Neil finally felt confident in Benjamin's ability to care for a pet rabbit. He agreed that they could adopt Sophie, much to Benjamin's delight. They began to prepare their home, ensuring that Sophie would have a safe and comfortable environment full of love and care when she came to live with them. As the day of Sophie's adoption neared, Benjamin couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. He had successfully educated himself about rabbit care and proven his responsibility and dedication to his father. He understood that pet ownership was no easy task, and he was grateful for the chance to prove his worth. In the end, Neil was happy with the outcome of the story, not only because his son had learned about the importance of responsibility and commitment but also because they had both discovered a new love for rabbits – an unexpected but heartwarming addition to their family. As they welcomed Sophie home, both Benjamin and Neil knew that she would bring endless joy and happiness into their lives, making all their efforts worthwhile. Benjamin cared for Sophie diligently, lovingly fulfilling his promise to be a responsible pet owner. And in the process, Neil and Benjamin's bond only grew stronger. Their shared love for and commitment to Sophie created a newfound bond between father and son, one that would last for years to come as they continued to learn and grow together, forever changed by the delightful rabbit that had hopped her way into their hearts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is trying see how temperature effects its deviations from ideality. He slowly increases the temperature of the oxygen and continues to measures its deviations. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will increasing the pressure cause the expected volume be more or less? Hint: The Figure below shows a graph of plotted against pressure for 1 mol of a gas at three different temperatures - 200 K, 500 K, and 1000 K. An ideal gas would have a value of 1 for that ratio at all temperatures and pressures and the graph would simply be a horizontal line. As can be seen, deviations from an ideal gas occur. As the pressure begins to rise, the attractive forces cause the volume of the gas to be less than expected and the value of drops under 1. Continued pressure increase results in the volume of the particles to become significant and the value of rises to greater than 1. Notice, that the magnitude of the deviations from ideality is greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K. Answer:","completion":"As Marcus increases the temperature of the oxygen in the sealed container, its deviations from ideality will be affected. According to the given information in the paragraph and the figure, we can understand how the gas will behave under different temperatures and pressures. From the figure provided, we can see that the behavior of the gas changes as temperature affects its deviations from ideality. At lower temperatures (200 K), the attractive forces between the gas molecules play a more significant role, causing the volume of the gas to be less than expected, and hence the value of drops under 1. At higher temperatures (1000 K), these attractive forces are less significant, and the deviations from ideality are minimal. The graph shows that the deviations from ideality decrease as the temperature increases. Now, considering the effect of pressure on the expected volume of the gas, we can infer the following: When Marcus increases the pressure on the sealed container of oxygen, the attractive forces between the gas molecules will initially cause the expected volume to be less than that predicted for an ideal gas. The gas will deviate more from ideality and display a value of less than 1. However, as the pressure continues to increase, the volume occupied by the gas particles themselves will become significant, causing the expected volume to be more than predicted for an ideal gas, and the value of will rise to greater than 1. Since Marcus is gradually increasing the temperature of the oxygen, the deviations from ideality will decrease. This means that the gas will behave more like an ideal gas, and its response to increasing pressure will be less influenced by the attractive forces between the molecules and the volume occupied by the particles themselves. In conclusion, as Marcus increases the temperature of the sealed container of oxygen while also increasing pressure, the expected volume will initially be less. However, at higher temperatures and continued pressure increase, the effect on the expected volume will be minimal, causing it to approach the values of an ideal gas. The magnitude of the deviations from ideality will be greatest for the gas at 200 K and least for the gas at 1000 K."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step in the process of the greenhouse effect, which leads to the warming of the Earth, involves the emission of greenhouse gases from various sources. These sources can be both natural and human-induced. Natural sources include volcanic activity, decomposition of organic matter, and the respiration of living organisms. Human-induced sources mainly consist of burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. When the sun's light reaches the Earth, it is either absorbed or reflected back into space. The absorbed sunlight heats up the Earth's surface, which then radiates heat energy in the form of infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, present in the Earth's atmosphere, trap some of this radiated heat and prevent it from escaping back into space, thus keeping the Earth warm. This trapped heat creates a natural \\"greenhouse effect,\\" which is essential for maintaining the Earth's temperature and supporting life. However, increasing levels of greenhouse gases due to human activities have enhanced the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change.

The hypothesis suggests that the war criminal got a fancy jail cell. It describes a potentially better or more privileged condition for the war criminal. Step 2: Evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis. To evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must analyze if the hypothesis can be true under the conditions given in the premise. The premise provides information about the relative treatment between the war criminal and his friends, but there is no specific mention of the conditions or treatment the friends receive. Thus, it is impossible to determine if the hypothesis is true based solely on the information provided in the premise. We need more information about the treatment or conditions his friends receive. In this case, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. The hypothesis might be true in some cases where the war criminal's friends also receive a fancy or privileged treatment. However, in other cases where his friends receive worse treatment or conditions, the hypothesis would not hold true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Prince of Foxes Movie plot: In August 1500, Andrea Orsini (Tyrone Power), an artistic minor nobleman who is equally skilled with the brush, the sword, words, and women, serves the Machiavellian Prince Cesare Borgia (Orson Welles) as a soldier. Pleased with Andrea's ability to \\"follow my mind and keep his eyes fixed on the ultimate goal,\\" Borgia selects Andrea to accomplish an intrigue: arrange the marriage of his widowed sister, Lucrezia (whose husband he has just had assassinated for the purpose), to Alfonso d'Este, the son of the Duke Ercole d'Este of Ferrara. By doing so, Borgia will remove Ferrara as an impediment to conquest of central Italy. In being selected, however, Andrea earns the enmity of Don Esteban Ramirez (Leslie Bradley), an ambitious mercenary captain and rival. Andrea travels to Venice to sell some of his paintings to raise money for expenses. He meets the lovely Camilla di la Baglione (Wanda Hendrix), young wife of the elderly Count Marc Antonio Verano of Citta del Monte, and smitten with her, gallantly gives her a painting he was haggling to sell for a hundred ducats. Soon after, an assassin attempts to kill Andrea, but he thwarts the attack and spares the assassin to learn who hired him: the Duke Ercole d'Este. He hires the assassin, Mario Belli (Everett Sloane), as part of his own entourage. Resuming the mission, Andrea stops to visit the farm of a blacksmith's widow, reputed to be hiding gold stolen by her bandit son. She is actually his mother (Katina Paxinou), and he is in fact Andrea Zoppo, not the noble Orsini he pretends to be. The reunion is a rocky one, because the mother does not approve of her son's evil ways. Belli spies on them through a window. Andrea continues to Ferrara, where he succeeds in arranging the marriage by intimidating the duke and flattering Alfonso.

Available choices: + yes. + it is not possible to tell. + no.","completion":"The answer to whether the hypothesis \\"I'm not a swimmer, I am black, so alright.\\" is true or not based on the given premise \\"i said okay because i'm not a swimmer\\" is: It is not possible to tell. To begin with, the premise provides information about an individual's swimming skills. It clearly establishes that the person in question is not a swimmer. This means that any hypothesis that suggests this person is not a swimmer aligns with the given premise. However, the second part of the hypothesis introduces a new piece of information about the individual, i.e., \\"I am black.\\" The premise does not mention the individual's race, skin color or ethnicity. The only characteristics the premise gives about this person pertains to their swimming abilities. Therefore, this part of the hypothesis does not align with the premise because they do not address the same aspects of this individual's identity or abilities. In light of this discrepancy, it is impossible to ascertain the veracity of this part of the hypothesis based on the given premise alone. The third part of the hypothesis, \\"so alright\\" is a statement of agreement or acceptance by the individual. This is similar to the premise where the individual affirmed, \\"I said okay\\". However, without additional context, it is unclear what this confirmation is related to. When we look at the hypothesis as a whole, it introduces a new piece of information that is not addressed in the premise, so it is impossible to ascertain the truth of the hypothesis in its entirety based solely on the provided premise.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Unpredictable\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in this context because it relates to the concerns James may have about the outcome of giving the AI a non-secular upbringing. Step 1: Analyze the given question. In the question, James has a preference for a secular upbringing for the AI. This indicates that he has concerns about the potential consequences of a non-secular upbringing. Step 2: Assess the possible answers in relation to the question. Going through the options, the other choices - eternal, religious, holy, and monastic - mostly relate to religious or spiritual aspects, which can be associated with a non-secular upbringing.

If you have a neutral skin tone, any shade will probably look good. For warm tones, dark browns, warm browns, chestnuts, rich golden browns, auburn, warm gold and red highlights, and golden blonde shades will look best on you. Go for colors with a red orange or gold base; those will look good on you. Avoid blue, violet, and ash based hair colors which will wash out your skin color. For cool tones, try shiny raven-wing blacks, cool ash browns, or cool blondes in shades ranging from mink to platinum and icy white. Avoid gold, yellow, red, and bronze tones in hair color. These warm tones have a tendency to make you look washed-out. You also may be able to wear many exciting bold, unnatural hair colors like lipstick red, cherry red, blue, and burgundies. Do you have light, medium, or dark skin? This is important when determining what color hair is right for you. With paler skin, lighter shades work. For light skin and warm tones, try butterscotch, strawberry blonde, or honey. For light skin and cool tones, try platinum, flaxen, or champagne blonde. Medium skin provides more versatility. Medium skin and warm tones can go tawny blonde, golden caramel, or copper. Cool tones with medium skin should try ashy tones, such as sand, wheat blonde, and walnut brown. Olive skin looks great with rich browns or earthy shades. Cool tones should try auburn or cinnamon, while warm tones can go with ebony brown and mocha. For dark skin and cool tones, go for espresso and inky black. For dark skin and warm tones, try maple brown, mahogany, or toffee. Eye color can determine whether a hair color looks good on your or not. Do you want your eyes to pop? Green and blue eyes might look great with reds, brown, or blonde, while dark eyes might look great with a contrasting color. The extent to which you want to change your hair color impacts your choices. Do you want to keep your hair looking natural? Or do you want to go completely opposite? Do you want to get a bold, unnatural color? Decide what is best for you and your life. If you want to go natural, only go 2-3 shades lighter or darker than your natural hair color. Choose a color that will look good on you. Maybe you've always liked red hair, but is it right for you? If you love blue but have warm toned skin, consider another drastic, bold color. If you are unsure about a color, try temporary dyes. Permanent and semi-permanent dyes are more long-lasting if you want color that will stick around for awhile. Permanent hair color won't wash out and will allow you to go lighter. Going lighter will probably require bleach. It's harder to reverse permanent dye, and you will have to retouch the roots as your hair grows. Semi-permanent hair color fades away with washes. It's great for highlighting, changing color tones in hair, adding depth, and covering grey. It cannot lighten the hair significantly. Temporary hair color washes out within 25-30 washes. It's good for adding shiny, vibrant colors to hair in a darker or brighter color. It also allows you to change your hair tone. They can't lighten your hair. Before you get a drastic makeover, decide why you are doing this. Are you following a trend? Have you recently had a traumatic experience, like a death in the family or a break up? Making drastic style choices based on emotions is not the best way to choose a style. Many websites will allow you to put different hairstyles onto a picture to see which you look best with. Others allow you to input your hair and style preferences to determine the right color for you. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article would be: To choose the best hair color for you, first determine your skin tone (neutral, warm, or cool) and skin shade (light, medium, or dark). Warm tones suit colors with red, orange, or gold bases, while cool tones work best with cool, ash-based shades. Lighter shades usually work well with pale skin, medium shades for medium skin, and darker or richer tones for dark and olive skin. Consider your eye color and whether you want a natural or bold look. Experiment with temporary dyes if unsure, and choose between permanent or semi-permanent options based on your desired level of commitment. Avoid making drastic style decisions based on emotions and consider using online tools to virtually test different hairstyles and colors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Morissette was born June 1, 1974, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to teacher Georgia Mary Ann (nee Feuerstein) and high-school principal and French teacher Alan Richard Morissette. She has two siblings: older brother Chad is a business entrepreneur, and twin brother (12 minutes older) Wade is a musician. Her father is of French and Irish descent and her mother has Hungarian ancestry. On November 20, 2011, Morissette appeared at the American Music Awards. When asked about the new album during a short interview, she said she had recorded thirty-one songs, and that the album would \\"likely be out next year, probably [in] summertime\\". On December 21, 2011, Morissette performed a duet of \\"Uninvited\\" with finalist Josh Krajcik during the performance finale of the X-Factor. Morissette embarked on a European tour for the summer of 2012, according to Alanis.com. In early May 2012, a new song called \\"Magical Child\\" appeared on a Starbucks compilation called Every Mother Counts. On May 2, 2012, Morissette revealed through her Facebook account that her eighth studio album, entitled Havoc and Bright Lights, would be released in August 2012, on new label \\"Collective Sounds\\", distributed by Sony's RED Distribution. On the same day, Billboard specified the date as August 28 and revealed the album would contain twelve tracks. The album's lead single, \\"Guardian\\", was released on iTunes on May 15, 2012, and hit the radio airwaves four days prior to this. The single had minor success in North America, charting the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles in the US and almost reaching the top 40 in Canada. However, the song did become a hit in several countries in Europe. \\"Receive\\", the second single off the album, was released early December the same year. Morissette received the UCLA Spring Sing's George and Ira Gershwin Award on May 16, 2014 at Pauley Pavilion. On her website starting in the summer of 2014, in celebration of her fortieth birthday, the LP record for her song \\"Big Sur\\" was offered for sale, which was previously available on the Target edition of her 2012 album, Havoc and Bright Lights.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who replaces the movie's lead female villain? , can you please find it? The My Scene girls are attending high school in Manhattan when they find out there's a new teen spy movie called \\"Spy Society\\" being filmed there, starring Lindsay Lohan (who plays Mariel St. Clair, the lead character) and fictional character Ryan Ridley (who plays Lohan's love interest in the movie). While the girls, Barbie, Chelsea, Madison, Nolee, and Delancey, go to watch it being filmed, they get the idea to sneak into the film by pretending to be extras. While working as extras for the movie, the girls quickly learn that there's actually a lot of work that goes into making a movie, such as getting to the set really early in the morning, doing hours and hours of takes on a scene, and Chelsea keeps getting terrible roles such as towel girl, trash girl and even being forced to clean up after the horses that are being used in the movie. The girls imagine themselves becoming best friends with Lindsay Lohan, who turns out to be really nice and down-to-earth (and who they do end up becoming friends with). When one of the actresses on the set gets hurt and is unable to play her part, Madison's called in to take her place. The actress she's replacing plays the movie's lead female villain, although the character only has five speaking lines After a while, the fame starts going to Madison's head.

Background: Ai Carina Uemura (Zhi Cun Ai karina, Uemura Ai Karina, born November 2, 1981), known mononymously as Ai (Japanese pronunciation: [ai], stylized as AI or A.I. ) is a Japanese-American singer and songwriter who was born in Los Angeles. Ai spent her childhood in both Kagoshima, Japan and Los Angeles. She debuted as a singer in 2000, later moving to Def Jam Japan and rising to fame with her album 2004 Ai. Context: Ai was born in Los Angeles in 1981. Her father was Japanese and her mother was half Italian-American and half Japanese. She moved to Kagoshima in Japan when she was 4, and went to elementary school and junior high school in Japan. Ai was motivated to become a singer in her early teens, after singing at a cousin's wedding, having many people ask her if she wanted to be a professional singer, and hearing a gospel performance at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles in 1993. After graduating from junior high school in Japan, Ai returned to Los Angeles for high school, enrolling at Glendale High School, however found high school difficult due to never formally studying English. After making it through the audition process, she switched to the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, majoring in ballet. She became a member of the school's gospel choir. In 1998, she performed in a gospel choir at a Mary J. Blige concert at the Universal Amphitheatre, performing of \\"A Dream.\\" In the same year, she appeared as a dancer in the music video for Janet Jackson's song \\"Go Deep.\\" In 1999, she joined an Asian girl group called SX4, who were produced by George Brown of Kool & the Gang. Ai was a member of the group for two years, and later in 1999 the group were offered a record label deal. While on her summer holiday in Kagoshima, she performed Monica's \\"For You I Will\\" on a local radio station, which led to her being scouted by BMG Japan. She decided to take the offer, and after leaving SX4 and graduating from high school in June 2000, moved to Tokyo and debuted as a musician later in 2000. Question: where was he born?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - In biological anatomy , commonly referred to as the mouth , under formal names such as the oral cavity , buccal cavity , or in Latin cavum oris , is the opening through which many animals take in food and issue vocal sounds . It is also the cavity lying at the upper end of the alimentary canal , bounded on the outside by the lips and inside by the pharynx and containing in higher vertebrates the tongue and teeth . This cavity is also known as the buccal cavity , from the Latin bucca ( \`\` cheek '' ) . Some animal phyla , including vertebrates , have a complete digestive system , with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other . Which end forms first in ontogeny is a criterion used to classify animals into protostome and deuterostome . - Swallowing, sometimes called deglutition in scientific contexts, is the process in the human or animal body that makes something pass from the mouth, to the pharynx, and into the esophagus, while shutting the epiglottis. Swallowing is an important part of eating and drinking. If the process fails and the material (such as food, drink, or medicine) goes through the trachea, then choking or pulmonary aspiration can occur. In the human body the automatic temporary closing of the epiglottis is controlled by the swallowing reflex. - Cheeks constitute the area of the face below the eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear. \\"Buccal\\" means relating to the cheek. In humans, the region is innervated by the buccal nerve. The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums is called the vestibule or buccal pouch or buccal cavity and forms part of the mouth. In other animals the cheeks may also be referred to as jowls. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Taste, gustatory perception, or gustation is one of the five traditional senses that belongs to the gustatory system. - Saliva is a watery substance formed in the mouths of animals, secreted by the salivary glands. Human saliva comprises 99.5% mostly water, plus electrolytes, mucus, white blood cells, epithelial cells (which can be used to extract DNA), glycoproteins, enzymes (such as amylase and lipase), antimicrobial agents such as secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. These enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices, thus protecting teeth from bacterial decay. Furthermore, saliva serves a lubricative function, wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation. - The blood vessels are the part of the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word \\"vascular\\", meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin \\"vas\\", meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled. - The lungs are the primary organs of respiration in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their musculoskeletal systems to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the primary muscle that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible. - Mastication or chewing is the process by which food is crushed and ground by teeth. It is the first step of digestion, and it increases the surface area of foods to allow more efficient break down by enzymes. During the mastication process, the food is positioned by the cheek and tongue between the teeth for grinding. The muscles of mastication move the jaws to bring the teeth into intermittent contact, repeatedly occluding and opening. As chewing continues, the food is made softer and warmer, and the enzymes in saliva begin to break down carbohydrates in the food. After chewing, the food (now called a bolus) is swallowed. It enters the esophagus and via peristalsis continues on to the stomach, where the next step of digestion occurs. - The nasal cavity (or nasal fossa) is a large air filled space above and behind the nose in the middle of the face. Each cavity is the continuation of one of the two nostrils. - Taste buds contain the taste receptor cells, which are also known as gustatory cells. The taste receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, the cheek and epiglottis. These structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception: salty, sour, bitter, sweet and umami; through the combination of these elements we detect \\"flavors.\\" A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves. - The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three partsthe outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \\"ear\\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation. - The pharynx (plural: pharynges) is the part of the throat that is behind the mouth and nasal cavity and above the oesophagus and the larynx, or the tubes going down to the stomach and the lungs. The pharynx is an organ found in vertebrates and invertebrates, though the structure is not universally the same across all of those species. - A nerve is an enclosed, cable-like bundle of axons (nerve fibers, the long and slender projections of neurons) in the peripheral nervous system. A nerve provides a common pathway for the electrochemical nerve impulses that are transmitted along each of the axons to peripheral organs. - The buccal nerve (long buccal nerve) is a nerve in the face. It is a branch of the mandibular nerve (which is itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve) and transmits sensory information from skin over the buccal membrane (in general, the cheek) and from the second and third molar teeth. Not to be confused with the buccal branch of the facial nerve which transmits motor information to the buccinator muscle. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - The larynx (plural larynges; from the Greek \\"lárynx\\"), commonly called the voice box, is an organ in the neck of tetrapods involved in breathing, sound production, and protecting the trachea against food aspiration. It manipulates pitch and volume. The larynx houses the vocal cords, which are essential for phonation. They are situated just below where the tract of the pharynx splits into the trachea and the esophagus. - In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the anterior part of the neck, positioned in front of the vertebra. It contains the pharynx and larynx. An important section of it is the epiglottis, which is a flap separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe) preventing food and drink being inhaled into the lungs. The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords. Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle. The \\"throat\\" is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the isthmus of the fauces. - The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth of most vertebrates that manipulates food for mastication, and is used in the act of swallowing. It is of importance in the digestive system and is the primary organ of taste in the gustatory system. The tongue's upper surface (dorsum) is covered in taste buds housed in numerous lingual papillae. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning the teeth. A major function of the tongue is the enabling of speech in humans and vocalization in other animals. - Modern humans (\\"Homo sapiens\\", primarily ssp. \\"Homo sapiens sapiens\\") are the only extant members of Hominina tribe (or human tribe), a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; manual dexterity and increased tool use, compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies. - Speech is the vocalized form of communication based upon the syntactic combination of lexicals and names that are drawn from very large (usually about 1,000 different words) vocabularies. Each spoken word is created out of the phonetic combination of a limited set of vowel and consonant speech sound units (phonemes). These vocabularies, the syntax which structures them, and their sets of speech sound units differ, creating many thousands of different, and mutually unintelligible, human languages. Most human speakers are able to communicate in two or more of them, hence being polyglots. The vocal abilities that enable humans to produce speech also enable them to sing. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. - The face is a central organ of sense and is also very central in the expression of emotion among humans and among numerous other species. The face is normally found on the anterior (\\"frontal\\", \\"rostral\\") surface of the head of animals or humans, although not all animals have faces. The face is crucial for human identity, and damage such as scarring or developmental deformities have effects stretching beyond those of solely physical inconvenience. - The esophagus (American English) or oesophagus (British English) (/sfs/), commonly known as the food pipe or gullet, is an organ in vertebrates through which food passes, aided by peristaltic contractions, from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is a fibromuscular tube, about 25 centimetres long in adults, which travels behind the trachea and heart, passes through the diaphragm and empties into the uppermost region of the stomach. During swallowing, the epiglottis tilts backwards to prevent food from going down the larynx and lungs. The word \\"esophagus\\" is the Greek word for \\"gullet\\".

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve for m in the equation -192 = -125m + 93m, we first combine like terms on the right side of the equation. -125m and 93m are like terms because they both contain the variable m. So let's subtract 93m from -125m. -125m + 93m = -32m Now, we have -192 = -32m. Next, to isolate m, we divide both sides of the equation by -32, which is the coefficient of m. So, -192 / -32 = m Note that when we divide a negative number by another negative number, we get a positive number. So, m = 192 / 32 Which simplifies to m = 6. Thus, the solution to the equation -192 = -125m + 93m is m = 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur. The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.

Question: suppose a bird finds more twigs on the ground happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER nests. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"If a bird finds more twigs on the ground, it can potentially affect the size and number of nests that they build. To understand the impact on the type of nests - less or smaller nests - we need to consider a few factors such as the bird's nesting behavior, species, and habitat availability. Option A: More less or smaller nests One potential outcome is that the bird might build more less or smaller nests with the increased availability of twigs. This could happen in a few scenarios - 1. Territorial birds: Some bird species are territorial and may build multiple nests in their territory to prevent other birds from settling in. Having more twigs allows the bird to invest its time and energy in creating a larger number of smaller nests, which would enhance its territorial claims. 2. Mate attraction: Certain bird species construct multiple nests to attract a mate. In such cases, a larger number of twigs may encourage the bird to create more nests, even if they are less or smaller. 3. Nest failure and rebuilding: Birds, especially the ones that nest in regions with declining habitats or increased predation, may experience nest failures. Having more twigs readily available may lead them to quickly rebuild a new, less or smaller nest without too much effort. Option B: Less less or smaller nests Another possible outcome is that with more twigs on the ground, the bird might build fewer less or smaller nests. This could result from the following situations - 1. Energy conservation: As birds expend energy in nest-building, an abundance of twigs might enable them to build a more substantial and durable nest with less effort, reducing the need for additional nests or frequent rebuilding. 2. Protective measures: A well-built and sturdy nest is more difficult for predators to access or destroy. With more twigs available, birds can focus on creating a single, well-constructed nest that keeps their eggs and young safe, ultimately reducing the number of less or smaller nests. Option C: No effect It's also possible that the increased availability of twigs might have no effect on the nest size or number, as the bird's nesting behavior could be established by their inherent instincts and not significantly influenced by the twig supply. In conclusion, the availability of more twigs on the ground could lead to more, fewer, or have no effect on the number of less or smaller nests, depending on the bird species, nesting habits, and environmental factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Apply a hair mask at least once a month to provide deep conditioning and to encourage softness and shine. Use a hair mask that's specially designed for your hair type, whether your hair is dry, oily or colored. Good hair masks can be found in pharmacies and hair salons. Alternatively, you can make your own hair mask, using ingredients from your kitchen. For all hair types: avocado and honey: Cut and scoop out the flesh from a ripened avocado and mix in a tablespoon of organic honey. Apply to hair and allow it to sit for 20 minutes before rinsing it off in the shower. For dry hair: olive oil and egg: Combine three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil with two eggs and apply the mixture to your hair and let the mixture sit for 20 minutes before rinsing in the shower with cool water (so the egg doesn't cook!). If you do not like the smell of raw eggs, you can use a ready egg oil (eyova) instead. For oily hair: apple cider vinegar and lemon: Combine 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar with the grated peel of an entire lemon and allow it to set for 15 minutes to absorb the excess oil from your scalp, and then rinse in the shower. For flaky scalp: banana, honey and almond: Mash together 1/2 a ripe banana and add two tablespoons of honey and a few drops of almond oil and allow it to set with a shower cap on for 20 minutes before rinsing. Apply to serum to wet hair before drying, or to freshly blow-dried hair. It will help keep your hair soft and shiny, while minimizing frizz. Usually only a very small amount of serum is required (dime-sized amount). Apply serum to ends and mid lengths of hair, but avoid the roots, otherwise your hair will look greasy. It is crucial to apply some sort of heat protection product before subjecting your hair to high temperatures from irons and dryers. Heat is your hair's worst enemy, so use a heat-protection spray to lock in moisture and minimize burning and breakage. Heat protection products come in many forms, including sprays, serums, mousses and creams. Always apply heat protection to wet or damp hair to ensure it absorbs fully. If you apply to dry hair, it will sit on top of the hair and will not provide adequate heat protection. You know how important it is to protect your skin from harmful UV rays, but what about your hair? The sun can be drying and damaging to your hair, so it's important to use products that are specifically designed to minimize of sun damage. These products can help prevent highlighted hair from lightening too quickly and looking fried, and they can keep dark hair from turning brassy or red. Most UV shields are finishing products such as UV-based hairsprays or leave-in conditioners. Keep in mind that UV shielding products always need to be applied to damp hair. Otherwise, they'll sit on the surface and won't sink into the hair. Avoid shampoos, conditioners and other hair care products that contain harsh sulfates, parabens or sodium chlorine. These ingredients will build up in hair over time, causing damage and weighing down your locks.","completion":"Use a hair mask monthly for deep conditioning and improved hair health.

Oxygen makes up approximately 46.6% of the Earth's crust by weight. It is followed by silicon, which accounts for about 27.7%. These two elements combine to form silicates, which are the primary components of many rocks and minerals on Earth. Oxygen's abundance is attributed to various factors. One of the primary reasons is its high reactivity, which allows it to readily form compounds with other elements. Moreover, oxygen was formed in large quantities in the early Universe through the process of nuclear fusion in stars, which later dispersed oxygen and other elements into the interstellar medium. From there, these elements eventually became incorporated into the solar system and formed the planets, including Earth. The abundance of oxygen on Earth is further increased by the presence of water, which is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). When considering the Earth's crust, the composition varies depending on the specific location. In general, the crust is predominantly composed of igneous rocks, such as granite and basalt, as well as sedimentary rocks, like limestone and sandstone. All of these rocks are formed primarily from the combination of oxygen, silicon, and other elements like aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. Collectively, these elements form the bulk of the Earth's crust. A more detailed breakdown of the Earth's crust composition by weight includes: 1. Oxygen (O): 46.6% 2. Silicon (Si): 27.7% 3. Aluminum (Al): 8.1% 4. Iron (Fe): 5.0% 5. Calcium (Ca): 3.6% 6. Sodium (Na): 2.8% 7. Potassium (K): 2.6% 8. Magnesium (Mg): 2.1% 9. All other elements: 1.5% As evident from the percentages, oxygen's abundance in the Earth's crust is significant, making it the most abundant element. Its ability to bond with other elements to form stable compounds like silicates, oxides, and hydroxides further contributes to its prevalence and essential role in the geological makeup of the Earth's crust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition. - A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality. - Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature. - A memoir (from French: \\"mémoire\\": \\"memoria\\", meaning \\"memory\\" or \\"reminiscence\\") is a collection of memories that an individual writes about moments or events, both public or private, that took place in the subject's life. The assertions made in the work are understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story \\"of a life\\", while a memoir often tells \\"a story from a life\\", such as touchstone events and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a \\"memoirist\\" or a \\"memorialist\\". - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France.

Write a title for this article: Air Force One is protected by electronic jammers from most missiles, likely including the one that may have shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over the Russian-Ukrainian border Thursday. Why aren’t commercial airliners protected, too? This has been a debate ever since the development of small, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles like the U.S. Stinger nearly 35 years ago, and the resulting fears that such weapons could fall into the wrong hands. It may cost the airline industry billions of dollars, but Pentagon officials spoke of the need for such defenses in 2002, after a pair of Russian-made shoulder-launched Strela-2 missiles narrowly missed an Israeli 757 as it took off from the Kenyan city of Mombassa with 271 aboard. MH17 may have been downed by a bigger, radar-guided missile, in which case defenses against shoulder-fired heat-seeking missiles wouldn’t have worked. But defeating missiles is a problem the Pentagon has been grappling with for some time: In 1999, the Defense Department told Congress the biggest threat to its cargo planes was shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles like the ones fired in Mombassa. In 2002, the Pentagon awarded a 23 million contract to outfit four Air Force C-17 cargo planes with sophisticated equipment to protect them from Stingers, SA-7s and other portable heat-seeking missiles favored by terrorists. “That’s more than 5 million per plane,” an Air Force officer said at the time. “Once the first U.S. commercial airliner is shot down—and U.S. airlines rush to install these systems on their own planes—the price will drop to 2 million or 3 million per plane.” Not exactly a bargain, but some U.S. defense officials have long believed that such systems will have to become standard equipment aboard U.S. airliners. That 2002 system was an updated version of the AN/AAQ-24 (V) Nemesis, which protects both big transports (apparently including Air Force One) and military helicopters. Built by the Northrop Grumman Corp., it is known as the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures — LAIRCM — system, and plans were to outfit the hundreds of cargo planes and tankers operated by the U.S. Air Force. LAIRCM automatically detects, tracks and jams infrared missiles, sending a high-intensity laser beam into the missile’s seeker to disrupt its guidance system. No action is required by the crew. The pilot simply is informed that a threat missile was detected and jammed. “Inexpensive, yet lethal, surface-to-air missiles have proliferated around the globe and unfortunately are in the hands of our potential adversaries,” Arnold Welch, vice president for Infrared Countermeasures Programs at Northrop Grumman’s Defensive Systems Division in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, said at the time. “It is essential that our military pilots and air crews have this sophisticated type of protection in order to perform their missions and return safely.” Early reports from Ukraine suggest the plane may have been downed by a tracked Russian-built Buk missile system. Flying at about 33,000 feet, the airliner was beyond the range of most man-portable missiles. The Buk missile uses radar to guide itself to its target, unlike the heat-seeking Stinger. Planes trying to elude radar-guided missiles can use various electronic jammers and disperse clouds of foil-like chaff to confuse the missile’s radar by confusing it with multiple targets. The threat of SAM attacks on U.S. airliners was acknowledged in an FAA study in 1993, which noted that as passenger and baggage screening became more rigorous, the chances of missile strikes would rise. The U.S. government’s interest in the problem followed its decision to supply Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan—whose ranks included the late Osama bin Laden and many of his al-Qaeda lieutenants—with about 1,000 Stinger missiles in the 1980s. Pentagon officials credit the Stinger with downing about 250 Soviet aircraft. The discovery of a Strela-2 (dubbed the SA-7 by NATO) missile tube near a Saudi military base used by U.S. warplanes in 2001 prompted the FBI to alert U.S. law-enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for any signs that terrorists were planning shoulder-fired missile attacks. While the missile found in Saudi Arabia remained in its tube, burn marks suggested a bungled effort to fire it, U.S. officials said. A Sudanese with possible al Qaeda links was arrested in connection with the missile. “The FBI possesses no information indicating that al-Qaeda is planning to use ‘Stinger’ missiles or any type of MANPAD (MAN Portable Air Defense) weapons system against commercial aircraft in the United States,” the 2001 FBI warning said. “However, given al-Qaeda’s demonstrated objective to target the U.S. airline industry, its access to U.S. and Russian-made MANPAD systems, and recent apparent targeting of U.S.-led military forces in Saudi Arabia, law enforcement agencies in the United States should remain alert to potential use of MANPADs against U.S. aircraft.” Title:","completion":"\\"Why Don't Commercial Airplanes Have Missile Protection Like Air Force One?\\""},{"prompt":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a context passage, a question about that paragraph, and a possible answer to that question. The task is to check the validity of the answer. Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Input: The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP. He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert. He said the President signed off on that concept. The President said he remembered such a conversation, and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot. The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft. The Vice President's military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room, but he did not hear what they said. Rice, who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him, remembered hearing him inform the President, \\"Sir, the CAPs are up. Sir, they're going to want to know what to do.\\" Then she recalled hearing him say, \\"Yes sir.\\" She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes, perhaps five, after they entered the conference room. We believe this call would have taken place sometime before 10:10 to 10:15. Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning, there is no documentary evidence for this call, but the relevant sources are incomplete. Others nearby who were taking notes, such as the Vice President's chief of staff, Scooter Libby, who sat next to him, and Mrs. Cheney, did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft-presumably hijacked-heading toward Washington. That aircraft was United 93. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA. The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return. Thus, the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania. <sep>What was the name of the person who heard, \\"Yes Sir\\" while in the conference room?<sep>President Output:","completion":"In this task, you are given a context passage about a conversation between the Vice President and the President regarding the rules of engagement for the CAP.

The phrase \\"Фантастические звери и места их обитания\\" is the Russian title for the book and film \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\", a spin-off of the Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling. Let's delve into the series a little to get a better understanding of it. The franchise is set decades before the Harry Potter series, focusing on Newt Scamander, a Magizoologist, who studies magical creatures, also known as 'fantastic beasts', and their habitats. The first book, \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\", serves as a textbook mentioned in the Harry Potter series. Written by the acclaimed author J.K. Rowling under the pseudonym Newt Scamander, it covers the history of Magizoology and describes 85 magical species found around the wizarding world. Originally, the textbook was written for educational purposes, to be used by Hogwarts students, but later made available for muggles (humans without magical ability). On the other hand, the film series of the same name is an expansion of the wizarding world from the Harry Potter films. It introduced fans to a new era of the wizarding world set in the 1920s, decades before Harry Potter was born. The leading character, Newt Scamander, journeys to several continents observing, rescuing, and taking care of an array of magical creatures. The series also provides backstory about the rise of dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald, who was mentioned in the original Harry Potter series. Just as \\"Фантастические звери и места их обитания\\" translates to \\"Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them\\" in English, the phrase likely carries the same meaning and resonance for Russian fans, invoking the same sense of magical adventure and discovery. In the broader sense, it illustrates the profound influence of J.K. Rowling's wizarding world, transcending cultural and language barriers, creating a global community of fans all finding a common connection in the love for magic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale.

Would \\"LCDs are used in a wide range of applications including computer monitors , televisions , instrument panels , aircraft cockpit displays , and signage.\\" be a reasonable answer? +No. +Yes. Answer:","completion":"No, the provided statement does not explain how LCD monitors work. It only states various applications of LCDs. A more detailed answer would be: LCD monitors work by using Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology, which manipulates the polarization of light passing through it. Here's a simplified explanation of how LCD monitors function: 1. Backlight: The foundation of an LCD monitor is the backlight, typically made up of LEDs or CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp). It provides a consistent light source behind the screen. 2. Polarizing filters: A pair of polarizing filters are placed on either side of the system. They help in directing the lightwaves in a specific orientation. The first filter polarizes the light vertically, while the second filter, placed near the screen surface, is horizontally polarized. 3. Color filters and subpixels: The liquid crystal layer is made up of pixels, which are divided into three subpixels—red, green, and blue. Each subpixel has color filters, allowing only the corresponding color light to pass through. 4. Liquid crystals: In between the pair of polarizing filters is a layer containing liquid crystals. These crystals can change their orientation when an electrical voltage is applied to them. They impact the polarization of the incoming light, deciding whether it will pass through the second filter or not. 5. Electrodes and addressing: To manipulate each individual subpixel, a grid of thin film transistors (TFTs), acting as electrodes, is used. They control the voltage applied to the liquid crystals, and hence, determine their orientation. 6. Combining the elements: When voltage is applied, the liquid crystals adjust their orientation, effectively allowing light to pass through the second polarizing filter based on the extent of the twist. As different voltages are applied to the subpixels, the combination of different intensities of red, green, and blue light creates a vast palette of colors that make up the image on the screen. Essentially, LCD monitors control light from the backlight source by adjusting the twist of liquid crystal molecules and using polarizing filters, color filters, and electrodes to display images or text on the screen."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

We previously demonstrated that arachidonic acid levels are increased and docosahexaenoic acid levels are decreased in affected tissues from cystic fibrosis-knockout mice. In this study we determined whether humans with mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene have a similar fatty acid defect in tissues expressing CFTR. METHODS Fatty acids from nasal- and rectal-biopsy specimens, nasal epithelial scrapings, and plasma were analyzed from 38 subjects with cystic fibrosis and compared with results in 13 obligate heterozygotes, 24 healthy controls, 11 subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, 9 subjects with upper respiratory tract infection, and 16 subjects with asthma. RESULTS The ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic acid was increased in mucosal and submucosal nasal-biopsy specimens (P<0.001) and rectal-biopsy specimens (P=0.009) from subjects with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic sufficiency and subjects with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency, as compared with values in healthy control subjects. In nasal tissue, this change reflected an increase in arachidonic acid levels and a decrease in docosahexaenoic acid levels. In cells from nasal mucosa, the ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic acid was increased in subjects with cystic fibrosis (P<0.001), as compared with healthy controls, with values in obligate heterozygotes intermediate between these two groups (P<0.001). The ratio was not increased in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease. Subjects with asthma and those with upper respiratory tract infection had values intermediate between those in subjects with cystic fibrosis and those in healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that alterations in fatty acids similar to those in cystic fibrosis-knockout mice are present in CFTR-expressing tissue from subjects with cystic fibrosis..
