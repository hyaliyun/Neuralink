Please write a short summary for the following article: State pension board votes on Trotsky’s pay The board of the Massachusetts state pension fund voted Tuesday to give executive director Michael Trotsky a 65,000 raise, to 360,000 a year, which will make him one of the dozen highest-paid officials in the state, including his bonus. Trotsky has the potential to earn a 40 percent annual bonus, as he did this year, which could push his total pay to 504,000 in 2015. Salaries of the staff at Pension Reserves Investment Management, which oversees the 60.2 billion retirement fund for state and local workers, do not come out of the state budget. But the vote came amid a broader discussion in Massachusetts about pay for public servants. Outgoing Treasurer Steve Grossman was in the minority Tuesday as one of two “no” votes on Trotsky’s pay raise, while the seven other board members approved the increase. One of the representatives of Governor Deval Patrick also voted no, citing challenging budgetary times in the Commonwealth. Grossman, in his final meeting as chairman of the pension board, praised Trotsky’s “outstanding performance” in his four years managing the fund but said the pay raise should be implemented over a longer period. Taxpayers have a lot at stake in the fund. It’s a prudent investment to pay the people who manage your money. “This is not an appropriate time for compensation to be increased by that magnitude,” Grossman said. Government pay raises should come in the context of “the challenges that all the people of Massachusetts are going through,’’ he said. Grossman said he would say the same for the pay raises recommended this week by an advisory commission, which said the governor’s salary should be bumped up to 185,000 from 151,800 and the attorney general’s to 175,000 from 130,582. The treasurer’s pay also would rise. Board member Robert Brousseau said Trotsky deserved the added pay and has not received a merit increase or asked for a raise since taking the job in August 2010. Two years ago, Trotsky took on the duties of a second job with the fund, chief investment officer, for 50,000 more than he was making at the time. At 295,000, he is making less for two jobs than his predecessor, Michael Travaglini, did for one job. Travaglini’s base pay, excluding bonus, was 322,000. Fund officials said Trotsky has saved the plan 300,000 a year by doing both jobs. “I’m gratified by the confidence the board has shown in me and our entire team,” Trotsky said in a statement. “I look forward to working with the PRIM team to continue to grow and strengthen the [pension] fund through continued outstanding performance, in order to further reduce taxpayers’ pension obligations.” Trotsky said Tuesday the pension fund earned a 9.4 percent return for the 12 months ended Oct. 31, beating the 7.1 percent return of a benchmark of hypothetical funds. For the calendar year through October, the state fund has gained 6.9 percent, slightly more than a Vanguard Group fund that holds 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, which was up 6.5 percent. The best-performing parts of the fund this year have been long-term Treasury bonds — a sound bet made early this year that has delivered a 33 percent return. Private equity investments also have surged, climbing 24.7 percent. Trotsky took the top job at the fund after the financial crisis, when it had shed 24 percent of its value. In the succeeding four years, he has focused on taking risk out of the portfolio and cutting fees. Producing an average annual return exceeding 13 percent, he has beaten the Harvard University endowment every year. Treasurer-elect Deb Goldberg, who was not at the pension board meeting Tuesday, in a statement applauded Trotsky’s performance but opposed his raise. “When appropriate, it is critical that any compensation increases be implemented prudently and incrementally,” she said in the statement. Citing the threat of cuts for towns and cities, she said, “public servants need to also tighten their belts. In that context, a significant raise, albeit well-deserved, is uncomfortable and not necessarily appropriate at this time.” The list of highest-paid state employees in 2013 was dominated by UMass employees, with the top salary of 816,602 for Michael Collins, chancellor of the UMass Medical School and senior vice president of health services.

Article: Northern Europeans spend a lot of time in their cold and cloudy winters planning their summer holidays. They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red and ultra-violet rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

Write an article based on this summary: So what does the UK political upheaval mean for Brexit negotiations, slated to start in 10 days' time? Article:","completion":"Title: UK Political Upheaval - Implications for Upcoming Brexit Negotiations Introduction The political landscape in the United Kingdom has experienced drastic changes in the past few weeks, with significant implications for the upcoming Brexit negotiations, set to begin in 10 days' time. As the country faces various challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping the Brexit negotiations on track is essential to maintaining the international credibility of the United Kingdom. In this article, we will delve into the recent political upheavals and analyze their potential impact on Brexit negotiations. A Brief Overview of Recent UK Political Events The last few weeks have witnessed the resignation of various government officials within the UK, including critical figures in charge of handling the Brexit negotiations. These resignations were primarily due to internal political disagreements on the approach towards Brexit, which has fueled the current political chaos. As if the internal strife was not enough, external pressures in the form of disagreements with the European Union (EU) have added to the challenges the UK government currently faces. This combination of internal and external factors forms the backdrop for the impending Brexit negotiations. Impact of Political Instability on Brexit Negotiations 1. Weakened Negotiating Position The departure of key negotiators may weaken the UK's position in the Brexit negotiations. When experienced officials who are experts in their field leave their positions, they leave behind a potential vacuum. Filling this void may take time, and as a result, the UK may find itself in a less than ideal position to effectively negotiate with the EU. 2. Delayed Timeline for Negotiations The onset of resignations and political instability may also lead to a delay in the negotiations process. With a tight timeframe to work within, any delay may have far-reaching impacts on both the UK and EU as they seek to form agreements on key issues, including trade, immigration, and security. 3. Uncertainty Over The UK's Stance on Key Issues Political upheaval often leads to uncertainty in a nation's stance on particular issues. Such uncertainty may arise if key negotiators, who have championed a specific standpoint or policy, are no longer present to guide the discussions. This could make it difficult for the UK to effectively communicate and negotiate their intentions with the EU during the Brexit process. 4. Strained Relationship with EU For effective negotiations to take place, both parties need to trust one another and maintain a respectful discourse. However, the UK's political turmoil may have introduced an element of distrust and uncertainty on the part of the EU. This could potentially further complicate the negotiations if the EU perceives the UK as an unreliable negotiating partner. Final Thoughts The recent political upheaval in the United Kingdom comes at a critical time, with the nation poised to negotiate its future relationship with the European Union. As the political landscape continues to shift, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations will only increase. It is crucial for the UK government and its European counterparts to ensure that effective and amicable negotiations occur. They must overcome the current political chaos and its consequences in order to secure a resilient and prosperous future for both parties. In a rapidly changing global context, preserving the international credibility of the United Kingdom stands as a pressing priority."},{"prompt":"What type of details about elaine carbines can be gathered from the following bio?

Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

History of science The basis for classical economics forms Adam Smith's An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. Smith criticized mercantilism, advocating a system of free trade with division of labour. He postulated an \\"invisible hand\\" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory, called Marxian economics. Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, capitalism was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The Austrian school responded to Marxian economics by viewing entrepreneurship as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of supply and demand. Q: Who wrote An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations?","completion":"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations was written by Adam Smith, a Scottish economist and philosopher. The book, published in 1776, laid the foundations for classical economics and is considered one of the most important works in the history of economic thought.

Close  Celebrity Wedding Crashers of   Teen heartthrob Justin Bieber and then-girlfriend Selena Gomez were strolling on the beach in Malibu, Calif. in July 2011 when they heard Bieber's hit song \\"One Less Lonely Girl\\" playing at a local wedding reception. According to TMZ, the famous pair snuck up on some guests and then got on the mic to give the newlyweds a toast. \\"We just crashed it. We heard a party so we decided to just come. So let's party,\\" Bieber said in an exclusive video.

But according to the New York Daily News, no one really seemed to mind. In fact, some guests were all too eager to take some snapshots with the actor. John Travolta and Robin Williams once crashed a wedding together, but it was long before the two were big in Hollywood. According to USA Today, the friends had stopped to get a drink near Travolta's Santa Barbara home back in 1977.

The decision follows reports in the US and South Korea of the phone \\"exploding\\" during or after charging. The South Korean company said customers who had already bought the phone would be able to swap it for a new one. Samsung said it had been difficult to work out which phones were affected among the 2.5 million Note 7s sold. \\"There was a tiny problem in the manufacturing process, so it was very difficult to figure out,'' the president of Samsung's mobile business Koh Dong-jin told reporters. \\"It will cost us so much it makes my heart ache. Nevertheless, the reason we made this decision is because what is most important is customer safety,\\" he said. The firm said it would take about two weeks to prepare replacement devices. According to Samsung, the phone has been launched in 10 countries so far but with different companies supplying the batteries. The recall comes just one week ahead of an expected presentation of a new iPhone model from its main rival Apple. What makes lithium batteries catch fire? This is an extraordinary decision for a tech giant to make based on so few reported incidents - Samsung says it is aware of only 35 cases worldwide. It's bad timing so soon after a big product launch and especially given that Samsung's rival Apple is understood to be preparing to unveil a new iPhone. However, the firm says it has discovered a problem with the battery cell and is halting sales while it inspects its suppliers. People who have already bought the device - which is only available to pre-order in the UK - will be issued with a replacement. Stories about exploding smartphone batteries do make the news from time to time - lithium ion batteries are flammable but very widely used. Over the past few days, several users have reported their phones catching fire or exploding while charging, and Samsung said it had confirmed 35 such cases. A YouTube user uploaded a video under the name Ariel Gonzalez on 29 August of a Galaxy Note 7 with burnt rubber casing and damaged screen. He said the handset \\"caught fire\\" shortly after he unplugged the official Samsung charger, less than a fortnight after purchasing it. Further images of a burnt Galaxy Note 7 were uploaded to Kakao Story, a popular social media site in Korea, on 30 August. A user wrote: \\"There was another explosion of the Galaxy Note 7. It was my friend's phone. A Samsung employee checked the site and he is currently in talks over the compensation with Samsung. You should use its original charger just in case and leave the phone far away from where you are while charging.\\" The phone was only launched on 19 August and has since then been generally well-received by critics and consumers. The Galaxy Note 7 model is the latest of Samsung's series of so called phablets - smartphones with very large screens. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which lets users unlock the phone by detecting patterns in the eyes. In July, Samsung beat expectations with record earnings in the latest quarter with strong smartphone sales helping the firm post its best quarterly results in more than two years.

More than 62,000 incidents, including torture and rape, have been filed to the commission since 2013. Tunisia became a democracy after President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in 2011. The commission is investigating reports of police torture, corruption and murder over a 50-year-period since independence. Alleged abusers include Tunisia's previous state authorities and top security bosses. A quarter of alleged victims are women who have complained about sexual violence, formerly a taboo in Tunisia. The mother of a protester shot by security forces in 2011, Ourida Kadoussi, began the televised testimonies. \\"They killed our children. We have not been given our rights,\\" she said asking for freedom and dignity. The president of the Truth and Dignity Commission, Sihem Ben Sedrine, opened the forum saying: \\"Tunisia will not accept human rights abuses after today. This is the message from Tunisia.\\" London-based human rights charity Amnesty International has welcomed the hearings, saying victims \\"may finally have a chance to have their right to truth fulfilled\\". But the charity also said it is uncertain whether justice will be done. \\"The real test facing Tunisia's transitional justice process, however, is whether it will ultimately lead to criminal prosecutions for the crimes of the past decades.\\" Tunisians seek justice for past wrongs The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tunis says victims of abuse have each been given up to one hour to tell their stories to a panel of commissioners, and an audience including representatives of civic groups and international observers. The commission hopes that victims will forgive their alleged abusers. But many victims who have spoken to the BBC have demanded financial compensation and say the accused should be held accountable in court. The Truth and Dignity Commission says alleged abusers might also have a chance to give public testimonies in the near future. Two additional TV hearings are scheduled in December and January. Tunisia's uprising was the first of the 2011 Arab Spring, and often hailed as the most successful with the country now functioning as a parliamentary democracy. But across the country many struggle to find work amid a high unemployment rate. According to Reuters, the commission has said the hearings could boost economic investment \\"because foreign investors will know that Tunisia is dismantling its authoritarian and corrupt system\\". The country is due to host an investment conference at the end of November.

Meanwhile, he _ that China will stay committed to a peaceful development path and does not accept the logic that a country will seek hegemony(,) once it gets strong. \\"No one and nothing -- in any reason -- can influence China's determination and will to pursue the path of peaceful development,\\" he said.

He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been.

What is the answer?","completion":"The name of the Queen Mother's unfortunate 1957 Grand National horse, which includes the name of an English county, is Devon Loch. Devon Loch was a racehorse owned by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. The English county in its name is Devon, a county in southwestern England, known for its beautiful landscapes, coastlines, and historic landmarks. In the 1957 Grand National, a prestigious horse race held annually at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool, England, Devon Loch was the favorite to win under jockey Dick Francis. The race seemed to be going in his favor as Devon Loch was leading until the final moments. In a surprising and bizarre turn of events, just 50 yards from the finish line, Devon Loch suddenly and inexplicably leaped into the air and landed in a belly flop, allowing the second horse, E.S.B., to overtake him and win the race. The reason for Devon Loch's peculiar behavior remains a mystery to this day. Some speculated that the horse was spooked by a shadow from a nearby fence or was disoriented by the noise from the cheering crowd. Others suggested that it may have been experiencing a cramp or a sudden physical issue. Dick Francis, the jockey, believed that Devon Loch might have mistakenly identified a patch of water as an obstacle and attempted to jump over it. Despite the unfortunate event, Devon Loch's performance at the 1957 Grand National became an iconic moment in the history of horse racing, still frequently recalled and discussed. The phrase \\"Doing a Devon Loch\\" even entered the British lexicon as an idiom to describe a situation in which someone inexplicably snatches defeat from the jaws of victory at the last possible moment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How to make lemon ricotta cookies Preheat the oven to 375 ° f (190 ° c) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together the flour, baking powder and kosher salt in a medium bowl. Set the bowl aside.","completion":"Step 1: Prepare the wet ingredients In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar. You can do this using an electric mixer or with a whisk until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This will take about 3 to 5 minutes. This step is important because it helps create a tender texture in the cookies by incorporating air into the batter. Step 2: Beat in the eggs, ricotta cheese, lemon zest, and lemon juice Add the eggs one at a time to the butter and sugar mixture, beating well after each addition. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Then, mix in the ricotta cheese, followed by the lemon zest and lemon juice. It's crucial to mix these ingredients until just combined, so you don't end up with a tough or rubbery texture. Step 3: Combine the dry and wet ingredients Gradually add the flour mixture from the medium bowl to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cookie texture. Instead, fold the ingredients together with a spatula until you have a smooth, homogeneous dough. Step 4: Scoop and shape the dough Using a cookie scoop or two spoons, scoop small balls of dough onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. Leave about 2 inches of space between each ball of dough to allow for spreading while baking. Step 5: Bake the cookies Place the baking sheet into the preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden brown. Rotate the baking sheet halfway through the baking time to ensure even baking. Step 6: Cool the cookies Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Step 7: Prepare the glaze (optional) While the cookies are cooling, you can prepare a simple lemon glaze by whisking together powdered sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest until you achieve a smooth glaze. Step 8: Glaze the cookies (optional) Once the cookies have cooled completely, drizzle or spread the lemon glaze over the top of each cookie. Allow the glaze to set until firm, about 15 minutes.

The National Conference of State Legislatures held in Washington D.C. stated in a 2014 overview that many supporters for affirmative action argue that policies stemming from affirmative action help to open doors for historically excluded groups in workplace settings and higher education. Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace. By valuing diversity, employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population. By creating this diverse workforce, these employers and companies gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly global economy. According to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, many private sector employers have concluded that a diverse workforce makes a \\"company stronger, more profitable, and a better place to work.\\" Therefore, these diversity promoting policies are implemented for competitive reasons rather than as a response to discrimination, but have shown the value in having diversity.

She noticed that the egg moved faster on the countertop than on the rug. On which surface was more heat generated? (A) countertop (B) rug Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"marble countertop\\" and \\"knitted rug\\". A:","completion":"The marble countertop generated more heat than the knitted rug when Elizabeth rolled the egg on them. This observation can be explained by analyzing the differences in the properties and interactions of the two surfaces with the egg. First, let's consider the friction involved. Friction is the force that resists the relative motion or tendency of such motion between two surfaces in contact. It occurs as a result of the irregularities and interlocking between the microscopic contact points of the interacting surfaces. The amount of friction generated between the surfaces depends on the type of materials in contact and their respective surface roughness. In this scenario, the marble countertop is a smooth and hard surface with low roughness, which allows the egg to roll with less resistance. On the other hand, the knitted rug is a soft and textured surface with a higher degree of roughness, causing the egg to experience more resistance while rolling. When an object moves across a surface with friction, some of the kinetic energy from the motion is converted to thermal energy or heat due to the work done against the frictional force. As a result, the surface with higher friction will produce more heat. Since the egg encounters lower friction on the marble countertop than on the knitted rug, it can roll faster on the former. However, despite the difference in rolling speed, the marble countertop still generates more heat than the rug due to its higher thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat. Marble, being a type of stone, has relatively high thermal conductivity compared to the fibers used in a knitted rug. As the egg rolls over the marble countertop, it experiences a quicker transfer of thermal energy, or heat, from the contact points on the countertop than on the rug. The insulating nature of the rug's fibers is not conducive to rapid heat transfer, hence less heat generation during the rolling process. In conclusion, the marble countertop generates more heat than the knitted rug when the egg rolls on them, due to the combination of frictional forces and the differences in thermal conductivity between the two surfaces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tim Kaine greets crowd in Spanish as Clinton introduces VP pick in Miami Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s newly minted running mate, had barely taken his place at the podium in Miami when he started speaking Spanish. Related: Who is Tim Kaine? Clinton's 'smart political pick' for VP a bipartisan favorite “Bienvenidos a todos en nuestro pais, porque somos Americanos todos,” the senator from Virginia said. It translated to: “Welcome to everyone in our country, because we are all Americans.” Of Clinton, he said: “We’re going to be compañeros de alma [soulmates] in this great lucha [fight] ahead.” A crowd of thousands had queued for hours under the sweltering sun, lines snaking around the campus of Florida International University. They erupted into cheers. Not long after, Kaine asked those who were naturalized US citizens to raise their hands. A sizable chunk of the audience obliged in a county that is home to a majority Hispanic population. “Thank you for choosing us,” Kaine said, to another rousing reception. Such moments captured dramatically a tale of two elections: Clinton and Kaine embracing the changing demographics of America, Donald Trump surging to the Republican nomination on a staunch anti-immigration platform and a pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. In Miami, one voter, Michael Paul Massaria, turned to his wife and remarked: “We’re not hearing all that doom and gloom like we did at the Republican convention in Cleveland.” On multiple occasions, Kaine was interrupted with chants of “USA! USA!” – the sort of patriotism often on display at Republican events where time is dedicated to the projection of American strength. But the supporters who packed into this basketball stadium were celebrating a different vision, one in which America is defined by its diversity and multiculturalism. Bienvenidos a todos en nuestro pais, porque somos Americanos todos “We’ve got this beautiful country that should be a country of welcome, a country of inclusion,” Kaine said. He later vowed to advance comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, in the first 100 days of a Clinton presidency. Such promises could be seen as wishful thinking, as Barack Obama has learned during his time in the White House. But Massaria, from nearby Davie, was quick to observe the benefit. Kaine’s fluency in Spanish, he said, “will help down the line with bringing in the Latino vote, especially here in south Florida”. Attendees like Anna Alvarez, a 67-year-old naturalized citizen who moved to Miami 43 years ago, were a testament to the potential appeal of a vice-presidential candidate campaigning for the first time in English and Spanish. “He will get in his pocket the millions and millions of Hispanics that Trump lost,” she said. Alvarez had never seen Kaine before, a fact the senator invoked with the self-deprecating declaration: “Let me be honest: for many of you this is the first time you’ve heard my name.” Alvarez said: “I’m one of the ones that didn’t know his name, but he was incredible. He’s down to earth, I liked his background and his experience. I really like the way he was very proud of his wife.” Trump, she said, reminded her of the Cuban regime she fled from more than four decades ago. “I had the experience of [Fidel] Castro,” she said, “and Trump is a reminder of the dictators in the world. I am totally against anything that has to do with Trump.” Clinton, who sat beaming behind Kaine throughout his remarks, said in her introduction that America was united behind the “the confidence, the optimism that we are stronger together”. “I’m so thrilled to announce that my running mate doesn’t just share those values, he lives them,” she said. “Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and [his vice-presidentil pick] Mike Pence are not. He’s qualified to step into this job and lead on day one. And he is a progressive who likes to get things done.” Clinton announced late on Friday that she had picked Kaine, a senator from Virginia, following an extensive vetting process that lasted more than two months. Her choice followed a calculation that the working-class, swing-state senator could bolster her appeal not just among Latinos but also moderates and independents. A faction of progressives are less enthusiastic about Kaine’s centrist record, particularly his approach to the regulation of Wall Street and his support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Clinton’s former rival, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, did not immediately respond to the news. Clinton will formally accept the Democratic nomination for president this week, at the party’s national convention in Philadelphia. When I say he’s a progressive who likes to get things done, I mean it. He’s not afraid to take on special interests In Miami, Clinton touted Kaine as a “pragmatic progressive”. “When I say he’s a progressive who likes to get things done, I mean it. He’s not afraid to take on special interests,” Clinton said, adding that Kaine “cares more about making a difference than making headlines”. “And make no mistake. Behind that smile Tim also has a backbone of steel. Just ask the NRA.” Kaine was governor during the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, in which 32 students and faculty members were killed. The senator made reference to the tragedy on Saturday, pausing for a moment as he grew emotional. “It was the worst day of my life,” he said. Kaine recounted how he battled the National Rifle Association in his push for stricter gun laws, which eventually led to an executive order to bar firearm sales to individuals legally declared mentally ill or dangerous. Gun control has emerged as a prominent issue in the 2016 election. Kaine pledged: “We will not rest until we get universal background checks.” It was one of his biggest applause lines. Kaine also wasted little time going after Trump, invoking the real estate mogul’s recent comments that the US should not immediately come to the assistance of Nato allies unless they had fulfilled their obligations in return. “This drives home the stakes of this election,” Kaine said, noting that his son was a US Marine who would deploy next week to Europe “to uphold America’s commitment to our Nato allies”. He added: “Hillary Clinton is the direct opposite of Donald Trump. She doesn’t trash our allies – she respects them.” Trump last week chose Pence, the Indiana governor, as his vice-presidential candidate. A popular figure among evangelical conservatives and known, like Kaine, for his polite demeanor, Pence has nonetheless shed the nice-guy image in his new role as attack dog for Trump, echoing the real estate mogul’s message that Clinton is corrupt and disqualified from the presidency. Trump sought to brand Kaine as beholden to special interests, tweeting early on Saturday that Clinton had in effect rejected the will of progressives and Sanders backers. “Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks,” he said. “Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!” Later, Trump added: “Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. Isis and our other enemies are drooling. They don’t look presidential to me!” Related: Hillary Clinton's choice of Tim Kaine shows she's the real grown-up in this contest | Richard Wolffe Kaine appeared undeterred, though, in his second campaign appearance with Clinton in just two weeks. Earlier this month, he joined her on the stump in his home state. It was after that rally, aides said, that Clinton moved closer to settling on Kaine. She did not, however, reach a final decision until Friday evening. After placing calls to other top contenders for the job, Clinton called Kaine, who was at an event at a Massachusetts shipyard. He was greeted by top officials from the campaign and later received a congratulatory call from Obama, who nearly chose Kaine as his running mate in 2008. Kaine, who showed off a confident but freewheeling style on the stump, did not practice his speech, an aide said. In concluding his remarks, Kaine appealed once more against the divisive rhetoric of his opponents. “America is not built on fear,” he said, quoting President Harry Truman. “America is built on courage, on imagination and on an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand. “Tough times don’t last, but tough people do. And they don’t come tougher than Hillary Clinton.” Summary:","completion":"Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, spoke in Spanish while addressing the crowd at their joint event in Miami, enthusiastically embracing multiculturalism and the changing demographics in America.

In the ceremony held at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui, Chief Executive Donald Tsang handed the torch to the first torchbearer, Olympic medalist Lee Lai Shan. The torch relay then traveled through Nathan Road, Lantau Link, Sha Tin (crossed Shing Mun River via a dragon boat, which had been never used before in the history of Olympic torch relays), Victoria Harbour (crossed by Tin Hau, a VIP vessel managed by the Marine Department) before ending in Golden Bauhinia Square in Wan Chai. A total of 120 torchbearers were selected to participate in the event consisting of celebrities, athletes and pro-Beijing camp politicians. No politicians from the pro-democracy camp were selected as torchbearers. One torchbearer could not participate due to flight delay.

Swap out heavy moisturizers for lighter options that will keep you shine-free once spring rolls around. FIX: We hope you've been exfoliating throughout the winter months, but don't stop once the end of March rolls around! To keep your skin in tip-top shape, exfoliate at least once a week to get rid of unwanted dead skin cells. You'll help keep your pores clean while also brightening your skin FIX: It seems obvious (and it is) that the summer months aren’t the only time you should be applying sunscreen. Since your skin has basically been in hibernation, it’s imperative that you protect it from both UVA and UVB rays with a broad-spectrum sunscreen. MISTAKE: Not Cleaning Your Makeup Brushes FIX: Most of us have fallen victim to skipping this important step. Not only do unclean brushes cause breakouts, but they can inhibit makeup application, too. So the next time you’re test-driving the perfect smoky eye, wash your brushes in a gentle shampoo or cleanser before grabbing your eye shadow. FIX: Yes, it’s getting warmer! But before you layer on the bronzer, consider using a CC cream to brighten skin and provide a more natural look at the start of the season. If you’re desperately in need of allover color, try a tanning serum to allow for more even application without the risk of sun damage. FIX: The plums and deeper tones that are perfect for winter are not ideal for spring -- and this includes the hues on your nails! Go bold with neons and bright colors, and keep your makeup sweet and light. FIX: Don't forget to stock up on products that will keep your hair healthy this spring. Tame frizz and flyaways with a frizz-vanishing cream! MISTAKE: Jumping in the Water With Dry Hair FIX: Whether you're enjoying a warm spring day or your spring break vacation (lucky you!), take care of those luscious locks. When you soak your hair with water and conditioner before entering the pool or the ocean, it significantly reduces the damage that the harsh chlorine and salt can do to your hair. We could not be more excited for spring! With winter finally behind us, it's time to start working on our summer glow while enjoying more and more time outside. But before breaking out the flip-flops and culottes, you might want to rethink your current beauty routine. There are a handful of classic spring beauty mistakes we all make and can easily avoid with a few simple tricks.","completion":"This article outlines eight common spring beauty mistakes and provides solutions for each. They include swapping heavy moisturizers for lighter options, continuing to exfoliate weekly, applying sunscreen in spring, cleaning makeup brushes, using CC cream instead of bronzer, opting for bold nail colors, using frizz-vanishing cream to keep hair healthy, and soaking hair with water and conditioner before entering pools or the ocean.

It also appears to relay the group's new demand for the other's freedom: a prisoner exchange. The static image, shown in a video file posted by a known ISIS supporter, shows surviving Japanese hostage Kenji Goto, alone, in handcuffs and dressed in orange, holding a photo of what appears to be beheaded compatriot Haruna Yukawa. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday that the video is \\"highly credible.\\" U.S. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity.

The correct answer is \\"ISIS, the reports said\\" because the passage discusses a picture and audio posted online, which claims to show one of the two Japanese hostages being killed and includes a new demand for the other hostage's freedom. This content was posted by a known ISIS supporter, and both Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. authorities found the video to be credible. Therefore, the email in question likely came from ISIS. Other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - CNN, the reports said. CNN is a news reporting agency, not a group involved in the hostage situation, so they would not be sending the email. - Goto, the reports said. Kenji Goto is the surviving hostage in the article, so he wouldn't have sent the email. - Haruna Yukawa, the reports said. Haruna Yukawa is the beheaded hostage, so he couldn't have sent the email. - Japanese, the reports said. This option is too vague and doesn't specify a group or person within the Japanese government or population. - Jordan, the reports said. There is no mention of Jordan in the passage, so there is no evidence that the email would come from Jordan. - Kenji Goto, the reports said. As mentioned before, Kenji Goto is the surviving hostage in the article, so he wouldn't have sent the email. - Shinzo Abe, the reports said. Shinzo Abe, the Japanese Prime Minister, would not have sent the email, as he was reacting to the posted content by ISIS. - U.S., the reports said.

The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for the Brooks family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888., can you guess it ?

With a modest menu consisting of breakfasts (all day I thunk), burgers and sandwiches, it's easy to navigate and promotes the feeling that they don't do a lot, but what the do, they do well.

Photographs and descriptions of the inaugural gown and who designed it have been news for decades,\\" said Lisa Kathleen Graddy, the curator of The Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection at the National Museum of American History. \\"Sometimes sketches and descriptions of the dress and even formal photographs of the incoming first lady wearing the dress were released in advance to newspapers,\\" she said. After all, it is typically the country's collective first impression of the first lady. Mr. President, who are you wearing? Monday evening, the president and first lady will attend the Commander in Chief's Ball, which honors service members and their families, a tradition started by former President George W. Bush; and at the Inaugural Ball, the president and first lady will celebrate with people around the country who bought tickets to attend. At the 2009 inaugural balls, Michelle Obama donned a white chiffon, one-shoulder dress created by Jason Wu, a then up-and-coming, 26-year-old Taiwanese-born designer. She didn't reveal who or what she would be wearing until she stepped out that night. Wu's name is now mentioned in the same breath as heavy-hitting designers like Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Hererra, Marc Jacobs and Diane Von Furstenberg. That now-iconic gown is part of \\"A First Lady's Debut,\\" a collection on display at The Smithsonian. Included in the display are the gowns worn by the 11 most recent first ladies, beginning with Mamie Eisenhower. The museum also houses The First Ladies Collection, which displays clothing worn by earlier White House residents. \\"When we look at the gown that Jackie Kennedy wore 50 years ago, or the one that Mary Todd Lincoln wore more than a hundred years before that, it really takes us beyond the history books and the photographs, and it helps us understand that history is really made by real live people,\\" said the current first lady at the unveiling of her gown in March 2010. She continued: \\"The detail of each gown -- the fabric, the cut, the color -- tells us something much more about each single first lady. It's a visual reminder that we each come from such different backgrounds, from different generations, and from different walks of life.\\" Graddy said Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan in particular captured the look and feel of their eras -- the early '50s, '60s and '80s, respectively. Mamie Eisenhower's iconic inaugural ball gown was designed by Jewish-American fashion designer Nettie Rosenstein, who championed ready-to-wear fashion and is credited by many with popularizing the \\"little black dress.\\" It was a sparkling pink creation, made with 2,000 rhinestones. \\"First Lady Pink\\" soon became a popular color choice for ladies of the decade. While Eisenhower was quintessential 1950s, Jacqueline Kennedy went signature '60s with a gown by Ethel Frankau of Bergdorf Custom Salon. Frankau, who based the gown on descriptions and consultations with Mrs. Kennedy, created a slim, straight silhouette. A chiffon overlay covered an encrusted, off-white strapless bodice (wearing strapless couture without some sort of covering was considered risquÃ© at the time). Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan's hand-beaded gown by American couturier James Galanos cost 22,500 and oozed the Hollywood glamour that she and her actor-turned-politician husband brought to the White House. It's a given that no matter how handsome President Obama might look in his tuxedo at the galas, all eyes will be on his companion. \\"The first lady is both an American celebrity and one of the most visible representatives of the nation. She's 'our' first lady and our pride and interest, and curiosity, extends to what she wears,\\" Graddy said. See the past 100 years' worth of inaugural outfits in the gallery above.

In Chile, they’ve apparently killed a dog. The animal-welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals posted a pair of photos on its PETA Latino blog showing a small, short-haired dog dashing across a street in Santiago, Chile, and then in the second photo lying motionless on the pavement, apparently hit by the Google car that PETA says took the photos. In honor of the apparently deceased canine, PETA is asking Google to match its 1,000 donation to a Chilean spay-and-neuter group called the RIMA Foundation. Google could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon. ||||| GOOGLE doesn’t let mountains or oceans get in the way of mapping the world and it seems it won’t stop at animals either. Images from a street view car in Chile show what appears to be one of its camera-bearing cars running over a dog and leaving it for dead. If you take a trip down Meza Bell 2815, Chile on Google Maps you can re-live the moment, shot-by-shot, when a little canine trots in front of the path of the oncoming car — the next images seen from the car’s rear-facing camera show it lying on the road not moving. News.com.au followed the Google car’s path as it kept on driving and looking back as far as the zoom could stretch and did not see the pooch hop to its feet. Closer inspection of the more immediate images do show the dog moving in one image but it’s hard to tell whether this is a last struggle of life or whether he is just laying in the sun and having a stretch. A person can be seen at the side of the road where the ‘accident’ occurred but they didn’t rush to the rescue — perhaps a sign that the dog was in no danger? Or perhaps it’s another local who is used to the many stray street dogs in the area and this is not an unusual occurrence. This sort of thing also isn’t unusual for Google. In January last year it was accused of running over a donkey in Botswana after images on street view walking alongside the vehicle one moment then lying still on the ground the next. It was swiftly proven by Google that this wasn’t a hit-and-run and that the images were not as they appear. Google has said it is investigating the images regarding the dog to “understand and inform what happened” and reassure they “have guidelines in place to protect people and animals” as they map places around the world. To us, it looks like the dog has simply chosen a paw place to take a lie down. What do you think? Did Google kill this dog?

Is \\"In the Norman period, suffering the king's ill-will meant difficulties in obtaining grants, honours or petitions; Henry II had infamously expressed his fury and ill-will towards Thomas Becket; this ultimately resulted in Becket's death.\\" the correct answer? Choose your answer from: i. yes. ii. no.","completion":"i. Yes, the statement provided is a correct answer. During the reign of Henry II, suffering the king's ill-will indeed meant difficulties in obtaining grants, honours, or petitions. One of the most famous instances of Henry II expressing his fury and ill-will was towards Thomas Becket, who served as the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until his death in 1170. The relationship between Henry II and Thomas Becket began amicably, with Becket serving as the chancellor to the king before ascending to the position of Archbishop of Canterbury. However, after Becket became Archbishop, their friendly relationship took a turn for the worse. The key issue that caused the rift between Becket and Henry was a disagreement over the rights and privileges of the Church. As king, Henry II sought to reassert royal authority over the power of the clergy and the Church. Becket, on the other hand, resisted Henry's attempts, believing that the Church should retain its independence from the state. Their disagreements escalated over several years, with Becket facing several trials and ultimately fleeing to France for some time. Eventually, Becket returned to England, but the tensions between him and the king persisted, climaxing in Henry's infamous expression of fury and ill-will. In an outburst, Henry exclaimed, \\"Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\\" (although the exact phrasing of this quote is debated). Four knights, interpreting Henry's statement as a direct order, travelled to Canterbury and murdered Thomas Becket in the cathedral on December 29, 1170. In conclusion, the provided statement is correct. King Henry II infamously expressed his fury and ill-will towards Thomas Becket, ultimately resulting in Becket's death by the hands of the king's knights in 1170. This incident exemplified the repercussions of suffering the king's ill-will during the Norman period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Though she did not sign with Syco, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of \\"Walking in the Air\\" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, One Voice, and was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. Before the release of One Voice, it was revealed that Smith and her father were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on Britain's Got Talent.

Question: Where was the rogue element located that EDI took upon itself to attack? Movie title: Stealth Movie plot: U.S. Navy pilots Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), Henry Purcell (Jamie Foxx), and Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) are the best of the best. Captain George Cummings (Sam Shepard) chose them out of 400 pilots to fly the next generation of stealth fighter jets called Talons. After their flight training in the Talons, they have become a cohesive unit and a highly efficient fighting team. Captain Cummings adds a new \\"wingman\\" to the team, an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) that is being flown by \\"EDI\\", a computer with an artificial intelligence brain mounted in a ball inside the cockpit. On their first mission, EDI begins to learn the skills and attitudes of the other pilots, and quickly understands that he can fly the plane better and faster than men. EDI has the capability to process data faster, and under extreme speeds will not blackout. Returning to the aircraft carrier, EDI is struck by lightning, which begins to change the computer's circuits. On the next flight, EDI refuses to scrub a mission despite the potential for massive civilian casualties. Upon return to base, Ben implores Captain Cummings to remove EDI from duty for further testing; Cummings ignores Ben's objections, and EDI's computer tech (who was beginning to suspect EDI was going rogue) is mysteriously replaced by much more docile techs. EDI begins to think for itself, and assigns itself a mission to take out a radical element in China. EDI cuts his link with the flight controller on the carrier, and he will not take a direct order from Ben. Henry locates and chases EDI, and gives it an ultimatum: return to base, or he will take it out. EDI declines to return to base. Henry fires his missiles, misses EDI, and is himself killed by the explosions. If you thought it was unbelievable up 'til now, it gets worse.

One of the key aspects of interior design is the ability to identify and accentuate the room's focal point. A focal point is the visual center of attention in a room, typically a significant architectural element or a piece of furniture that captures the eye and anchors the overall design of the space. Finding the natural focal point in a room, or creating one when none exist, is essential in achieving a balanced and visually pleasing interior. This article will help you understand the importance of a focal point and guide you through the steps of creating the perfect focal point in any room. 1. Identify the Natural Focal Point Before diving into the realm of creating a focal point, assess the room and identify if it already has a natural focal point. Some rooms have a fireplace, large window, built-in bookshelf, or an architectural detail that automatically draws attention. If your room has a feature like this, think of ways to enhance and bring focus to that particular element. This can be achieved by arranging furniture around it, painting the wall a contrasting color, or adding eye-catching accessories. 2. Create a Focal Point in Rooms Without One Not every room has a natural focal point, but that doesn’t mean you can’t create one. Start by selecting a wall without windows or doors, as uninterrupted walls make an ideal surface for introducing a new visual anchor. Some effective ways to create a focal point in a room without one include: - Hanging a large piece of artwork or a statement mirror: A striking piece of art or a unique mirror can add depth and interest to the room. - Introducing a bold accent wall: Painting or adding wallpaper to a single wall can create a dramatic contrast and instantly become the center of attention. - Adding a significant piece of furniture: A large entertainment center, distinctive bookshelf, or grand piano can serve as a functional and attractive focal point. 3. Choose the Right Wall in an Oblong Room In an oblong or rectangular room, it's best to select the farthest short wall as the location for your focal point. Positioning the focal point on a shorter wall helps to balance the proportions of the room by drawing the eye to the other end, making the space feel less linear and more inviting. Consider creating a cozy seating area, a gallery wall, or an eye-catching storage solution on the shorter wall to leverage the space effectively. 4. Arrange Furniture and Accessories to Complement the Focal Point Once you've established the focal point in your room, you can begin to strategically place furniture and accessories to create a harmonious design. Arrange the seating and other furnishings in a way that draws attention to the focal point, allowing it to serve as an anchor for the room's layout. Use complementary colors and patterns to create cohesion and unity between the various design elements. 5. Don't Overload the Space While it's essential to create a captivating focal point, be mindful not to overwhelm the room with too many competing elements. The purpose of a focal point is to create a visual anchor and provide a sense of balance to the space. Overloading the room with multiple focal points or excessively bold design elements can result in visual chaos and disrupt the overall harmony of the interior. Conclusion Creating the perfect focal point in any room starts with understanding the natural focus of the space or creating one when none exist. Selecting the right wall, utilizing bold design elements, and strategically arranging furniture and accessories are key steps in achieving a balanced and visually pleasing interior. By following these guidelines, you can transform any room into a dynamic and cohesive space that leaves a lasting impression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer: West's controversial incident the following year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was arguably his biggest controversy, and led to widespread outrage throughout the music industry. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"No, the question was not answered in a detailed or extended manner. Here's a more comprehensive response: The biggest controversy involving Kanye West, an American rapper, songwriter, and fashion designer, undeniably took place at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. This event transpired on September 13, 2009, and it's since come to be known as the 'Taylor Swift Incident.' On that night, teen country singer Taylor Swift won the Best Female Video award for her song \\"You Belong with Me,\\" beating out several seasoned artists. As Swift started delivering her acceptance speech, Kanye West took to the stage uninvited, grabbed the microphone from her, and said something that would reverberate through the halls of pop culture history for years to come: \\"Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time.\\" West was referring to Beyoncé's music video for \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),\\" which hadn't won the award. His interruption and public disrespect of Swift during her moment of recognition was disrespectful and deemed an extreme exemplification of poor sportsmanship. The reaction to Kanye West's outburst was instantaneous and largely negative. The live audience booed him, a clear sign of their disapproval of his actions. Immediately, various celebrities like Pink, Katy Perry, and even the then-president Barack Obama condemned his actions. On social media platforms, the backlash was severe, with many viewers and fellow musicians labeling his behavior as arrogant and rude. The incident caused a significant stall in his career and damage to his reputation from which it took substantial time to recover. Beyoncé, the artist West was defending, was visibly uncomfortable and surprised by the incident. Later on in the evening, when she won the Video of the Year award for the same song, she invited Swift back onto the stage to finish her speech, a gesture widely seen as gracious and humble in stark contrast to West's previous outburst. In the years following the incident, Kanye West has issued several public apologies to Taylor Swift. In an interview on The Jay Leno Show just days after the incident, a contrite West expressed his regret and said he would like to apologize to Swift in person. However, the controversy saw a resurgence in 2016 with the release of West's song \\"Famous,\\" which referenced the incident and further offended Swift. As a result, the controversy at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards is seen as the most significant in Kanye West's career, marking a remarkable turning point in the depiction of his public persona. The repercussions and constant revisitals of the incident continue to affect his image and public perception."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war. Question: \\"What caused the Malay ruling class to take a back seat?\\" Answer: \\"The Chinese fomented a revolution\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, this answer is not correct. The Malay ruling class took a back seat because the British extended their control over the peninsula and effectively took control of the rubber and tin industries. The British also held the reins of government, leaving the Malay ruling class in charge of only local and religious affairs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics. Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said. Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are. This is an election to tell the world who we are and what we stand for.\\" Question: What is probably true about the Senate position in Alabama?

News article: Augusten Burroughs Makes a Dash for the Country Perfection comprised five fireplaces; well-worn wide-plank floors; 12-over-12 windows, most with the original panes; and a sunroom with grand views of the unruly water. There was lots of space for the couple’s three dogs to roam. Bookshelves were everywhere — they even run up the vertiginous back staircase. (The wise will grab hold of the pieces of antique plow harness that were repurposed as safety grips and affixed to the wall.) “The house was built with the expectation that you’re going to need to have a book no matter where you’re sitting at any given moment,” Mr. Burroughs said. “And here’s a place to put it.” Delightfully, everything is just a bit off plumb. This may include the house’s inhabitants, whose kitchen bookshelves bulge with unlikely titles such as “Rosemary’s Baby,” “Middlesex” and “Celebrity Detox.” Among the few cookbooks, Mr. Schelling said in an email, are “three ancient, falling-apart, slightly scary Southern ones that were Augusten’s grandmother’s, and a salmonella-stained hardcover set of ‘Mastering the Art of French Cooking.’ They’re in a cupboard with the dog treats. Of course.” What renovating the couple undertook was in the name of backdating rather than updating. Dismayed by a bathroom that a previous owner had modernized in the 1990s and that featured a fiberglass shower unit, Mr. Burroughs and Mr. Schelling recently redid it in 1930s style, with small handmade tiles and period-appropriate fixtures. The schoolhouse turned kitchen — it’s still got a bell on the roof — was determinedly left untouched. “There are old houses that have super-modern kitchens with granite counters, and that’s lovely, but it’s not what we wanted,” Mr. Burroughs said. “This house has been beautifully maintained and cared for, but it hasn’t been bastardized.” He and Mr. Schelling have made some effort to confine their furniture choices to antiques. The Eastlake bed in the master bedroom is from the late 19th century. An English table with barley-twist legs and a dresser with the initials “ES,” both from the early 18th century, sit in opposite corners of the living room. “I love old things, because I feel if something has survived a few hundred years of use, I’m probably not going to destroy it,” said Mr. Burroughs, who nonetheless didn’t think twice about grabbing a pair of capacious wing chairs, antique reproductions, for 75 each at a yard sale. “We’re not purists,” he said. “To be a purist requires a level of living skills that I don’t possess. And we didn’t want anything precious. Christopher and I aren’t fancy, and we have three dogs.” On the walls are paintings of animals, peculiar-looking children and their elders, as well as some family portraits by Mr. Burroughs’s mother, Margaret Robison. “While we had a broken relationship, I do love these works of art,” said Mr. Burroughs, who chronicled that broken relationship in “Running With Scissors,” an account of his wretched, highly dysfunctional childhood. In 2005, he and his publisher were sued for libel by the family that took him in when he was a teenager. The matter was settled for an undisclosed sum. Mr. Burroughs has made a career out of strip-mining his past. But he seems no less interested in considering the pasts of others, in pondering the previous lives that were lived in his home. “Certain places I stand in seem like the exactly perfect spot for standing,” he said, holding his ground in just such a spot in the living room. “And I wonder if other people have realized that same thing through the years. And if you lean in a certain way against the window in the master bedroom, there’s a perfect view of the full moon. I’m sure people have been leaning against that windowsill looking at the moon for hundreds of years.” He savors what was left behind when he and Mr. Schelling moved in. These treasures include the dresser in the master bedroom, “but also an odd assortment of things left in exactly the place you need them,” Mr. Burroughs said. “You’ll be swatting a fly in the changing room and you’ll find sticking out from the top shelf of the closet the handle of a fly swatter with a daisy on it.” Come summer, the couple may spruce up the guest cottage so Mr. Burroughs can go out there to work. For the moment, he happily floats around the house with his laptop, setting up shop on a table in the living room, on the tufted green-velvet sofa or on the built-in wood bench in the attic. “Maybe it’s because I grew up in the country, but I love it here,” he said. “As energizing and dynamic as the city is, I’m boring. I’m a writer.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article talks about how Augusten Burroughs, a writer, moved to a beautiful old country house with his partner, Mr. Schelling. The house has a lot of history and interesting design features, like five fireplaces and many bookshelves. They've made some changes to the house, trying to keep it true to its history.

When the sons came back, the old man asked them to say what they had seen. The first son complained the tree was ugly. The second son said the tree was covered with buds and full of hope. The third son said the tree was full of green leaves. They looked so beautiful, and it was the most wonderful thing he had ever seen. The youngest son said that the tree was bowed down with heavy fruits. It was full of life and fulfillment .

First, I identified the subject, verb, and objects within the sentence. The sentence has three parts: 1. He's starving for us 2. He's working tirelessly for us 3. My heart just broke for him. For each part, I found the appropriate Yoruba words or phrases that express the same meaning as the English words. 1. He's starving for us: The subject is \\"he\\", the verb is \\"starving\\", and the object is \\"us\\". In Yoruba, the word for \\"he\\" is \\"oun\\", \\"starving\\" can be translated to \\"ń jẹun sìní,\\" and \\"for us\\" to \\"fún wa\\". Putting it together, we have \\"Oun ń jẹun sìní fún wa\\". 2. He's working tirelessly for us: The subject remains \\"he\\". The verb is \\"working tirelessly,\\" which can be translated to \\"şìşẹ́ gbẹ̀rẹ̀\\" in Yoruba. By adding \\"for us\\" which is \\"fún wa\\", it becomes \\"Oun şìşẹ́ gbẹ̀rẹ̀ fún wa\\". 3. My heart just broke for him: In this part, the subject is \\"my heart\\". The Yoruba translation for \\"my heart\\" is \\"ọkàn mi\\". The verb is \\"broke\\", which can be translated to \\"darú\\" in Yoruba. Adding \\"for him\\", which is \\"fún un\\" in Yoruba, the whole phrase becomes \\"Ọkàn mi darú fún un\\".

Many approaches have been made using cameras and computer vision algorithms to interpret sign language. However, the identification and recognition of posture, gait, proxemics, and human behaviors is also the subject of gesture recognition techniques. Gesture recognition can be seen as a way for computers to begin to understand human body language, thus building a richer bridge between machines and humans than primitive text user interfaces or even GUIs (graphical user interfaces), which still limit the majority of input to keyboard and mouse. - Buzz! is a series of video games originated by Sleepydog Ltd., developed by Relentless Software and published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable consoles.

Bethenny Frankel's ex-manager wants 100 million Bethenny Frankel recently told the Hollywood Reporter that her reality show fame helped her make 120 million and now her ex-manager wants a piece of that. THR reports that the Bravo star is being sued by the Los Angeles-based management company Raw Talent for 100 million. The lawsuit says the company helped to broker Frankel's recent venture to sell her Skinnygirl Margarita brand to Fortune Brand's Beam Global Spirits & Wine unit and that Raw Talent was later cut out of the deal. Frankel declined to comment to CNN. The company's co-president, Doug Wald, claims in the suit that she signed with the firm in 2008 and orally agreed to make Wald her personal manager and pay Raw Talent 10 percent of her earnings. The suit also says Wald linked Frankel with David Kanbar, a liquor industry veteran who has worked with Skyy Vodka and went on to partner with the reality star. Wald says his company was fired days before Frankel signed a development and marketing deal for her Skinnygirl brand. Wald also says he introduced Frankel to some agents after she expressed interest in having her own reality series after she found success on \\"The Real Housewives of New York.\\" Frankel went on to star in Bravo's \\"Bethenny Getting Married\\" and the current follow-up \\"Bethenny Ever After.\\" UPDATE 4:05 p.m. - CNN received the following statement from Frankel: \\"Unfortunately, one of the signs of success is being the subject of frivolous lawsuits, like this one.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kevin Maurice Garnett (born May 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played the power forward and center positions. In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. On February 19, 2015, Garnett agreed to waive his no-trade clause in order to be traded back to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young. Six days later, he made his return for the Timberwolves against the Washington Wizards at the Target Center, recording five points on 2-of-7 shooting with eight rebounds and two blocks in 19 minutes in his first game for Minnesota since 2007. He appeared in just five games for the Timberwolves in 2014-15, before sitting out the team's final 21 games of the season due to a nagging knee injury. On July 11, 2015, Garnett re-signed with the Timberwolves to a two-year deal. On November 15, 2015, Garnett became the fifth player in NBA history to play at least 50,000 minutes. He joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Jason Kidd and Elvin Hayes. Garnett played a season-high 23:54 against the Memphis Grizzlies, recording eight points, five rebounds and four assists. On November 23, he had a season-best game with 8 points and 10 rebounds in a 100-95 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 1, he recorded four points and eight rebounds in 20 minutes against the Orlando Magic, surpassing Jason Kidd (50,110) for third on the NBA's career minutes list. Four days later, in a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the 15th player in NBA history to surpass 26,000 career points. On December 11, 2015, Garnett passed Karl Malone as the NBA's all-time leader in defensive rebounds during Minnesota's 111-108 overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. He finished the game with four defensive boards to give him 11,409 for his career, three ahead of Malone. Garnett appeared in 38 of the team's first 45 games of the season before missing the entire second half of the season with a right knee injury, the same knee that kept him out of 25 games in 2008-09 when he was playing for Boston, as well as much of his post-trade time in Minnesota during the 2014-15 season. On September 23, 2016, Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. While Garnett did express interest in playing for one more season with the Timberwolves, primarily with the goal in helping the team make it to the playoffs again with its promising young players and new head coach, he also told the team's owner that he wasn't sure that his knees would hold up for one more season.

A UK regulator had recommended the inspection after a fire broke out on a 787 Dreamliner jet parked at Heathrow airport earlier this month. It was traced to the upper rear part of the plane where the part - Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) - is fitted. Boeing said it had asked operators of 717, Next-Generation 737, 747-400, 767 and 777 planes to inspect aircraft. \\"We're taking this action following the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) Special Bulletin, which recommended that airplane models with fixed Honeywell ELTs be inspected,\\" Randy Tinseth, vice president marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a blog post. \\"The purpose of these inspections is to gather data to support potential rulemaking by regulators.\\" As a result of the fire on the parked Ethiopian Airlines plane, London's Heathrow airport was closed for 90 minutes. After the fire, the regulator had asked all Boeing 787s switch off an electrical component until further notice and suggested a safety review of similar components in other aircraft. In a statement, the AAIB had said that the component needed more \\"airworthiness action\\". It had said that \\"it was not clear whether the combustion in the area of the ELT was initiated by a release of energy within the batteries or by an external mechanism such as an electrical short\\". It added that as the the ceiling space where the ELT is located does \\"not typically carry the means of fire detection... had this event occurred in flight it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin crew in tackling the resulting fire\\". Honeywell International, the company that makes the emergency transmitters, had said that it backed the proposal to switch them off while investigations continued, but added that it was \\"premature to jump to conclusions\\". Last week, two airlines disclosed issues with the wiring on their Boeing 787's emergency transmitters, Japan's All Nippon Airways (ANA), the world's biggest operator of Dreamliners, said last week it found damage to the battery wiring on two 787 locator transmitters during checks.

What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations.

The accession talks have been stalled for quite some time, with the last significant milestone being the opening of the 16th chapter of negotiations back in 2016. However, despite these challenges, the European Commission's statement indicates a renewed interest and commitment to moving the discussions forward. This could be due to the changing geopolitical landscape and the need for stronger collaboration to tackle global issues such as climate change, terrorism, and the recent refugee crisis. For the accession talks to be successful, Turkey would need to demonstrate progress in addressing these critical areas while displaying a willingness to align itself more closely with the values and norms of the European Union. The European Union, on the other hand, would need to show flexibility in its approach and be prepared to engage in serious dialogue with Turkey, keeping in mind the importance of this strategic partnership. In conclusion, the European Commission's call for more rapid accession talks with Turkey underscores the need for a constructive and pragmatic approach to navigating this complex process. This would require both sides to demonstrate a commitment to shared goals, mutual respect, and a spirit of collaboration, fostering stronger ties between Turkey and the European Union amidst an increasingly challenging global environment."},{"prompt":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Why do monks meditate?\\" is in \\"Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth.

Treasuries Mirror Oil's Climb NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields hit their lowest level in almost seven months on Monday as record high oil prices clouded the outlook for global economic growth. Multi-choice problem: What is this text about? Available choices: a. World. b. Sports. c. Business. d. Science/Tech.","completion":"This text is about the business domain, specifically relating to the financial market and the economic impact of rising oil prices. It discusses how U.S. Treasury yields reached their lowest level in nearly seven months due to the influence of record high oil prices, which in turn affects the global economic growth outlook. The excerpt is from a news report in the business context, as it highlights important financial indicators which are Treasury yields in the United States and how they are being affected by the increasing oil prices. Rising oil prices have a significant impact on the global economy, as it is an essential commodity required for transportation, industrial production, and various consumer goods. Higher oil prices can increase production costs, inflate consumer prices, and affect trade balances for countries heavily reliant on oil imports. As a result, the text touches upon the implications of the increasing oil prices on Treasury yields, a key financial market instrument that reflects investor sentiment on the overall well-being of the economy. Treasuries are debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the country's spending needs. The yield on these securities is inversely related to their prices and serves as an indicator for interest rates and economic growth expectations. A lower yield often indicates a weaker outlook for the economy, pushing investors to seek safer investments like government bonds. In this case, the declining Treasury yields are connected to the potentially negative consequences of the rising oil prices, which can hinder global economic growth and create uncertainty in the financial markets. Hence, the text pertains to the business sector, with emphasis on finance and how global economic conditions are reflected in the U.S. Treasury yields, which, in turn, are influenced by the fluctuations in oil prices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip. The officer said when he picked the man up at the station; he looked at the officer and smiled. He recognized his neighbor.

Background: Samuel de Champlain (also known as \\"The Father of New France) (French: [samYel d@ Saple] born Samuel Champlain; on or before August 13, 1574 - December 25, 1635), \\"The Father of New France\\", was a French navigator, cartographer, draftsman, soldier, explorer, geographer, ethnologist, diplomat, and chronicler. He made from 21-29 trips across the Atlantic, and founded New France and Quebec City on July 3, 1608. He is important to Canadian history because he made the first accurate map of the coast and he helped found the settlements. Context: In the spring of 1608, Dugua wanted Champlain to start a new French colony and fur trading center on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Dugua equipped, at his own expense, a fleet of three ships with workers, that left the French port of Honfleur. The main ship, called the Don-de-Dieu (French for the Gift of God), was commanded by Champlain. Another ship, the Levrier (the Hunt Dog), was commanded by his friend Du Pont. The small group of male settlers arrived at Tadoussac on the lower St. Lawrence in June. Because of the dangerous strength of the Saguenay River ending there, they left the ships and continued up the \\"Big River\\" in small boats bringing the men and the materials. On July 3, 1608, Champlain landed at the \\"point of Quebec\\" and set about fortifying the area by the erection of three main wooden buildings, each two stories tall, that he collectively called the \\"Habitation\\", with a wooden stockade and a moat 12 feet (4 m) wide surrounding them. This was the very beginning of Quebec City. Gardening, exploring, and fortifying this place became great passions of Champlain for the rest of his life. In the 1620s, the Habitation at Quebec was mainly a store for the Compagnie des Marchands (Traders Company), and Champlain lived in the wooden Fort Saint Louis newly built up the hill (south from the present-day Chateau Frontenac Hotel), near the only two houses built by the two settler families (the ones of Louis Hebert and Guillaume Couillard, his son-in-law). Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article about Samuel de Champlain, \\"The Father of New France.\\" 1. Cartography Skills: Champlain was an accomplished cartographer, which played an important role in mapping the Canadian coastline. His accurate maps were crucial for navigation, the establishment of trade routes, and exploration of the territories. His cartographic skills helped the French government and other explorers to understand and utilize the new lands more effectively. 2. Diplomatic Relations with Indigenous People: Champlain focused on establishing good relations with the Indigenous peoples living in New France. He learned their languages and customs, engaged in trade, and formed alliances for mutual benefits. This approach played a significant role in the success of New France, as it enabled the French to secure valuable trade routes and resources. 3. Explorations and Discoveries: Champlain conducted numerous explorations across the North American continent. Some of his notable journeys include the exploration of Ottawa River, which ultimately led to the discovery of the Great Lakes, an essential part of the North American continent. He also explored what is now known as the Bay of Fundy and Lake Champlain, named after him. 4. Military Career: Champlain was also a soldier and took part in various military campaigns during his time. Some of his notable contributions include his role in the battle against the Iroquois Confederacy, during which he utilized European tactics and weapons, significantly influencing the outcome in favor of the French and their Huron allies. 5. Influence on Quebec City's Development: Champlain's influence on the development of Quebec City is also worth mentioning. As the founder of the city, he made significant efforts to fortify the settlement, build infrastructure such as forts, gardens, and living quarters, and establish trade with the Indigenous peoples. His tireless endeavors allowed Quebec City to prosper and become a central hub in New France. 6. Legacy and Impact on Canadian History: Samuel de Champlain's contributions to the establishment and development of New France significantly shaped Canadian history. His explorations, diplomacy, and vision for a thriving French settlement set the foundation for modern-day Quebec and influenced various aspects of Canadian culture and relations with Indigenous peoples. In conclusion, the article about Samuel de Champlain offers many fascinating details on his life, his explorations, and his vital role in the founding and development of New France. From his mapping abilities to his diplomatic skills, Champlain's legacy continues to influence and shape Canadian history today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In accordance with the 25th Amendment, he is the highest-ranking official in the presidential line of succession, and is a statutory member of the National Security Council under the National Security Act of 1947. Question: is the vice president president of the senate?","completion":"Yes, the Vice President of the United States serves as the President of the Senate according to the U.S. Constitution. This role is clearly defined in Article I, Section 3, Clause 4, of the United States Constitution. The Vice President's position as President of the Senate makes them a pivotal figure within the legislative branch of the federal government. Their primary duty in this role is to preside over Senate sessions. However, it should be noted that the Vice President does not have a vote in the Senate, except in the case where there is a tie on a piece of legislation or matter being decided on. In such an instance, the Vice President, as President of the Senate, casts the tie-breaking vote. This makes the Vice President the only individual who holds positions in both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government, thus serving a crucial bridge between the two. The Vice President has a significant responsibility to ensure smooth legislative proceedings and contribute to the maintenance of a beneficial relationship between the executive and legislative branches. Moreover, the Vice President plays an instrumental part in the presidential line of succession. As noted in the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, the Vice President is the first in line to assume the presidency if for any reason the President is unable to serve. This highlights the importance of the Vice President's role not only as a legislative leader but also as a key figure in the executive branch. The Vice President is also recognized as a statutory member of the National Security Council as per the National Security Act of 1947. This designates them an official role in national security and foreign policy decisions, further extending their influence and responsibilities in the U.S. government.

Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas. When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

Summarize: For most women, vaginal discharge is perfectly normal and can range from being clear to milky white. Abnormal discharge will look greenish-yellow and frothy. A strong odour is also a sign of abnormal discharge. Trichomoniasis is spread through contact with vaginal discharge which happens most often during vaginal intercourse. However, non-sexual transmission can sometimes occur from penetration from other items like douche nozzles. Fortunately, the parasite can only last up to 24 hours outside of the body. Trichomoniasis can cause redness, burning, and itching sensations at the genitals in some infected individuals. These symptoms may indicate a possible trichomoniasis infection or that of another STI. Trichomoniasis causes irritation within the vaginal canal or vulva. Vaginal irritation can be normal if the irritation only lasts for a few days or gets better after treatment. However, if irritation persists or gets worse, it's best to talk to your doctor about it and get it properly diagnosed and treated. Trichomoniasis can cause inflammation and soreness in the genitals that can make intercourse uncomfortable. See a physician if you experience these symptoms, and do not participate in intercourse until you have been tested for STIs or STDs. Avoid all forms of sexual intercourse including anal and oral sex until you've been tested and cleared. You should also inform your sexual partner or partners if you suspect you have an STI/STD and encourage them to also get tested and treated. Some clinics will help you inform your partners anonymously by giving them a contact slip that lets them know they have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection. It won't have your name on it and it won't necessarily tell them what the infection is.","completion":"Vaginal discharge is normal for women, but abnormal discharge with a strong odor may indicate an infection like trichomoniasis.

The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \\"year\\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \\"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \\"Guo Nian\\". The word \\"Guo Nian\\" means \\"go through the Nian safely\\". Putting up red paper-cuts to drive Nian away and making dumplings for a better new year are still an every-year doing by the Chinese people. However, people today have long forgotten why they are doing all this, they just feel the color and the food make the New Year very enjoyable.

Question: This article: The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound.

He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar.

News article: Commuting is among life's least enjoyable activities, according to research by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman and others. The graph below shows the cities with the worst commutes in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index (via Wired). The city with the world's worst commute, according to the IBM study, is Beijing, followed by Mexico City, Johannesburg, Moscow, and New Delhi. London, New York, L.A., and my adopted hometown of Toronto also rank in the top 20. Stockholm has the world's best commute among the 20 cities in the IBM survey. Commuting is a waste of energy and time, and carries with it enormous economic costs. Commuting costs America an estimated 90 billion dollars per year in terms of lost productivity and wasted energy, according to the annual Urban Mobility Report. Our own detailed calculations by Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) research director Kevin Stolarick find that every minute shaved off America's commuting time is worth an estimated 19.5 billion dollars. That translates into 97.7 billion for five minutes, 195 billion for 10 minutes, and 292 billion for every 15 minutes saved nationally. The chart below from the IBM study shows the percentage of drivers in each of the 20 surveyed cities who would work more if their commuting time was significantly reduced. The index is based on IBM surveys of 8,192 motorists in 20 cities across six continents: The index is comprised of 10 issues: 1) commuting time, 2) time stuck in traffic, agreement that: 3) price of gas is already too high, 4) traffic has gotten worse, 5) start-stop traffic is a problem, 6) driving causes stress, 7) driving causes anger, 8) traffic affects work, 9) traffic so bad driving stopped, and 10) decided not to make trip due to traffic. We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com. ||||| Quit whining about your commute. It isn’t that bad, even for you Angelinos and New Yorkers. Your daily slog through traffic is nothing compared to Moscow, where people might spend more than three hours sucking exhaust fumes while going nowhere fast. Even that pales compared to New Delhi, where 96 percent of drivers say their commute is so hellish it harms their health. And you’ll get no sympathy in Beijing, where traffic can get so bad that almost 7 out of 10 drivers have at some point said, “Screw this” and gone home. Number-crunchers at IBM Research surveyed 8,192 motorists in 20 cities, and — no surprise — most of them think traffic has only grown worse during the past three years. More than half said gridlock has wreaked havoc on their physical or mental health. One-third said it is undercutting their productivity at work or school. As IBM notes, mounting congestion is relatively new phenomenon in emerging markets where the economy is growing faster than the infrastructure. That stands in contrast to cities like New York, Houston and Los Angeles, where growth has occurred over time, allowing traffic engineers to at least try to keep up. But no matter the cause, we can’t pave our way out of this. “Traditional solutions — building more roads — will not be enough to overcome the growth of traffic in these rapidly developing cities, so multiple solutions need to be deployed simultaneously to avoid a failure of the transportation networks,” says Naveen Lamba, who has the unusual title of IBM global industry lead for intelligent transportation. “New technologies are required that empower transportation officials to better understand and proactively manage the flow of traffic.” You’d expect IBM to say that since it is developing just that sort of technology. But the numbers back it up. China is the world’s largest auto market, and traffic volume in Beijing is growing 10 percent annually. Moscow says unsnarling its roads will cost 6.5 billion. The average traffic speed in New Delhi will fall from 15 km/hr to just 5 by the end of next year. The list goes on. IBM used the results to compile a “Commuter Pain Index,” which ranks the emotional and economic toll of commuting. The index is a measure of 10 criteria, from the amount of time spent sitting in traffic to the frequency with which people simply gave up and went home. Here it is, by the numbers: Some highlights, or maybe we should say low points, from the study: Forty-nine percent of respondents say traffic has gotten worse in the past three years and 18 percent say it is a lot worse. Oddly, 16 percent of those surveyed in Beijing and 17 percent of those in New Delhi say things have improved. Almost nine in 10 respondents say they’ve sat in gridlocked traffic at some point during the past three years. The average delay was 1 hour, but Muscovites wish it was that long. They’re used to spending an average of 2.5 hours sitting still in the worst tie-ups. Forty percent said they’ve spent three hours or more in stymied traffic. Thirty-one percent of respondents said they’ve encountered traffic so bad they simply turned around and went home. That number climbed to 69 percent for residents of Beijing. Here in the United States, 85 percent of respondents say traffic is as bad or worse now than it was three years ago. But that doesn’t mean they’re about to change their behavior. More than 8 in 10 people drive solo to work — compared to 50 percent for the rest of the world — and only 3.1 percent carpool. Perhaps that’s why we spend more money driving than we do on groceries. IBM’s web-based survey, conducted by Survey Sampling International in 2008 and 2009 and released today, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 points overall and plus or minus 5 points when comparing cities. Respondents were drivers between 18 and 65 years old. Photo of just another traffic jam in Moscow: Leszek Golubinski/Flickr ||||| Armonk, NY - 30 Jun 2010: -- Moscow copes with the two-and-a-half hour traffic jam -- Despite congestion, Beijing drivers report improvement in traffic -- Houston, New York and Los Angeles fare well, relatively speaking The daily commute in some of the world's most economically important international cities is longer and more grueling than before imagined, reflecting the failure of transportation infrastructure to keep pace with economic activity, according to IBM's (NYSE: IBM) first global Commuter Pain study released today. IBM surveyed 8,192 motorists in 20 cities on six continents, the majority of whom say that traffic has gotten worse in the past three years. The congestion in many of today's developing cities is a relatively recent phenomenon, having paralleled the rapid economic growth of those cities during the past decade or two. By contrast, the traffic in places like New York, Los Angeles or London has developed gradually over many decades, giving officials more time and resources to address the problem. For example, the middle class in China is growing rapidly, with the number of new cars registered in Beijing in the first four months of 2010 rising 23.8% to 248,000, according to the Beijing municipal taxation office. Beijing's total investments in its subway system are projected to be more than 331.2 billion yuan by 2015 as the city expands the system to more than double its current size, according to Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co., Ltd. The city plans to invest 80 billion yuan in 2010 in building its transportation infrastructure. The study did offer a number of bright spots. Forty eight percent of drivers surveyed in Beijing reported that traffic has improved in the past three years – the high for the survey – reflecting substantial initiatives to improve the transportation network in that city. In addition, the commute for drivers in Stockholm, Sweden seems to be, if not pleasant, then largely pain-free. Only 14% of Stockholm drivers surveyed said that roadway traffic negatively affected work or school performance. Overall, though, the study paints a picture of metropolitan-area commuters in many cities struggling to get to and from work each day. For example, 57% of all respondents say that roadway traffic has negatively affected their health, but that percentage is 96% in New Delhi and 95% in Beijing. Similarly, 29% overall say that roadway traffic has negatively affected work or school performance, but that percentage rises to 84% in Beijing, 62% in New Delhi, and 56% in Mexico City. Moscow was notable for the duration of its traffic jams. Drivers there reported an average delay of two-and-a-half hours when asked to report the length of the worst traffic jam they experienced in the past three years. IBM Commuter Pain Index IBM compiled the results of the survey into an Index that ranks the emotional and economic toll of commuting in each city on a scale of one to 100, with 100 being the most onerous. The Index reveals a tremendous disparity in the pain of the daily commute from city to city. Stockholm had the least painful commute of the cities studied, followed by Melbourne and Houston (which tied) and New York City. Here's how the cities stack up: The index is comprised of 10 issues: 1) commuting time, 2) time stuck in traffic, agreement that: 3) price of gas is already too high, 4) traffic has gotten worse, 5) start-stop traffic is a problem, 6) driving causes stress, 7) driving causes anger, 8) traffic affects work, 9) traffic so bad driving stopped, and 10) decided not to make trip due to traffic. The cities scored as follows: Beijing: 99, Mexico City: 99, Johannesburg: 97, Moscow: 84, New Delhi: 81, Sao Paolo: 75, Milan: 52, Buenos Aires: 50, Madrid: 48, London: 36, Paris: 36, Toronto: 32, Amsterdam: 25, Los Angeles: 25, Berlin: 24, Montreal: 23, New York: 19, Houston: 17, Melbourne: 17, Stockholm: 15. \\"Traditional solutions -- building more roads -- will not be enough to overcome the growth of traffic in these rapidly developing cities, so multiple solutions need to be deployed simultaneously to avoid a failure of the transportation networks,\\" said Naveen Lamba, IBM's global industry lead for intelligent transportation. \\"New techniques are required that empower transportation officials to better understand and proactively manage the flow of traffic.\\" IBM Global Commuter Pain Survey – Major Findings Analysis of the survey results indicated a number of key findings related to how traffic impacts commuters: The Commuter Pain Survey was conducted by IBM to better understand consumer thinking toward traffic congestion as the issue reaches crisis proportions nationwide and higher levels of auto emissions stir environmental concerns. These events are impacting communities around the world, where governments, citizens and private sector organizations are looking beyond traditional remedies like additional roads and greater access to public transportation to reverse the negative impacts of increased road congestion. This year marks the first global Commuter Pain survey. IBM previously conducted the Commuter Pain survey in the United States in 2008 and 2009. IBM is actively working in the area of Smarter Transportation using a worldwide team of scientists, industry experts and IT services professionals to research, test and deploy new traffic information management capabilities in cities around the world. Findings from the Commuter Pain Survey will be used to assess citizen concerns about traffic and commuter issues; expand solutions like automated tolling, real-time traffic prediction, congestion charging, and intelligent route planning; and serve as a basis for pioneering innovative new approaches to traffic mitigation. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Commuting is considered one of life's least enjoyable activities, with cities such as Beijing, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Moscow, and New Delhi having the worst commutes in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index.

Movie title: The White Ribbon Movie plot: The action takes place in a German village in the fifteen months that precede World War I.Among the people who live there are a baron, who is a large landowner and a local moral authority, his estate manager, a pastor with his many children, a widowed doctor and a schoolteacher who is thinking of getting married. It is he who, many years later, tells this story.Though everything seems to be quiet and orderly, as it always has been, with the seasons following each other, and good harvests following bad ones, suddenly some strange events start to occur. If some appear to be quite ordinary, even accidental -- a farmer's wife dies falling through rotten floorboards -- others are inexplicable and may well be malevolent.Thus, a wire placed at knee-height has brought down the horse being ridden by the doctor, who is severely wounded.There's more of the same: an unknown hand opens a window to expose a newborn baby to the intense cold of the winter. A whole field of cabbages, on the baron's land, are beheaded with a scythe. One of the Baron's sons disappears: he is found his feet and hands bound, his buttocks lashed by a whip. A barn belonging to the manor is set on fire. A farmer hangs himself.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen. - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match. - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs. Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Q:I can use this background: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. Now, I have a new situation: In a doctor's office, two siblings both are having a small operation performed on their fingers in order to correct an identical injury. The movement of Joe's ions has been disrupted completely, but Emily's ions are still able to move normally. Answer this question please: Who will be more uncomfortable during the operation? A:","completion":"Emily will be more uncomfortable during the operation. Since Joe's ions movement has been disrupted completely, it means that the anesthetic has effectively numbed his affected area, blocking nerve impulses and preventing him from feeling pain during the operation. On the other hand, Emily's ions are still able to move normally, indicating that the anesthetic has not successfully numbed her affected area.

Given the question: Article: A dense wave of smog began in the Chinese city of Harbin and the surrounding Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning Provinces on 20 October 2013. Unseasonably warm temperatures with very little wind across northeastern China coincided with the smoke from local farmers' burning straws and the start-up of Harbin's coal-powered central heating system. Record densities of fine particulates were measured in the city. In Harbin, the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter) rise to 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, worse than Beijing's historic highs. Visibility was reduced to below 50m in parts of Harbin, and below 500m in most of the neighbouring Jilin Province. On Fa Yuen Street in Harbin, visibility of less than 5m was reported. The smog reduced after October 23, 2013 and completely broke up on October 28, 2013 by the first local snow and icy rain due to a cold front moving in from Russia. Harbin lies in the north of China where winter temperatures can drop to -40degC, demanding a six-month heating season. Daily particulate levels of more than 40 times the World Health Organization recommended maximum level were reported in parts of Harbin. The smog remained till 23 October, when almost all monitoring stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin,and Liaoning Provincesreported readings above 200mg/m3forPM2.5. PM2.5 is the amount of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter in the air, with the WHO recommending a maximum 24-hour mean of 25 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3). On the morning of 25 October, PM2.5 measurements in Harbin had fallen to an average of 123mg/m3. All highways in the surrounding Heilongjiang Province were closed.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views.

Write a title for this article: Last week’s Las Vegas shootings that left five dead, including two on-duty police officers, coincides with a nationwide increase of officers killed in 2014. According to the Nationwide Law Enforcement Memorial Foundation, 63 officers have died on the job this year compared to 45 at the same time last year -- a 40 percent increase. Twenty-three of those deaths were due to firearm-related incidents, a 53 percent increase from the same time last year. Previously, the overall number of officer fatalities had been on a steady decline since 2011. “We’ve had some good years and right now we’re in a bad one,” said Richard Beary, vice president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “In general, we’re seeing more violence in society and that violence in society leads to violence against police officers.” Beary, also the Chief of Police at the University of Central Florida, told FoxNews.com that central Florida is seeing an unusually violent year with two officers killed since February. “These officers had no idea somebody was going to kill cops and it’s a terrible situation and a tragedy,” Beary said. He added IACP is in favor of stronger background checks on people trying to purchase a gun. However, he acknowledged it is nearly impossible to predict or prevent officers’ deaths since many of the shooters have no respect for life. “One of the biggest challenges that all of us have is if somebody is set on taking their own life, they’re not afraid of taking another person's life,” Beary said. “I think that’s what we’re seeing in a lot of these cases, where they murder and then commit suicide.” That is exactly what happened earlier this week in Las Vegas, when Jerad and Amanda Miller shot and killed two Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officers in cold blood while they were on their lunch break. Igor Soldo and Alyn Beck were sitting in a pizza parlor when the shooters ambushed them. It was the first time in the department’s history that two officers were lost at the same time. The community is still coming to terms with their tragic deaths. This week, thousands attended a vigil to mourn the officers, who both leave behind wives and young children. The crowd gathered outside the restaurant where the officers were murdered. “They are some amazing people and to know they were intentionally gunned down, I’m having a hard time grasping it,” said Amber Ayers of Las Vegas.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. but i will be happy to leave . i will tattoo a maple leaf somewhere ( because my mother is always right ) and cry every wednesday night for months and happily embrace the turmoil of feeling shocked and displaced all over again ... in the one place that i want to stay forever , and the only place that will ever be home . so anyway , since i made myself really homesick and citysick with all of that thinking , i counted my pistachio mixer fund . Answer the following question: Why might I embrace the turmoil of being displaced ?","completion":"You might embrace the turmoil of being displaced due to various reasons. Here are some possible explanations: Step 1: Identifying potential benefits - Personal growth: Displacement often leads to new experiences and challenges which can help you grow as a person. Stepping out of your comfort zone and facing those challenges head-on will likely give you a sense of accomplishment and make you more resilient. - Cultural exposure: Experiencing other cultures can broaden your understanding and appreciation of the world. Displacement exposes you to diverse customs, values, and ways of life, which can be enriching and enlightening. - Strengthening relationships with loved ones: Being away from home might make you appreciate your relationships with your family and friends more. Such experiences can also bring families closer together, as they go through difficult times and support each other. - Self-discovery: Being displaced may provide you with the opportunity to discover more about yourself, your values, interests, and strengths. This can be done through introspection and reallocating your priorities. Step 2: Weighing potential drawbacks against benefits - Though displacement comes with discomfort and homesickness, there is a chance that embracing the challenges associated with it outweighs those drawbacks. Especially when considering the growth and development that could come from stepping out of one's comfort zone. Step 3: Acknowledging emotional attachment - Embracing the turmoil of displacement might also be a way of staying connected to the city and the people you consider home. The strong emotional attachment to the place you grew up could be a driving factor that helps you adapt, grow and reaffirm your dedication to that sole location. Step 4: Acceptance of mother's wisdom - As you mentioned that your mother is always right, this sentiment could factor into your willingness to embrace displacement and essentially \\"prove\\" her right by taking her suggested path. Step 5: Conclusion - You might embrace the turmoil of being displaced due to personal growth, cultural exposure, strengthening relationships with loved ones, self-discovery, emotional attachment, and acceptance of your mother's wisdom. These factors together potentially outweigh the discomfort of feeling homesick and could be the catalyst for embracing the challenges that come with displacement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the alias of the person who is ordered to attend the sniper course?, using the article: In 1989, Anthony \\"Swoff\\" Swofford, whose father served in the Vietnam War, attends U.S. Marine Corps training before being stationed at Camp Pendleton. Claiming that he joined the military because he \\"got lost on the way to college\\", Swofford finds his time at Camp Pendleton difficult, and struggles to make friends. While Swofford feigns illness to avoid his responsibilities, a \\"lifer\\", Staff Sergeant Sykes, takes note of his potential and orders Swofford to attend his Scout Sniper course. After grueling training, the Scout Sniper course is left with eight candidates, among them Swofford, now a sniper, and Swofford's roommate Corporal Alan Troy who becomes his spotter. When Iraq invades Kuwait, Swofford's unit is deployed to the Arabian Peninsula as a part of Operation Desert Shield. Eager for combat, the Marines find themselves bored with remedial training, constant drills, and a routine monotony that feeds their boredom, and prompts them to talk about the unfaithful girlfriends and wives waiting for them at home. They even erect a bulletin board featuring photographs and brief notes telling what perfidies the women had committed. Swofford obtains unauthorized alcohol and organizes an impromptu Christmas party, arranging for Fergus to cover his watch so he can celebrate. Fergus accidentally sets fire to a tent while cooking some sausages and ignites a crate of flares, waking the whole camp and enraging Staff Sergeant Sykes, who demotes Swofford from lance corporal to private and puts him on \\"shit-burning\\" detail. The punishments, combined with the heat, the boredom, and Swofford's suspicions of his girlfriend's infidelity, give Swofford a mental breakdown, to the point where he threatens Fergus with a rifle, then orders Fergus to shoot him instead., what would be the answer ?

Please write a short summary for the following article: Xbox Live Exec Talks Xbox One -- It's More Than A Game Console Xbox One comes out on Friday (image: Microsoft) The noise level at San Francisco’s Broadway Studios could best be described as cacophonic as dozens of gamers tested out Microsoft's Microsoft's new Xbox One on Sunday, six days ahead of its Friday launch. Microsoft was serving Mountain Dew and Doritos — the two main food groups for at least some gamers — to help fuel the excitement. And, amidst the gamers and tourists in the room was Microsoft Xbox Live programming chief Larry Hyrb. Dressed in business casual, he looked more like a business executive than a gaming maven, but he was treated like a rock star by admiring fans who asked him to pose with them in front of Microsoft’s giant Xbox 18-wheel truck parked at the venue. Scroll down to listen to 11-minute interview Xbox Live director of programming Larry Hyrb Hyrb described “the world 10 years ago” when Microsoft was finishing its design of Xbox 360, as “completely different technologically than it is now in terms of smart phones always connected, social media” and other differences that help shape the direction for Xbox One. But given the time between major console upgrades and the even more accelerated changes in technology, I wondered whether Microsoft, Sony Sony and Nintendo Nintendo can continue to wait years between major upgrades rather than at least annually, like PCs, phones, tables and major technology platforms. Hyrb said the the Xbox was “designed with multiple virtual machines so that we can actually do a lot of fancy upgrading with the exiting machine.” Also, of course, it’s connected with Xbox Live for cloud experiences and updates. He called it “tremendously flexible.” As per changes compared to the Xbox 360 — ”it’s certainly more powerful, the graphics are better but we tuned Xbox One for today’s gaming, meaning certainly high-def, certainly better sound but it’s also the fact that you can instantly resume a game — just like you can on a mobile phone. The system turns on in 13 seconds — completely unheard of 10 years ago.” Kinect built in — why that’s important Kinect – a camera and microphone and motion detector — is an add-on for the Xbox 360 but now built-into Xbox One, which means that developers can assume that every customer who uses a game developed for Xbox One will have access to this important peripheral. Hyrd said that Kinect is integrated at a “low level.” You can use your voice to say ” ‘Xbox On to turn on the system or Xbox Bing show me movies with George Clooney’” to see a list of his films you can watch immediately through the device. Thanks to high resolution tracking, “ the system can see your heart beating.” He said that it can actually see “the blood moving in your face,” which made me wonder about the possible medical uses of the device going forward. Hyrd said that it’s tremendously important to developers that Kinect is now bundled. “Instead of thinking ‘well gee maybe only 10% of the audience is going to see this particular feature of a game, now they’re guaranteed that every single person has Kinect and can therefore do really interesting things.” An example at launch is Dead Rising 3 that allows you to shout “hey come here” to summon zombies. He said that he’s seeing games where Kinect can sense the light in the room “so if it’s darker maybe you’ll see more zombies.” There was no Netflix Netflix streaming or HBO Go when the Xbox 360 was launched, but Xbox One is designed from the ground up to enable integration with both Internet and cable and satellite programming. He said that you can instantly switch not only between online programs but between streaming video, games and broadcast programming. He described the Xbox One as “the only next generation game console that has HDMI in, so that means it will work with your existing satellite or cable box.” You can use your voice not just for gaming and online video but to change cable channels. It’s also an infrared blaster so you can use it to mute the TV or adjust the volume. We’ve come a long way since the VCR flashing “12:00″ because people couldn’t figure out how to set the clock, let alone program. Xbox Live and platform integration Hyrb described Xbox Live as a “suite of services that’s gaming and entertainment.” He said, in addition to online multiplayer gaming, “we have Xbox music and movies and television, just like iTunes. Another feature, called “smart glass” turns your iOS, Android or Windows mobile device into a second screen, he said. “That enables experiences on games that bring it to that second screen.” One example is having “in game characters call you on your phone.” That could be creepy, especially if you get a call from a zombie. One interesting feature of Xbox live is that the system can learn about how people play games so that ”when you’re playing Forza Motor Sport 5, the system learns how you drive. So, if you have a friend you play with and he or she isn’t around, the system can still drive just like your friend would drive. “My drivator now is in your game,” he said. Listen to the 11 minute interview here Summary:","completion":"The Xbox One is a very special game console made by Microsoft. It has lots of cool features that make it more than just a toy for playing games. It's super fast, takes only 13 seconds to turn on, and has a special Kinect camera and microphone built-in that lets you control it with your voice and movements. It can even see your heart beating! It also works with your TV, so you can watch your favorite shows and movies. Plus, it can learn how you play games and connects with your phone or tablet for extra fun.

Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife. I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Cell Structure The cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells. Most protists are microscopic and unicellular, but some true multicellular forms exist. A few protists live as colonies that behave in some ways as a group of free-living cells and in other ways as a multicellular organism. Still other protists are composed of enormous, multinucleate, single cells that look like amorphous blobs of slime, or in other cases, like ferns. In fact, many protist cells are multinucleated; in some species, the nuclei are different sizes and have distinct roles in protist cell function. Single protist cells range in size from less than a micrometer to three meters in length to hectares. Protist cells may be enveloped by animal-like cell membranes or plant-like cell walls. Others are encased in glassy silica-based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips. The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion. Q: What functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion?

A:","completion":"To determine the category of the title \\"The Men Who Explained Miracles\\", I will begin by analyzing the keywords and their possible associations. Step 1: Analyzing keywords - \\"Men\\": Refers to a group of people, which suggests it could be related to a company, educational institution, artist, athlete, or office holder. - \\"Explained\\": Implies a communication or description of events or concepts, which could relate to an educational institution, artist, or written work. - \\"Miracles\\": Represents extraordinary events, often with religious or supernatural connotations. This may suggest a written work, film, or possibly an album. Step 2: Cross-checking keyword associations - By cross-referencing the possible connections, the title appears to have the strongest link to a written work, as it contains a subject (Men), action (Explained), and object (Miracles). Step 3: Confirming category - A brief search indicates that \\"The Men Who Explained Miracles\\" is indeed a collection of short stories written by John Dickson Carr, confirming its association with the \\"written work\\" category.

POST : Here is some well needed background infomation; me and my boyfriend at the time have been dating for 2 years near the end of our relationship i felt like we stopped texting alot and when i brought the issue up with him he would always brush it off, it came to a point where i sent him a playlist of chill beats with titles such as We dont talk anymore, lost in touch, ect. And other song titles like that. A part of the reason we brokw up is because we barley talked anymore(we go to the same school). We both agreed we would be friends thought. Since september of last year till a few days ago i have been ignoring my ex boyfriend because he doesnt text me, he said that everything was cool between us but to me there wasnt. I would tell him and he would say everything is fine, i would talk to him in the halls but he would ignore me and i would shoot him a text and he would just see it and not replay for hours later but i would see he had been online at or a few momments before.

Options are: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","completion":"The statement provided indicates that Dublin celebrated its millennium as a city in 1988. This means that the year 1988 marked 1000 years since Dublin was established as a city. To evaluate the hypothesis, \\"Dublin is a relatively young city\\" based on this information, we first need to define what \\"relatively young\\" might mean in this context. Generally, the term \\"relatively\\" is a comparison term which implies comparing with other similar entities. In this case, it's comparing Dublin with other cities. The age of any city is considered based on when it was officially established or inhabited. Cities with a history of 1000 years or more are usually considered old because they have survived for a millennium, which is a significant amount of time in human history. Thus, defining \\"young\\" and \\"old\\" for a city generally depends on the context. But if we go by generally accepted standards, 1000 years for a city to exist wouldn't fall under the category of \\"young\\". Considering the information provided earlier \\"Erected in 1988 to celebrate Dublin's millennium as a city...\\", It clearly indicates that Dublin was celebrating its millennium, which means it had existed for 1000 years from 1988. This suggests that Dublin is at least a thousand years old as of 1988. Therefore, considering all these facts, we can conclude that the city of Dublin isn't relatively young.

They get to know each other and begin dating. The relationship fizzles out when Charles travels overseas to join the Royal Navy in early 1973. Camilla immediately marries her ex-boyfriend Andrew Parker Bowles. Though Charles is hurt upon hearing about her marriage, they remain friends. Throughout their friendship Charles and Camilla hide their feelings for each other until 1979 when Lord Mountbatten is murdered and Charles visits her more for emotional support. They re-ignite their romantic relationship during this period. Charles is now in his early 30s and his family and the British media begins calling him out to find a suitable bride.

Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in Blender likened it to a poorly-constructed building. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\".

Adult contemporary music: Mainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional AC artists like Barbra Streisand, the Carpenters, Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow, John Denver, and Olivia Newton-John found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the Contemporary Hit Radio format, such as Richard Marx, Michael Jackson, Bonnie Tyler, George Michael, Phil Collins, and Laura Branigan began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency. Collins has been described by AllMusic as \\"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\\".

Defeated and stranded due to the damage to his car, Ben reports to the local clinic, where Nurse Packer further humbles him by recording his community service hours by clocking him in and out, like a factory worker. Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car.

Background: Frederick Carlton \\"Carl\\" Lewis (born July 1, 1961) is an American former track and field athlete who won nine Olympic gold medals, one Olympic silver medal, and 10 World Championships medals, including eight gold. His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only three Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games. Lewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the 100 m, 200 m and long jump events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. Context: Frederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927-1987) and Evelyn nee Lawler Lewis. His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team. His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both Carl and his sister Carol. She became an elite long jumper, finishing 9th at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships. Lewis was initially coached by his father, who also coached other local athletes to elite status. At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at Willingboro High School in his hometown of Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers. Many colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the University of Houston where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis' coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in). By the end of 1979, Lewis was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to Track and Field News. An old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and this might have had consequences on his fitness. Lewis worked with Tellez and adapted his technique so that he was able to jump without pain, and he went on to win the 1980 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of 8.35 m (27 ft 4 1/2 in). Though his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with Jesse Owens, who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s.

A: A:","completion":"Erythrocytes, also known as red blood cells (RBCs), are the most abundant formed elements in the blood and play a crucial role in oxygen transport throughout the body. These red, biconcave disks are packed with an oxygen-carrying compound called hemoglobin, which is responsible for their unique function and gives them their characteristic color. Hemoglobin is a complex protein molecule composed of four polypeptide chains and four iron-containing heme groups. Each heme group binds to one oxygen molecule, enabling a single hemoglobin molecule to carry up to four molecules of oxygen. When oxygen binds to the iron atom within the heme group, the process is referred to as oxygenation, resulting in the formation of oxyhemoglobin. This bond is reversible, allowing hemoglobin to pick up oxygen in the lungs and then release it to the tissues as needed. The structure of erythrocytes, as well as their high hemoglobin content, allows for efficient oxygen transport. The biconcave disk shape provides an increased surface area to volume ratio, which maximizes the efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the RBCs and their surroundings. Moreover, the flexibility of erythrocytes is another key feature that allows them to traverse through the smallest blood vessels, known as capillaries, to deliver oxygen to tissues and organs. Erythrocytes do not have a nucleus or many of the organelles typically found in other cells. This absence of cellular components creates additional space for carrying a higher volume of hemoglobin and thus more oxygen. Erythrocytes are also designed to have a relatively short lifespan (approximately 120 days) to ensure a continuous supply of fresh, functional cells to replace aged and damaged counterparts. The spleen and liver are primarily responsible for the disposal and recycling of old erythrocytes. In addition to oxygen transportation, erythrocytes also contribute to the maintenance of acid-base balance in the blood by functioning as a buffer system. Hemoglobin can bind to carbon dioxide (a waste product of cellular metabolism) in a process called carbamino formation, producing carbaminohemoglobin. This reaction not only helps remove carbon dioxide from the tissues but also aids in the regulation of blood pH levels. In conclusion, erythrocytes are vital components of blood that not only give blood its red color but are crucial for oxygen transport throughout the body. Their unique red, biconcave disk shape and the presence of hemoglobin allow them to efficiently deliver oxygen to tissues and organs while maintaining acid-base balance and pH regulation within the circulatory system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. New McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook unveiled a turnaround plan for the struggling fast food giant Monday morning. And he did not mince words when discussing the company's problems. He said that the recent performance was \\"poor\\" and that \\"the numbers don't lie.\\" Sales have fallen lately and the stock has lagged the broader market. To tackle this problem, McDonald's is reorganizing its international operations and plans to franchise more of its restaurants. It wants to have 90% of its locations franchised by 2018, up from 81% currently. McDonald's hopes to save 300 million annually by the end of 2017 thanks to all the restructuring and plans to be more disciplined about spending. But what Easterbrook really wants to change is the quality of the food and stale brand image. Get ready for more new offerings like its sirloin burger and artisan grilled chicken sandwich. The company also is testing beef and chicken sandwiches with flavors such as pico guacamole and jalapeno. Related: McDonald's is giving 90,000 workers a raise McDonald's (MCD) faces tough competition from rapidly growing burger chains like Shake Shack (SHAK), Five Guys and Smashburger that are increasingly popular with younger customers. Many consumers feel that burgers from these and other chains, despite being more expensive, taste better and are made from higher quality ingredients. Consumers are also embracing so-called fast casual food from Chipotle (CMG) (which McDonald's used to own a stake in) and Panera (PNRA). Related: Chipotle is now GMO-free And there is a full blown breakfast war in fast food as well. Yum Brands (YUM)-owned Taco Bell is gunning for the Egg McMuffin crowd. Is the plan enough? Investors don't seem convinced. The stock fell Monday. Easterbrook stressed that McDonald's has to innovate more. He promised that the company would return \\"excitement\\" to the brand and used the phrase \\"modern, progressive burger company\\" several times to describe the image McDonald's wants to convey. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to the food. No amount of restructuring can help if the company doesn't make tasty burgers and fries. \\"It is customers that decide if we succeed. The message is clear. We are not on our game,\\" he said. During a conference call with reporters, Easterbrook said there is \\"enthusiastic testing\\" about new menu items and changes to how customers order. On the menu side, Easterbrook said the company is experimenting with new TasteCrafted sandwiches in some California locations. Customers can choose a beef or chicken patty on one of three types of rolls and four different flavors. Easterbrook said McDonald's may also soon feature mobile ordering, self-order kiosks or other types of technology so customers won't just be forced to go to the counter or drive-through window. \\"We are adding choice, whether it's on service or the menu for our customers,\\" he said. Still, it remains to be seen how any of this will work. One issue that Easterbrook is trying to tackle is the complexity of the menu. There are too many offerings. Customization may be something consumers want. But it could also make the ordering process even more complicated. ||||| McDonald's is reorganizing its business, selling restaurants to franchisees and giving billions back to shareholders as part of a much-anticipated turnaround plan unveiled by the company's new CEO. Many industry observers had hoped to see the struggling burger giant take more risks on matters that customers care about: menu choices, food quality and speed. \\"Everything that he talked about seemed sensible but it seems to lack that calculated risk that they talked about on the last earnings call,\\" said R.J. Hottovy, who follows restaurant companies at Morningstar. \\"I don't look at anything they've discussed today as truly groundbreaking, and more of just catching up with a lot of things their peers have done.\\" Caption TRIBUNE TRIBUNE See more galleries Caption Market segments See more galleries Related Galleries RESTART GALLERY The changes unveiled Monday, just nine weeks into CEO Steve Easterbrook's tenure, were largely behind-the-scenes efforts aimed at keeping investors happy while buying the company time to fix its menu, long a source of frustration for diners and franchisees. McDonald's, which cut dozens of jobs at its Oak Brook headquarters in recent months, did not say how many additional jobs it might eliminate. Increasingly, millennials and other consumers are bypassing McDonald's in favor of fast-growing competitors such as Chipotle, Panera Bread and Shake Shack that serve foods perceived as premium, fresher or healthier. \\"No business or brand has a divine right to succeed,\\" Easterbrook said near the start of a 23-minute video released Monday outlining some of the goals. \\"The reality is our recent performance has been poor. The numbers don't lie.\\" Comparable sales, or sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, have fallen globally in four consecutive quarters and are down six straight quarters in the United States, with no sign of quick rebounds. The CEO was frank in his assessment and said he expects pressures to persist through at least the first half of 2015. Easterbrook, who aims to turn McDonald's into \\"a modern, progressive burger company,\\" said the company has \\"scale and reach like no other company,\\" yet has become cumbersome and slow. \\"We're not on our game,\\" Easterbrook said. There were few new details Monday on changes consumers will notice, though the CEO mentioned U.S. efforts such as artisan grilled chicken and sirloin burgers and an emphasis on value to come this summer. Easterbrook also pulled back from his predecessor Don Thompson's lofty expectations for Create Your Taste order kiosks. Thompson had predicted the kiosks, which allow customers to choose everything from guacamole to garlic sauce, would show up at 2,000 U.S. restaurants by the end of 2015, up from 30. Instead, Easterbrook emphasized the opportunity the U.S. could have with TasteCrafted, which lets diner choose from several predetermined topping combinations. He also announced McDonald's is testing delivery from 88 restaurants in New York City through Postmates, a service that already delivers for chains such as Chipotle and Starbucks. McDonald's plans to sell some 3,500 company-owned restaurants to franchisees restaurants by the end of 2018, up from a prior target of refranchising at least 1,500 restaurants by 2016. The new plan means that it will have about 90 percent of its restaurants run by franchisees, up from 81 percent currently. Having fewer company-run restaurants frees the corporation to spend more time on branding and other overall efforts rather than being as concerned with day-to-day operations at individual stores. It also shifts some risk to franchisees, who pay percentages of their sales to McDonald's. Plus, it would trim the number of restaurant workers directly employed by McDonald's even as the company plans to increase starting wages at the U.S. restaurants it operates, bowing to growing union pressures under the Fight for 15 banner. The company announced a new structure with four segments: The U.S. and three international segments. Starting July 1, the new segments will be run by existing McDonald's executives. Mike Andres will continue to serve as president of the U.S. business, a role he took on last fall. Doug Goare, who is president of McDonald's Europe, will become president of International Lead Markets, a group of well-established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K. The U.S. market accounts for more than 40 percent of McDonald's operating income, followed by International Lead Markets, which accounts for about 40 percent of operating income. High-growth markets, including China and Russia, and foundational markets, including countries such as South Africa, each account for about 10 percent of operating income. McDonald's said the refranchising, organizational shake-up and being more disciplined about spending should cut costs by about 300 million a year. Much of the savings should be realized by the end of 2017. McDonald's also plans to return 8 billion to 9 billion to shareholders this year and aims to reach the top end of its goal to return 18 billion to 20 billion to shareholders from 2014 to 2016. Howard Penney, a restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management in Connecticut, said Monday's announcement left him feeling unsatisfied. He said refranchising and stock buybacks were not a big deal because McDonald's generates a lot of cash. \\"We were not given a lot of detail about how he is going to fix the operations,\\" Penney said. \\"Shuffling the decks inside the organization is not a strategy.\\" Standard & Poor's lowered its ratings on McDonald's to A- from A and said the outlook is stable. McDonald's said it would issue more debt, taking advantage of low interest rates, to help fund its efforts. So far this year, McDonald's has overhauled everything from its ingredients to its employee compensation to its advertising as it tries to boost sales around the world. McDonald's issues include a long string of sales declines amid fresh competition from fast-casual chains such as Chipotle. It faces economic pressure in major markets such as Europe as well as union-backed protests as some workers seek higher wages and improved working conditions. On Monday, the union-backed Fight for 15 group said thousands of cooks and cashiers would participate in what it said would be the biggest protest ever to hit McDonald's annual shareholder meeting, set for May 21 at its Oak Brook campus. Sriram Madhusoodanan from Corporate Accountability International, which speaks out against McDonald's marketing efforts, meanwhile said he saw \\"no substantive plan\\" from Easterbrook on how he plans to address the brand's lost trust and credibility. McDonald's has said it expects its sales weakness to continue in the near term. It already forecast a decline in global comparable sales for April. The April sales results are due Friday. ||||| S&P downgraded fast food giant McDonald's credit rating to \\"A-\\" with a stable outlook on Monday. \\"The return to shareholders of about 8.5 billion this year will necessitate higher leverage than we forecast and represents a more aggressive shift toward shareholders returns than we previously assumed,\\" according to a release. As part of McDonald's plan to turnaround its business, the fast food giant plans to accelerate refranchising and overhaul its organizational structure to juice company results and modernize the fast food giant's struggling operations, CEO Steve Easterbook said Monday. McDonald's plans to increase its franchise mix to 90 percent of its locations by 2018 from the current 81 percent as the company embarks on an \\"urgent need to reset this business,\\" Easterbrook said in a video Monday, warning that progress will be \\"bumpy and uneven.\\" The restaurant is also reorganizing its structure into four segments: U.S., international lead markets, high growth markets and foundational markets. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, unveiled a turnaround plan to tackle the company's recent performance, which he described as \\"poor\\".

Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, under fierce attack for his plan to boost income taxes and for his handling of a prison release program, finds himself in a dead heat against surging state Comptroller Dan Hynes. State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, the Democratic front-runner in the race for President Barack Obama’s old Senate seat, has seen his lead in polls narrow in recent days as he has taken criticism from former Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman and Chicago Urban League President Cheryle Jackson about his oversight of a family-owned bank and his handling of the Bright Start college savings program. At the local level, Todd Stroger, the powerful Democratic president of the Cook County Board, who has come under fire for his hiring practices and his support for a sales tax increase, has fallen significantly behind his primary challengers in new polling. “Democrats are starting to realize that every single Democrat in the country is vulnerable now. It’s a very angry electorate, a very volatile electorate,” said Jerry Morrison, political director of the state Service Employees International Union, which has endorsed Quinn and Giannoulias. “It’s been brewing for some time,” said Illinois House Republican Leader Tom Cross. “I think it’s as intense here as it’s been [in Massachusetts].” As in Massachusetts, where Republican Scott Brown recently won a stunning Senate victory, polling shows Illinois voters expressing deep dissatisfaction with the direction of the state and the country, with a survey late last year from the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute showing that just 23 percent of voters think the state is headed in the right direction and that just 44 percent think the country is headed in the right direction. That sentiment confronts not only the Democrats caught in competitive primaries but also Rep. Mark Kirk, the front-runner for the Republican Senate nomination. “The anger is palpable. People are frustrated — and they don’t know who to take it out on,” said Eric Adelstein, an Illinois-based Democratic strategist. “[People are] just very cynical — and right now the job approvals are low for everybody.” But for all the comparisons with the Massachusetts race — a nationalized affair that focused heavily on the health care debate — the Illinois contests remain distinctly state-focused, with both parties’ contenders for governor and Senate homing in on corruption in the state capital and a devastating state budget deficit that now tops 11 billion. Steve Brown, a senior aide to Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, predicted that voters Tuesday would base their decisions on how they saw lawmakers addressing the state’s problems. “It’s a different situation than you have in other states,” said Brown. “I think [voters] are more focused on the performance of individual legislators.” All of this takes place against the backdrop of the scandal involving former Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who, a little more than a year ago, was impeached after charges that he sought to sell Obama’s Senate seat to the highest bidder. “For far too long, Illinois has been ruled by the hair,” says an ad for gubernatorial contender Andy McKenna, a former state GOP chairman, showing a Blagojevich-like mop of hair covering the dome of the state Capitol. “The cure must come from the outside.” ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Widespread voter anger and unrest are confronting the Illinois political establishment as the state approaches its first-in-the-nation primaries.

One day, as Mary was picking the blueberries, she turned around to find that Max was not there. She became worried and ran off to look for her dog. She looked in all of their favorite spots...next to the stream, in their secret hiding place behind the raspberry bushes, and even inside the old cabin that sat in the woods. But poor Max was nowhere to be found. Nonetheless, Mary would not give up. She kept looking and she found him not very far away. He had seen a squirrel and run to chase it. When Mary called Max's name he left the squirrel and happily returned to Mary, wagging his tail as he went.

You don't want to use your personal account since the sender will be able to view your personal information (name, e-mail address, etc. ). Can we infer the following? An email can reveal personal information if you aren't careful. Choose from: (1). Yes. (2). It's impossible to say. (3). No. The answer is:","completion":"(1). Yes. It is accurate to infer that an email can reveal personal information if you aren't careful. When you send an email using your personal email account, it usually contains your name, email address, and sometimes even additional contact information, depending on how you have set up your email signature. This data can be easily accessed by the recipient of the email, making it less secure when you want to send messages anonymously. To send an anonymous text or message, it is necessary to take some precautions that help conceal your identity so that the recipient cannot trace the message back to you. Here are some steps to help you send an anonymous text: 1. Create a new, anonymous email account: There are numerous email providers such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook that offer free email accounts. Set up a new account that does not include any of your personal information. Make sure not to use your real name or any identifying details when choosing your username and email address for this account. 2. Use an anonymous texting app or website: There are several apps and online platforms that allow you to send anonymous texts, like Textem, TextForFree, and Text'em. These services typically don't require you to provide any personal information, and the recipient will not be able to view your identity. Be mindful of the app's privacy policy and terms of service, as some may store your messages or share them with third parties. 3. Enable a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) helps to protect your privacy and anonymity by hiding your true IP address. This will make it more difficult for the recipient, or anyone else, to trace the text message back to you. There are both free and paid VPN options available, so choose one that meets your needs and ensures a secure connection. 4. Be cautious with the content of your message: While these steps can help you maintain anonymity, it's essential to be aware of the content you share in your anonymous text. Refrain from including personal, identifiable information that could compromise your anonymity. Also, note that sending threatening, harassing, or illegal messages can lead to legal consequences, even if you are attempting to stay anonymous. By following these measures, you can minimize the risk of revealing your personal information when sending an anonymous text. Always be cautious and respectful in your actions, as anonymity does not shield you from potential consequences related to inappropriate or harmful messages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: They only offer upscale rooms at a premium price. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise states that they have rooms and houses to fit many tastes and budgets, from the lavish to the thrifty. This means that they offer a diverse range of accommodations, including both high-end, luxurious options and more budget-friendly, economical choices. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise since it claims that they only offer upscale rooms at a premium price. To offer a more detailed explanation, let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze the discrepancies between them. Premise: 1. They offer rooms and houses to accommodate various tastes and budgets. 2. They provide a range of options, from the lavish to the thrifty. Hypothesis: 1. They only offer upscale rooms. 2. These rooms come at a premium price. In the premise, it is clearly indicated that there is a range of accommodations to suit different preferences and financial constraints. The company or service in question aims to cater to a wide audience by providing options across a spectrum of luxury and affordability. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the company exclusively offers upscale rooms at premium prices. This assumes that only luxurious and expensive accommodations are available, which contradicts the premise's claim that they cater to various tastes and budgets. According to the premise, options from different levels of luxury and price ranges should be accessible, while the hypothesis excludes the presence of more affordable and less luxurious rooms. In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis are in conflict, and it is not possible to deduce that the hypothesis is true if the premise is accurate. They present two opposite scenarios: one with a diverse range of accommodations, and the other with only a specific type of luxurious rooms. As a result, accepting the premise as true would invalidate the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this \\"A University of Nottingham lecturer who criticised the arrest of a student under the Terrorism Act has left his job \\"by mutual agreement\\".\\"","completion":"Title: Lecturer Exits University of Nottingham Amidst Dispute Over Student's Terrorism Act Arrest Introduction A lecturer from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom has recently left his job by mutual agreement, following disagreement over the arrest of a university student under the Terrorism Act. The lecturer's criticism of the arrest raised questions on the issue of academic freedom and how universities handle national security concerns. Step 1: Explain the background of the incident The incident began when a University of Nottingham student was arrested on campus under the Terrorism Act, a piece of legislation that gives law enforcement additional powers when dealing with terrorism-related offenses. The student was suspected of being involved in activities that led the authorities to believe they posed a threat to national security. Step 2: Introduce the lecturer's stance As news of the arrest became public, the unnamed lecturer criticized the university's role in the arrest and questioned the legitimacy of the Terrorism Act being applied to the student. These criticisms were heard and discussed throughout the academic community at the university and beyond. Step 3: Present the university's response to the criticism In response to the lecturer's criticism, the University of Nottingham expressed concern over the severity of the issue and claimed to have fully cooperated with law enforcement to protect their students, staff, and broader community. Additionally, the university emphasized the importance of adhering to national security guidelines and the role they play in upholding these standards. Step 4: Discuss the lecturer's departure As the situation escalated, the lecturer and the University of Nottingham reached a mutual agreement for the lecturer to leave his position at the university. The specific reasons for the departure have not been disclosed, but the decision has led to a wider conversation about academic freedom and the responsibilities of educational institutions when dealing with national security concerns. Step 5: Analyze the implications of this incident The departure of this lecturer from the University of Nottingham has brought attention to several critical questions related to the relationship between academic freedom and national security. Educational institutions are often faced with the dilemma of balancing their dedication to fostering open discussion and research, with the legal responsibility to protect their communities from potential threats. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of academic freedom in a democratic society, as well as the need for universities to be vigilant and responsive to security concerns. It highlights the fundamental and ongoing debate about the role of universities in contemporary society, and whether the pursuit of knowledge should occasionally be curtailed in the name of security. Conclusion As we reflect on the departure of the University of Nottingham lecturer, we are reminded of the delicate balance between academic freedom and national security responsibilities. This case offers a glimpse into the complexities that educational institutions face in today's increasingly interconnected world. It invites us to ponder on the role of universities in shaping our societies and safeguarding academic freedom while respecting the need for national security measures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This sentence suggests an ongoing issue or problem in a certain Commission. The issue highlighted here is the lack of transparency. Transparency, in this context, refers to openness, accountability, and honesty in the Commission's operations. When an organization or sector is transparent, it is easy for others, including citizens, to see what actions are performed within that organization/sector. The speaker’s remarks reveal that not only does this lack of transparency exist, but it is also recognized and potentially criticized by citizens. There is a continuous reference to the problem, suggesting that it hasn't been adequately addressed or solved yet, hence it is still being mentioned and it remains a significant issue. The public, or \\"the citizens\\", have an opinion on this matter that seems to contribute to its significance. The phrase \\"the citizens' opinion on this matter\\" implies that public sentiment or opinion may be unhappy with or critical of the existing state of transparency within the Commission. Therefore, the speaker seems to be suggesting that more work needs to be done to improve transparency and to address public concerns about it in the Commission. Notably, this sentence does not provide details about the specific Commission, so it's impossible to discuss the particular implications or reasons for this lack of transparency. However, in general, lack of transparency in any organization or body could lead to various problems, including decreased trust, accountability issues, and inefficient operations among others.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: More than nuclear bomb tests, the suicide of former South Korean president Roh Moo-Hyun has stunned the South Korean public. While the news has shocked the nation, perhaps the level of surprise at the method wasn't as great. The suicide of former president Roh has shocked South Korea. In a country with one of the highest suicide rates among economically advanced countries, traditional concepts of honor and public \\"face\\" remain powerful social forces. According to World Health Organization figures, rates of suicide in South Korea doubled to 21.9 deaths per 100,000 people between 1996 and 2006. The United Nations cites that 90 percent of suicide cases were caused by mental disorders, but socio-cultural and economic pressures play a large part. While each case of suicide has a number of complex personal issues, the connection between suicide and honor has a historical basis in many Asian countries. \\"There are cultural histories in Asian societies of honorable suicide, such as hara-kiri in Japan, where the person assumes total responsibility,\\" said Dr. Erminia Colucci, research fellow at the University of Melbourne's School of Population Health. \\"In many western countries, a suicide in someone of Roh's position might be more about looking for understanding. In collectivist societies, like Japan and Korea, where a person's identity is more tied closely to other groups, suicides can be seen as the ultimate way to rebuild or reclean your image, if it changes.\\" \\"I think there is something paradoxical in it. On one hand, some see it as a way of maintaining status and restoring honor to you and the people you represent, but the pressure from that group could contribute to you considering suicide.\\" Roh was under investigation for corruption and some believe the pressures he felt just became too great. \\"Roh had come to power as a human rights lawyer, as an uneducated outsider pledging to clean up Korean politics, so it was particularly hard on him to have what he stood for and the reality of what happened under his administration. I think that was particularly hard for him to take,\\" David King, director of the Korean Studies Institute at the University of Southern California told CNN. Watch more on the rise and fall of Roh. In a suicide note to his family, Roh described his life as \\"difficult\\" and was sorry for making \\"too many people suffer.\\" Roh had said he was ashamed about the scandal and in the first round of questioning, he said he was losing face and that he was disappointing his supporters. In South Korea, Roh is the latest and highest profile of recent suicides of public figures. In late 2008, two South Korean actors took their lives. Police cited malicious online rumors as a possible cause for the suicide of Cho Jin-sil in October 2008. The blogs and chat rooms had speculated that she had been pressuring fellow actor Ahn Jae-hwan to repay a debt before he took his own life in September 2008. Video: How South Korean continue mourning ». High-profile suicides can make for lurid headlines, which Dr Paul Yip, director of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, believes are far from helpful in combating suicide rates. \\"Common in Asia is to sensationalize suicides, especially among celebrities. Often the local or national media publish lots of details of how it was done. The media (in Hong Kong) has got better in their responsible reporting,\\" he said. \\"Whenever famous people kill themselves there is an effect on those people who are most vulnerable from a similar age group -- we see this in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan and China, \\" said Yip. \\"People at risk can see Roh's death as an example and say, 'Well if he can do it, so can I'. Neither Roh nor any of the high-profile people who have committed suicide would have thought about this affect. There are a number of complex issues. There isn't just one that leads someone to take their life.\\" Copycat deaths are a worry for Yip, and Colucci agreed that there can be lots of meaning in the method of a suicide, which people may be encouraged to follow. \\"The way that Roh died is similar to some of the methods used in Japan, which is interesting. It really suggests it's about the people wanting to relieve the burden they feel they are on others. For young people, it can be really connected to ideas of identity. For many, they feel it's the last thing they have control over,\\" said Colucci. Watch CNN's report on Japan's suicide forest. Yip advised the South Korean Ministry of Health during Roh's administration to help them devise a new approach to dealing with mental health issues and the problem of suicide. \\"It is sad that Roh, whose government really did a lot to tackle the issue, should have done this. Last year a mental health act was passed by the South Korean government, as it recognized that more steps needed to be taken,\\" said Yip. While there are distinct differences between the societies and traditions of Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, Yip was at least encouraged that the Chinese Special Administrative Region has seen a decline in the number of suicide cases since its peak in 2003 of some 1,200 to around 9000 . A key element has been breaking though the taboo of talking about mental health issues, one that Yip believed was common across Asia. \\"They've been stigmatized, and very common that it would not be talked about, especially if there is not a good mental health support system in place. Ten years ago in Hong Kong, people didn't want to talk about it.\\" However, Yip is well aware of the link between suicide rates and economic change, which many have cited as a reason for suicide rates increasing. \\"The rate generally goes up more in Asian countries than the west when there is an economic downturn. For an age group like Roh's, suicide can seem like a very traditional, if extreme way to solve problems. The problems at first are economic, but make people feel great shame or disgrace. There is a large sense of pride in middle-age men and working people.\\" Making it acceptable to talk about problems, making people feel connected to their community and having a support system in place were methods Yip believed has helped to reduce those at risk. But it was not just something that charities or governments can work on, Yip said: \\"We have to reach out to the main concern groups, it's a multi-layered approach.\\" Highlights:","completion":"1.

It has been a great threat for the poultry industry all around the world. In this report, we successfully produced infectious pseudotyped pNL4-3-Luc-R 2 E 2 (HIV-Luc) viruses with the HN and F envelope proteins of NDV. Further investigation revealed the cytoplasmic domains of HN and F, especially HN, plays a significant role in the infection efficiency of these pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. Replacement of, or direct fusion to the cytoplasmic domain of the HN protein by that of vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) could greatly enhance or destroy the infective potential of HN and F-pseudotyped (NDVpseudotyped) HIV-Luc virus. We further established a novel neutralization assay to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against NDV with the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. Comparative neutralization data indicate that the results determined by using the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses are as reliable as those by the conventional virus-neutralization assay (VN test) with native NDV. Moreover, the results show that the novel neutralization assay is more sensitive than the VN test.

Voters in two major California cities overwhelmingly approved cuts to retirement benefits for city workers in what supporters said was a mandate that may lead to similar ballot initiatives in other states and cities that are struggling with mounting pension obligations. Supporters had a simple message to voters in San Diego and San Jose: Pensions for city workers are unaffordable and more generous than many private companies offer, forcing libraries to slash hours and potholes to go unfilled. \\"The public is frustrated,\\" said San Diego Councilman Carl DeMaio, a Republican who staked his mayoral bid on the pension measure and advanced to a November runoff in Tuesday's election to lead the nation's eighth-largest city. In San Diego, 66 percent voted in favor of Proposition B, while 34 percent were opposed. Nearly 97 percent of precincts were tallied by early Wednesday. The landslide was even bigger in San Jose, the nation's 10th-largest city. With all precincts counted, 70 percent were in favor of Measure B and 30 percent were opposed. \\"The voters get it, they understand what needs to be done,\\" said San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed, a Democrat who has called pensions his highest priority. Shrinking tax revenues during the recession are also responsible for service cuts in San Diego and San Jose, but pensions were an easy target. San Diego's payments to the city's retirement fund soared from 43 million in 1999 to 231.2 million this year, equal to 20 percent of the city's general fund budget, which pays for day-to-day operations. As the pension payments grew, San Diego's 1.3 million residents saw roads deteriorate and libraries and recreation centers cut hours. For a while, some fire stations had to share engines and trucks. The city has cut its workforce 14 percent to 10,100 employees since Sanders took office in 2005. San Jose's pension payments jumped from 73 million in 2001 to 245 million this year, equal to 27 percent of its general fund budget. Voters there approved construction bonds at the beginning of the last decade, but four new libraries and a police station have never opened because the city cannot afford to operate them. The city of 960,000 cut its workforce 27 percent to 5,400 over the last 10 years. Tuesday's votes set the stage for potentially lengthy legal challenges by public employee unions. The measures are unusual because they address pensions for current employees, not just new hires. Opponents say the measures deprive workers of benefits they were counting on when they got hired. Some workers decided against potentially more lucrative jobs with private companies, figuring their retirement was relatively safe. Those arguments failed to resonate with voters. \\"A lot of employees are disheartened,\\" said Yolanda Cruz, president of the San Jose Municipal Employees Federation, who called the outcome disappointing. \\"We've been made the full problem of what's been going on.\\" The ballot measures differ on specifics. San Diego's imposes a six-year freeze on pay levels used to determine pension benefits unless a two-thirds majority of the City Council votes to override it. It also puts new hires, except for police officers, into 401(k)-style plans. More than 100,000 residents signed petitions to put the San Diego measure on the ballot. Under San Jose's measure, current workers have to pay up to 16 percent of their salaries to keep their retirement plan or accept more modest benefits. New hires would get less generous benefits. Reed joined an 8-3 City Council majority to put the measure on the ballot. He said after Tuesday's vote that he expected other cities in financial binds to pursue similar measures. \\"It's novel but it's certainly not radical,\\" he said. \\"Mayors across the country are very interested. We're at the leading edge but we're not alone.\\" ||||| LOS ANGELES — As Wisconsin residents voted on Tuesday not to recall Gov. Scott Walker — who has become an enemy of labor unions nationwide — two California cities dealt blows of their own to organized labor. In San Diego and San Jose, voters overwhelmingly approved ballot initiatives designed to help balance ailing municipal budgets by cutting retirement benefits for city workers. Around 70 percent of San Jose voters favored the pension measure, while 66 percent of San Diego residents supported a similar measure. \\"This is really important to our taxpayers,\\" Mayor Chuck Reed of San Jose, said Tuesday night. \\"We’ll get control over these skyrocketing retirement costs and be able to provide the services they are paying for.\\" Statewide, voters also remained very closely divided on a 1-per-pack tax on cigarettes, which would be the first increase in the cigarette tax here in 14 years. Proceeds from the tax would not go to state coffers, but would instead finance cancer research. The tax remained too close to call on Wednesday morning, according to The Associated Press, although opponents of the measure appeared to cling to a razor-thin lead with all precincts reporting. Antismoking advocates, who promoted the tax as the best way to reduce smoking rates, were outspent nearly four to one. Their opponents, financed largely by the tobacco industry, spent almost 47 million in advertisements to defeat the measure. Public employee unions, meanwhile, had fought hard against the two pension reform initiatives. The San Diego Municipal Employees Association brought an unsuccessful legal challenge in an effort to keep the measure off the ballot, and union leaders said they would continue to challenge the new pension plan in court. The measure in San Jose will probably face a legal challenge as well. Michael Zucchet, general manager of the union, said that it had already negotiated pension reforms with the city, and that the plan imposed by the ballot initiative would not save San Diego money. Its proponents, he said, were motivated largely by politics. “This initiative, in and of itself, saves not one penny,” Mr. Zucchet said. But the mayors of both cities pushed the pension reforms hard, arguing that changes to city worker pensions were essential to keep municipal budgets in the black. Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said he hoped the initiatives would provide models for other cities and for the state government, where pension reform efforts have stalled. \\"The appetite for pension reform in California is huge,\\" Mr. Coupal said. Tuesday also offered the first widespread test of the state’s new primary system, in which the top two vote-getters move on to a runoff, regardless of party affiliation. One of the most heavily financed races pit two sitting Democratic representatives, colleagues in the House for 15 years, against each other to represent the San Fernando Valley: Brad Sherman won with 42 percent of the vote, and Howard L. Berman had 32 percent. They will face each other again in the November runoff. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"In a move that signals a broader shift in addressing increasing pension obligations, voters in two major Californian cities, San Diego and San Jose, have overwhelmingly approved cuts to city workers' retirement benefits.

The relationship between the terms is that Woody Allen is a part of the larger group of Jews. Step 3: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis. The premise states there is pride in Jews as a whole. This implies that Jews, in general, have a sense of pride. Since Woody Allen is a Jew, he is a part of this group.

If it is true that pride exists in Jews as a whole, it is possible that Woody Allen, being an influential Jew, may also possess pride.

Does \\"Rome's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own.\\" correctly answer the question of Who ate the meat of the sacrifice during the after sacrifice banquet?","completion":"The statement \\"Rome's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own\\" partially answers the question of who ate the meat of the sacrifice during the after-sacrifice banquet. The sentence describes that Rome's officials and priests participated in the consumption of the sacrificial meat, but there is more to the story. In ancient Rome, sacrifices were an important aspect of religious and community life that were meant to honor the gods and provide a symbolic connection between the divine and human realms. When a sacrifice took place, it was often followed by a communal meal or banquet which was meant to be a shared experience for all participants. During these banquets, the sacrificial meat was typically distributed among various social groups in a hierarchical order, reflecting the social order and values of Roman society. As the statement suggests, high-ranking officials and priests, along with their families, were given priority in the consumption of the sacrificial meat. These individuals would recline in places of honor during the banquet and enjoy the choicest portions of the offerings. However, the communal meal was intended to involve not only the elite but also the general populace of Rome. Lower-ranking citizens, freedmen, slaves, and even the poor would also participate in the after-sacrifice banquet. Although they might have had to bring their own food or drink, they were also allowed to partake in the sacrificial meat, albeit in smaller or perhaps less choice portions. The distribution of sacrificial meat during this banquet reinforced social and religious bonds among the Roman population. By sharing the meat of a sacrifice, Romans believed that they were sharing a meal with the gods, thus ensuring the gods' favor and continued protection. In conclusion, the statement provided partially answers the question, as it accounts for the role of officials and priests in eating the sacrificial meat but doesn't fully emphasize the communal nature of the event. In ancient Roman sacrifices, the meat was consumed by high-ranking officials, priests, and their families, as well as lesser citizens and other members of the population, each according to their social status. This hierarchical consumption of sacrificial meat reflected the values and social structures of Roman society and reinforced religious bonds among its members."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: Who is the Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court? borat Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Gavels and Gags: The Rise of Chief Justice Borat\\" Step 1: Establish the setting and main characters Our story takes place in the state of Mississippi, where a quirky foreign journalist named Borat finds himself involved in the politics and legal system. He becomes an unlikely candidate for the position of Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court. Our protagonist's background as a reporter and comedic persona injects humor and unpredictability into the world of law and justice. Step 2: Developing the supporting characters The supporting characters include a driven campaign manager, Emma Wilson, who believes in Borat's unique perspective, and a seasoned legal assistant, Martin Thompson, who is both skeptical and intrigued by Borat's unorthodox methods. The main antagonist is the current corrupt Chief Justice, James Morrison, who feels threatened by Borat's sudden rise in popularity. Step 3: Outline the key events in the plot 1. Borat arrives in Mississippi and, while reporting on a local court case, charms the local media and public with his comedic and unpredictable antics. 2. A group of legal professionals, led by Emma Wilson, decide to use Borat's popularity to push for change in the legal system and approach him with the idea of running for Chief Justice. 3. Borat agrees, albeit with some amusing confusion, and embarks on a grassroots campaign while learning about the American justice system and court etiquette. 4. Along the way, he forms an odd yet endearing mentorship with his legal assistant, Martin Thompson, who slowly warms to Borat's lighthearted nature. 5. As his popularity and reputation grow, Borat starts to uncover the corruption and darker side of the system, something that he is ill-prepared to face. He begins to realize that his unconventional style might help expose this wrongdoing. 6. The incumbent Chief Justice, James Morrison, starts feeling threatened by Borat's success and plots to discredit him through a series of political manipulations. 7. As the election nears, tensions come to a head when a scandal is manufactured against Borat, causing him to seriously doubt his integrity and intentions. 8. With the support and encouragement of Emma and Martin, Borat perseveres and addresses the scandal with honesty, humility, and humor during a live debate. This action resonates with the public, leading to a landslide victory. 9. In the final act, Chief Justice Borat uses his newfound power to reform the legal system in Mississippi, putting an end to the corruption and becoming an unlikely champion for justice and fairness. Step 4: Concluding the story After successfully serving as the Chief Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court, Borat decides it's time to return to journalism. The friendships and connections he made during his tenure introduce a fresh and insightful perspective in the world of journalism, as he continues to make a difference using his unique charisma and humor. This satirical story, filled with comedy, emotion, and heart, will resonate with audiences as they witness an unlikely hero rise from a foreign journalist to Mississippi's Chief Justice, fighting injustice and bringing about change in this heartfelt and light-hearted movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of King Krishnadevaraya court jester? from the following article ? The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -15: (-15*q) / (-15) = -15 / (-15) Step 3: Simplify the equation. On the left side of the equation, the -15 in the numerator and the -15 in the denominator cancel each other out, leaving just the variable q: q = -15 / (-15) On the right side of the equation, -15 divided by -15 is 1: q = 1 So the solution to the equation -21*q + 6*q = -15 is q = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now where is Stacy?' Continual coverage of Drew Peterson's conviction for murdering his third wife, Kathleen Savio. 7:50 p.m. Final holdout swayed by hearsay testimony The final holdout juror said he finally decided Drew Peterson was guilty after talking with other jurors this morning. “After talking with them, in my mind I reached (that he was guilty beyond) reasonable doubt,” Supalo said. “It was only the hearsay that convicted him. If the hearsay law hadn’t been passed, he wouldn’t have been found guilty.” 6:20 p.m. Juror says verdict 'was a tough decision' One juror said the verdict \\"was a tough decision. . .We had to do what we had to do, but I think it was just.\\" Asked about his opinion of Drew Peterson, the juror said: \\"He's a good father and he had good defense attorneys but. . .I think the decision speaks for itself.\\" 5:55 p.m. Media gathers in Peterson neighborhood Four TV vans lined the street in front of Peterson's Bolingbrook home, but Peterson's oldest son, Stephen, declined interview requests. He also declined comment when reached by phone. The refusal left the assembled camera crews to train their lenses on front of the house, tracking the silhouettes of those inside. Stephen Peterson has raised his four younger step-siblings, his father's two sons with Kathleen Savio and a son and daughter born to Stacy Peterson who were toddlers when she disappeared in 2007. Stephen Peterson was fired from his job as an Oak Brook police officer after officials there said he obstructed an investigation by not telling investigators his father gave him several guns shortly after Stacy's disappearance. A few houses away, a neighbor watched the crowd of reporters forming outside the Peterson house, a scene that has become familiar to residents in the Pheasant Chase subdivision. \\"I'm sure there's going to be an appeal, and it's going to stay a circus around here for a while,\\" said the man, who declined to give his name. \\"Hopefully, the public will leave (Peterson's) children alone.\\" 5:50 p.m. Attorneys linger at courthouse More than two hours after Drew Peterson was found guilty, prosecutors and defense attorneys lingered among the crowd of reporters and onlookers on the lawn outside the courthouse. Assistant State's Attorney John Connor and his colleagues Kathy Griffin and Chris Koch gave repeated media interviews, insisting that the case was not about getting Peterson, but getting justice for Kathleen Savio. \\"Again, this case has always been about Kathleen Savio,\\" Koch said when asked how it felt to see Peterson transformed from defendant to convict. \\"And to be able to turn to the family....that's the most important thing in this case, that they were able to know that justice was served.\\" ||||| advertisement UPDATE: Jury Convicts Drew Peterson in Death of Third Wife, Kathleen Savio As deliberations reached the 12-hour mark in the Drew Peterson murder trial, jurors came back Thursday with another question, their fifth. \\"What does unanimous mean?\\" One juror, Ron Supalo, later claimed the question was sent by a single juror, during lunch, without the knowledge of the rest of the group. He declined to elaborate. Still, Judge Edward Burmila told jurors that \\"unanimous\\" meant agreed to by all. The state wanted the judge to refer them to the jury instructions. What did the question mean? Attorney Joe Lopez was heard saying he'd seen that type of question three times in previous trials and each time it meant a \\"not guilty\\" verdict. Defense attorney Ralph Meczyk said he thought it meant the jury would be hung. Jurors returned Thursday for their second day of deliberating after hearing five weeks of testimony and reaching no verdict a day earlier. Peterson, 58, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in connection with the death of his third wife, Kathleen Savio, who was found in a bathtub in 2004. Defense attorney Joel Brodsky told reporters before entering the courthouse that his client was in good spirits and prepared for the verdict. \\"He knows he's innocent,\\" Brodsky said Thursday morning. \\"[He] hopes he's not guilty because he knows he's not guilty.\\" Jurors asked a string of questions Wednesday, requesting photos, transcripts, phone records and a letter written by Savio. Burmila allowed jurors access to phone records from the weekend Savio died, as well as autopsy photos but decided against giving them the transcripts of two state witnesses. The jurors also requested dinner ordered in as they deliberated a little longer before heading home for the night. \\"Another day of waiting,\\" Brodsky said. \\"He's been in jail three-and-a-half years, so it's not like he hasn't thought about this day, if it is today.\\" It was. Shortly after jurors received their answer from the judge, they returned to the courtroom and delivered a guilty verdict. ||||| Jurors convicted Drew Peterson of murdering his third wife Thursday, capping a sensational, five-year legal saga that began after the swaggering former Illinois police officer's fourth wife vanished. FILE - In this May 8, 2009 file photo, former Bolingbrook, Ill., police sergeant Drew Peterson leaves the Will County Courthouse in Joliet, Ill., after his arraignment on charges of first-degree murder... (Associated Press) Peterson, 58, faces a maximum 60-year prison term when sentenced. Illinois has no death penalty. The prosecution built its case almost exclusively on circumstantial and hearsay evidence, including testimony about what Peterson's wives had told friends and acquaintances before the one died and the other disappeared. The verdict was a vindication for Will County prosecutors, who gambled by putting on such a case and then committed numerous stumbles during testimony that drew angry scoldings from the judge. Over the course of the investigation and prosecution, Peterson had seemingly taunted authorities, joking on talk shows and even suggesting a \\"Win a Date With Drew\\" contest. His notoriety even inspired a TV movie starring Rob Lowe. A neighbor found Kathleen Savio's body on March 1, 2004, face down in a dry bathtub of her suburban home outside Chicago. Her thick black hair was blood-soaked and she had a 2-inch gash on the back of her head. The drowning death of the 40-year-old aspiring nurse was initially deemed an accident _ a freak slip in the tub. After Peterson's fourth wife, 23-year-old Stacy Peterson, went missing in 2007 was Savio's body exhumed, re-examined and her death reclassified as a homicide. The 12 jurors, who raised eyebrows by donning different color-coordinated clothes each day of testimony, deliberated for XXdays/hours before reaching a decision. The seven men and five women included a poet, a letter carrier and a man who said his favorite TV show was \\"Criminal Minds.\\" Peterson had divorced Savio a year before her death. His motive for killing her, prosecutors said, was fear that a pending settlement, which included their 300,000 home, would wipe him out financially. Fascination nationwide with the former Bolingbrook police sergeant arose from speculation he sought to parlay three decades of law enforcement expertise into getting away with murder. Prosecutors suspect he killed his fourth wife because she could finger him for Savio's death. Stacy Peterson's family hoped a conviction in Savio's murder could lead to charges against Drew Peterson in Stacy's disappearance. Jurors weren't supposed to link the fourth wife's disappearance to the third's death. Prosecutors were prohibited from even telling jurors Stacy Peterson is presumed dead or that her husband is the lone suspect in her disappearance. He says she ran off with another man and is still alive. Prosecutors faced enormous hurdles. They had no physical evidence tying Peterson to Savio's death and no witnesses placing him at the scene. They were forced to rely on typically barred hearsay _ statements Savio made to others before she died and that Stacy Peterson made before she vanished. In 2008, Illinois passed a law tailored to Peterson's case, dubbed \\"Drew's Law,\\" permitting hearsay at trials in rare circumstances. The hearsay included friend Kristen Anderson testifying that Savio told her Peterson once warned her at knife point, \\"I could kill you and make it look like an accident.\\" Savio so feared for her life that she kept a knife under her mattress. And Stacy Peterson's pastor, Neil Schori, testified she told him that her husband got up from bed and left their house in the middle of the night around the time of Savio's death. Crying and hugging her knees, she said Drew Peterson later coached her on how to lie to police. There was damning testimony not based on hearsay. A former co-worker of Peterson's, Jeff Pachter, testified that Peterson offered him 25,000 to hire a hit man to kill Savio, though he never followed through. After Savio was found dead, Peterson told him, \\"That favor I asked you _ I don't need it anymore.\\" Prosecutors had to establish the most basic fact for a murder trial: that there was actually a murder. Pathologists testified for the defense that Savio's wounds indicated an accident. But equally well-respected pathologists for the state said it was impossible for a single fall to cause both the wound on the back of her head and bruises on the front of her body. In their three-day case, Peterson's lawyers endeavored to cast doubt on the reliability of key witnesses. They accused Savio's sister, Susan Doman, of jazzing up her testimony to profit from a movie and book deal. The last defense witness was Peterson's and Savio's 19-year-old son, Thomas Peterson. The polite, well-spoken college student cut a sympathetic figure, telling jurors he has never believed his father killed his mom. Both sides blundered parts of their presentations. Prosecutors angered the judge several times by broaching subjects previously ruled inadmissible. And as they sought to blunt the credibility of hearsay evidence, the defense ended up prompting their own witness to emphasize that Stacy Peterson was convinced her husband did kill Savio. Peterson could still win release someday. His lawyers have said they may appeal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court on grounds Illinois' hearsay law is unconstitutional. Some legal experts worried about the precedent a conviction at a trial dependent on hearsay would set, saying it could open the floodgates for the admissibility of such evidence in Illinois and elsewhere. ___ Follow Michael Tarm at http://www.twitter.com/mtarm ||||| Summary:","completion":"Drew Peterson, a former Illinois police officer, was found guilty of murdering his third wife, Kathleen Savio, after a trial that relied heavily on circumstantial and hearsay evidence. Savio's 2004 death was initially ruled an accident, but when Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, disappeared in 2007, Savio's body was exhumed and her death reclassified as a homicide. Prosecutors had no physical evidence or witnesses, so they relied on hearsay testimony, which is typically barred.

Coleco Industries Inc., a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at 65 a share in the early 1980s, filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders. Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about 430 million, would receive about 92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed. In addition, they will receive stock in the reorganized company, which will be named Ranger Industries Inc. After these payments, about 225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding. The Avon, Conn., company's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued with glitches and the company's fortunes plunged.

Is scrapping old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and releasing new 500 and 2000 rupees notes a permanent solution for eradication of black money? How would the newly introduced rs 2000 notes not contribute to laundering and black money? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick from: A). no. B). yes.","completion":"B). yes. Both questions revolve around the impact of scrapping old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and the introduction of new 500 and 2000 rupees notes on the issue of black money and money laundering in India. These measures are part of an initiative called demonetization, which aimed to eradicate black money and corruption in the country. However, it is essential to explain each aspect in detail to understand if this initiative can offer a permanent solution. Scrapping old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and demonetization was an effort to address the circulation of black money, which is the income often obtained illegally or without paying the appropriate taxes. These notes accounted for about 86% of the cash in circulation at the time of demonetization, in November 2016. By invalidating these high-value banknotes, the Indian government aimed to flush out black money holders, reduce corruption, and curb the financing of terrorism and other illegal activities. Although demonetization affected the country's economy in the short term by causing cash shortages and exacerbating deflationary trends, it prompted more citizens and businesses to adopt digital payment methods and conduct banking transactions, thereby increasing transparency within the financial system. However, saying that demonetization is a permanent solution for eradicating black money may not be entirely accurate. While it did force many black money holders to deposit their illicit funds in banks, black money generation usually depends on deeper structural issues related to tax and regulatory systems. As a result, addressing these underlying issues is essential for a long-term solution to the problem of black money. Moreover, the tax system's complexity needs simplification to encourage compliance and reduce the incentive to generate black money. The introduction of new banknotes, specifically the 2000 rupees notes, has raised concerns about their potential contribution to money laundering and black money accumulation. While the newly introduced notes were designed with enhanced security features to nullify the risk of forgery, there is still the possibility of these high-value notes being used to store unaccounted-for wealth and conduct illegal transactions. However, some measures have been taken to mitigate the risk of money laundering and black money generation through the new notes. One such measure is the increased use of digital payments in the economy following demonetization. As digital transactions become more prevalent, the reliance on physical cash decreases, affecting the generation and circulation of black money. Nevertheless, it cannot guarantee complete eradication or prevention of these problems. In conclusion, though the scrapping of old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and the introduction of new 500 and 2000 rupees notes provided a temporary solution to the black money issue, achieving permanent eradication would depend on addressing underlying structural problems like tax and regulatory systems. Additionally, regardless of the enhanced security features, the newly introduced 2000 rupees notes may still contribute to money laundering and black money if not well-regulated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The older brother was much more creative than the younger brother. - This choice introduces the concept of age (older and younger), which is not mentioned in the statement. Therefore, it cannot be inferred from the statement. 2. One of the brothers was much more imaginative than the other. - This choice directly reflects the information given in the statement – that there is a sharp contrast in imagination between the two brothers. This seems like a correct answer. 3. Both brothers had unusually large imaginations and could conjure up anything. - This choice contradicts the statement, which says that one brother has very little imagination. Therefore, it cannot be inferred from the statement. Based on the analysis, the sentence that can be inferred from the statement is: Choice 2: One of the brothers was much more imaginative than the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Maria rode the bus to work, Megan rode a motorcycle because","completion":"she loved the thrill and freedom it provided her. The morning breeze blew through her hair as she navigated the bustling city streets. Megan found a great sense of empowerment as she zipped between cars that were stuck in gridlock. Step 1: Think of an event or conflict to further develop the story. To continue the story, let's introduce a reason why Megan's choice of riding a motorcycle is significant. In this instance, Megan receives an urgent phone call from Maria about an important work deadline. Step 2: Insert the event/conflict into the story and depict characters' reactions. As Megan approached one of the many traffic lights along her route, her phone began to vibrate in her pocket. She quickly pulled over to the side of the road and fumbled with her gloves to grab the phone and answer the call. \\"Hey Maria, what's up?\\" Megan asked, slightly out of breath. \\"Hey Megan! I received an email from our boss, and it looks like we've got a sudden deadline for that big project. It's due by noon today!\\" Maria answered, her voice panicked. Step 3: Explore the consequences of the characters' choices and actions. In this case, Megan's choice of riding a motorcycle rather than taking the bus could influence how quickly she reaches the office to help Maria with the deadline. Step 4: Continue the story, highlighting how the characters' choices affect the situation. Megan couldn't believe what she was hearing. \\"You've got to be kidding me! We barely started on that project!\\" \\"I know, I know!\\" Maria responded, equally frustrated. \\"But our boss just explained that the client needs it today. Can you get to the office as soon as possible? I'll start working on it while you're on your way.\\" \\"Of course, I'll be there as fast as I can,\\" Megan promised before ending the call. The panicked anticipation that surged through her veins quickly gave her the motivation she needed to rev up her motorcycle and hit the road. Thanks to the maneuverability and speed of her motorcycle, Megan was confident she could make it to the office in time to help Maria meet the deadline. As Megan weaved through traffic and raced towards work, the tension between her and Maria over the sudden deadline had an unexpected outcome. Their mutual dedication and feelings of camaraderie were reinforced, realizing they could rely on each other to face these critical, high-pressure situations. Step 5: Wrap-up the story while leaving potential for future development. Megan arrived at the office shortly after her phone call with Maria, and the two women got to work immediately. Hours of intense focus and collaboration finally resulted in the successful completion of the project, just moments before the noon deadline. As they submitted their work, Maria and Megan exchanged relieved glances—grateful for each other's hard work and commitment. That evening, as they grabbed celebratory drinks together, Maria made a surprising proposition. \\"You know Megan, I've been thinking about taking some motorcycle lessons. Care to join me?\\" With a grin that conveyed her excitement, Megan responded enthusiastically, \\"I'd love to! Let's do it.\\" And so, the unexpected challenges faced earlier that day had not only strengthened the bonds of their friendship but also sparked a new shared passion – one that would lead to many more adrenaline-fueled adventures together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lake had less anoxia? Hint: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] The answer is:","completion":"Low Lake had less anoxia. Based on the given information, High Lake had layers of stratified water due to the mixing of fresh and saltwater, which created barriers to water mixing. This stratification could lead to anoxia or euxinia, as these layers prevent proper oxygen circulation and create zones with low concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Additionally, the stratification hindered the mixing of nutrients, causing the water to be nutrient-poor. Low nutrient availability in High Lake could lead to reduced primary production and ultimately lower overall productivity. On the other hand, Low Lake did not have the issues related to water stratification, and it was described as an abundant and prolific fishing spot. Without stratification, Low Lake would allow for better water circulation and improved oxygen distribution throughout the water column. Moreover, the absence of stratification in Low Lake facilitates the mixing of nutrients between layers, ensuring sufficient nutrient availability for primary production and supporting a healthy and diverse aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Low Lake had less anoxia, as it didn't have the water stratification issues present in High Lake, and thus had better overall water circulation and nutrient mixing to support a thriving ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

By the year 2050 there may be 12.5 billion . There are a lot of people to feed. We need more and more food. One way to produce more food is growing stronger plants. For thousands of years, farmers have made plants better. Every season, they pick the best plants for the next season. It works very slowly. Since 1983, scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified foods, or GM foods By changing the genetic material of a plant, it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases; a kind of rice is being prepared , for example , which stops people becoming blind. Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and bring in more money. Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural. No one knows how good or bad they are,. Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050. There are strong feelings against them, because they are unnatural.

The equivalent of 6.75 Empire State Buildings placed on top of one another. Biologists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California tagged eight of the whales off San Nicholas Island in southern California. They are interested in whether the whales display unusual behaviour when they hear sonar emitted from ships.","completion":"Title: A Glimpse into the Depths: Cuvier's Beaked Whales Show Remarkable Diving Capabilities Introduction The ocean covers more than 70% of our planet, representing an enormous and largely unexplored playground for a variety of marine life. Among these aquatic species lies the Cuvier’s beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), a mysterious creature known for its deep-diving capabilities and ability to stay submerged for extended periods of time. Just recently, researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, were able to record a truly remarkable diving feat by one of these whales, raising questions about the impact of sonar emissions on their behavior and the unknown depths of their world. A Record-Breaking Dive In a groundbreaking study conducted off the coast of San Nicholas Island in southern California, biologists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography succeeded in tagging eight Cuvier's beaked whales. One of these ocean giants managed to astonish the scientists with an incredible dive of 9,816 feet (2,992 meters) below the waves, staying submerged for an astounding 38 minutes. To put this in perspective, imagine stacking 6.75 Empire State Buildings on top of one another - that's the equivalent depth at which this whale plunged. Cuvier’s beaked whales: The Deep-Sea Champions Cuvier's beaked whales are not new to the limelight when it comes to deep diving and their unparalleled ability to hold their breath underwater. These whales hold the record for the longest and deepest dives among all marine mammals, often diving to depths greater than 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) and staying submerged for more than 30 minutes during hunts. Their preferential habitat is the mesopelagic zone, which encompasses the waters between 660 to 3,300 feet (200-1,000 meters) in depth, where they feed mainly on squid and deep-sea fish. Understanding the Impact of Sonar Emissions on Whale Behavior Given their unique diving capabilities, Cuvier's beaked whales have attracted significant research attention. Particularly, scientists are keen to scrutinize any possible behavioral changes these whales may display in response to sonar emitted from ships. Sonar, or sound navigation and ranging, is utilized by the military and other vessels to detect underwater objects and navigate efficiently in the vast ocean. However, these powerful sound waves may be altering the behavior of deep-diving marine life like the Cuvier's beaked whales, causing them to surface too quickly and potentially harming or even killing them in the process. By tagging and observing these whales, the biologists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography aim to gather more in-depth knowledge about how the whales might be reacting to these sonar emissions. This information can be crucial in establishing precautionary measures that could help to prevent any undue harm to these magnificent creatures, ensuring their continued existence and illustrating how humans can share and protect the ocean with minimal negative impact. Conclusion The remarkable dive of the Cuvier's beaked whale recorded by Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientists is yet another testament to the vast potential and mysteries that lie within the depths of our oceans. Not only does it shed light on the impressive abilities of this species, but it also raises important questions about how human activities, such as sonar usage, may be impacting their lives. In comprehending these unknown depths, we unlock the potential for humans and whales to co-exist harmoniously, nurturing a future in which we better understand and respect the world that lies beneath the waves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The sun naturally helps dry up excess oil. Make sure you are using a sunscreen with at least SPF 30, though, to protect your skin from the UV radiation. Make sure to apply a non-comedogenic sunscreen beforehand to avoid sunburn. Only use this method once in a while, and only after the acne heals. Too much sun exposure may actually cause acne to darken or get worse. Some acne medication may cause sensitivity to the sun. Talk to your doctor if you are currently using any prescription or over-the-counter treatments. Crush up four or five aspirin pills. Make sure there is no coating on the outside of the pills. Combine with one tablespoon lukewarm water and either a dollop of honey or plain yogurt, depending on your preference. Apply a thin layer over the entire surface of your buttocks. Allow the mask to dry before rinsing it off. Follow the treatment up with a non-comedogenic moisturizer to prevent further irritation. Do not try this treatment if you are allergic to aspirin. Always talk to your doctor before you use aspirin on a child or teenager's skin, as aspirin may be linked to Reye's syndrome in those age groups. Fresh lemon juice and apple cider vinegar diluted in water can be used to treat pimples. If your pimples have open sores, however, this can be painful. Leave on for about 5-10 minutes and rinse it off thoroughly with cool water and a gentle body wash. Be very careful with this treatment. A small amount of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar diluted in water can help dry out a zit. Applying an acid straight to your pimples, though, can be drying and may actually cause more acne. Add a few drops of honey to your diluted solution for its antibacterial and soothing effects. Tea tree and coconut oil are great antibacterial and antifungal oils that can be rubbed on the problem areas to help heal acne. Though this won't directly help heal your pimples, it will cause immediate relief from painful pimples. To make a homemade ice pack, wrap a handful of ice in a washcloth and apply it to the pimple or inflamed area for 15-20 minutes. You can also use a commercial ice pack. Just be sure there is a cloth barrier between the pack and your skin to prevent damage from the cold.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Touch is a universal language, and the very first one for humans. If a loved one is going through a tough time, offer your touch and give this person a big hug. It may sound simple but for someone who is distressed, afraid or upset, warm touch can be soothing and even calm cardiovascular stress. As a result of a lowered stress response, research shows that hugging your friend can reduce her susceptibility to sickness. Ask first to be sure hugging is an appropriate way to comfort your friend; some people do not like such physical gestures. Hold your friend close and rub her back. If she cries, let her cry into you. If you notice that your loved one seems to be trying hard to hold back what she is feeling, tell her it’s okay to show emotion. Many people feel guilty about expressing negative emotions. Others fear that they will be judged for not “keeping it together”. Tell your friend that you want her to feel whatever she’s feeling, and that you won’t judge her for it. Say something like \\"It looks like you are having a hard time right now, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen if you want to vent\\" or \\"If you need to cry, you go right ahead\\". Psychologists insist that experiencing negative emotions is just as important as feeling positive states. Negative feelings teach us so much about the natural ups and downs of life. Therefore, expressing negative feelings, as opposed to suppressing them, can be instrumental to overall mental health. Your friend may want to lounge around all day watching reality TV or thumbing through gossip magazines. Your friend may want to talk about what’s bothering her, or she may want to talk about everything but that. She may want to go shopping, or simply take a nap. Plot out a few hours of distraction-free time to focus entirely on your hurting friend. Don’t come with a specific agenda; just be present. Your friend may not feel up to doing anything or may feel overwhelmed about making any decisions. But, it's smart to have a few ideas ready in case she wants to do something. If you know a certain thing tends to bring a smile to your friend’s face, bring it to cheer her up. Understand that she may not feel any better because of this, but she will recognize that you are trying to make her feel better and likely appreciate the gesture. For example, you might bring over a comfy blanket for your friend to curl up under, a pleasant distraction in the form of a boxed set of your favorite DVDs (if she feels like watching), or a half-gallon of her favorite ice cream to share as she vents to you. If your friend is grieving or upset, she may not have had the energy to tidy up the house, pick up groceries, or take her dog out for a walk. Step forward to complete chores or errands like these, and you could remove additional stress for your friend. In addition, think practically and bring necessities that your friend and/or family may need during this time of need. Or, you can call over and ask \\"I know with all that's going on, you probably haven't had time to get groceries or household items. What can I bring you from the store?\\" List items might include disposable plates and napkins if they will be entertaining visitors as well as facial tissues and herbal tea like chamomile.","completion":"Touch is a way we can show people we care about them.

I love going to the spa. Honestly, who doesn't. These days, unfortunately, my spa trips are few and far between. I blame the damn kids for that one! So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage. Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated.

They decide to interrupt the journey in the next town called \\"Timoka\\", located in a fictitious Central European country with an incomprehensible language and on the brink of war. The sisters rent a two-room-apartment in a once-grandiose hotel. Ester suffers in her room, self-medicating with vodka and cigarettes while trying to work. Johan soon begins wandering around the hotel's hallways, encountering the elderly hotel porter and a group of Spanish dwarves who are part of a traveling show. Meanwhile, Anna ventures into the city and is openly advanced upon by a waiter in a cafe. Later, she watches a show in an uncrowded theatre, and is both repelled and fascinated when a young couple begin to have sex in a seat nearby. Anna returns to the cafe, brushes past the waiter, and returns to the hotel in time. Left with Johan while his mother is out, Ester attempts to form a more intimate bond with him, but Johan avoids her attempts to stroke his hair and face. On Anna's return, Ester is eager for an account of what her sister has done after seeing her soiled dress. Provoked, Anna spitefully fabricates a sexual encounter with the waiter to her sister. Anna also reveals her intention to meet him again that evening, which Ester, not wanting to be left alone, begs her not to do. Anna meets the man in their hotel, and Johan witnesses them kissing and entering a room down an adjacent hall. Upon returning to the room, he asks Ester, why his mother dislikes being with them, as she always departs as soon as she gets the chance. Ester tells him that she has learned a few words of the local language, and she promises to write them down for him. Johan, instinctively knowing Ester is seriously ill, embraces her in a show of...

However, Swindon won just seven of their 31 games after his appointment and were relegated from League One.

Movie title: The Gruffalo Movie plot: The protagonist of The Gruffalo is a mouse. The story of the mouse's walk through the woods unfolds in two phases; in both, the mouse uses cunning to evade danger.The mouse goes for a walk in the forest and on his way encounters several dangerous animals (a fox, an owl, and a snake). Each of these animals, clearly intent on eating the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he is going to dine with his friend, a gruffalo, whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal. The mouse describes the outlandish features of the gruffalo's monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat them, each animal flees. The mouse gloats to himself; he knows the gruffalo is a fictional monster:Silly old fox/owl/snake, doesn't he know? there's no such thing as a gruffalo!After he has seen off the last animal, however, the mouse is shocked to encounter a real gruffalo, bearlike and hideous and with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing. True to his reputation, the gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse, but again the mouse is cunning. He tells the gruffalo that he, the mouse, is the scariest animal in the forest. Laughing, the gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse as he demonstrates how everyone is afraid of him. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the animals that had earlier menaced the mouse. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off, and each time the gruffalo becomes more impressed with the mouse's apparent toughness. Exploiting this, the mouse threatens to eat the gruffalo, who himself flees.The story is based on a traditional Chinese folk tale of a fox that borrows the terror of a tiger. Donaldson was unable to think of rhymes for \\"tiger\\" so invented one for \\"know\\" instead. The answer is:","completion":"The three predators that want to eat the mouse in the movie \\"The Gruffalo\\" are a fox, an owl, and a snake. The movie's plot unfolds in such a way that the mouse, while on a walk through the forest, encounters each of these dangerous animals one by one. The fox, eager to have the mouse for his meal, tries to lure the mouse back to his place by extending an invite. But, the quick-thinking and cunning mouse skillfully declines the fox's offer. To safeguard himself, the mouse concocts a tale about his made-up friend, the gruffalo, who, incidentally, enjoys dining on foxes. Next, the mouse meets the owl, who also sees the small creature as a potential meal and invites him to his home. Again, the mouse utilizes his cleverness to decline the invite, using the same gruffalo story that scared off the fox, mentioning that one of the gruffalo's favourite foods is an owl. Lastly, the mouse encounters a snake. The snake, like the fox and the owl before him, wants to eat the mouse and invites him back to his place. Sticking to his narrative, the mouse tells the snake about his monstrous \\"friend\\", the gruffalo, whose favourite dish, he says, is snake meat. The story pays homage to the traditional Chinese folktale of a fox that uses the terror of the tiger to his advantage. In this adaptation, the mouse uses the imaginary threat of the gruffalo to scare away each predator he meets, showing his cunningness and intelligence until he comes face-to-face with an actual gruffalo, setting the stage for another round of wit and cunning. It's a delightful narrative that highlights the intelligence and adaptability of the protagonist, despite the physical superiority of his adversaries, making for a compelling and engaging story that can be appreciated by viewers of all ages.

Task: Explain the connection between oil, dinosaur carcasses, and energy sources. Step 1: Identify the sources of oil Oil is formed from the remains of ancient marine plants and animals, such as algae and zooplankton. These remains gradually became buried under layers of sediment, where they were eventually subjected to heat and pressure, leading to the formation of oil. Step 2: Understand the role of dinosaur carcasses in fossil fuels formation Dinosaur carcasses are also a source of fossil fuels, specifically petroleum and natural gas. Similar to the process mentioned above, dinosaur remains were buried under layers of sediment and subjected to heat and pressure, resulting in the creation of fossil fuels. However, it is crucial to mention that not all fossil fuels come solely from dinosaurs, as plant materials also played a significant role. Step 3: Demonstrate the connection between fossil fuels and energy sources Both oil and the fossil fuels formed from dinosaur carcasses are hydrocarbons, meaning they contain carbon and hydrogen atoms. When these hydrocarbons are burned, they release chemical energy in the form of heat and light. This energy can then be harnessed for various purposes, such as generating electricity, powering vehicles, and producing heat for homes and industries. Step 4: Summarize the connection In conclusion, oil and the fossil fuels derived from dinosaur carcasses are connected through their shared origin and ability to provide energy. Both substances are formed from organic matter that has been subjected to heat and pressure, resulting in the creation of hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons can then be burned to release energy, making them valuable sources of power for various applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was compelled to watch each week just to hear what he would come up with next. I was stunned when he was voted off so early. I have been watching and waiting ever since to see when he would come out with his first album. I knew it would be fabulous, and I was not disappointed. When you buy an album, it is usually to hear a song or two, but his whole album is worth listening to. I count him amoung my favorite artists, and eagerly await his next album. This is a must have.

The odour of a familiar human apparently lingers like perfume in the animal's brain - where it triggers an instinctive emotional response, research published yesterday reveals. Our scent acts on a part of the canine brain associated with reward and the strongest reactions are produced by humans that pets know best, say scientists in America. Gregory Berns, of Emory University in Atlanta, said: 'While we might expect that dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of other dogs, it seems that the \\"reward response\\" is reserved for their humans. 'When humans smell the perfume or cologne of someone they love, they may have an immediate, emotional reaction that's not necessarily cognitive. 'Our experiment may be showing the same process in dogs. But since dogs are so much more olfactory than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. 'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen. 'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present. Why do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans. Dolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor 'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.' The university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them. The scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household.

Information: - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was an Irish playwright, novelist, essayist, and poet. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He is remembered for his epigrams, his novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death. - The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde, first published complete in the July 1890 issue of \\"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\\". The magazine's editor feared the story was indecent, and without Wilde's knowledge, deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year. - \`\` The Canterville Ghost '' is a short story by Oscar Wilde , widely adapted for the screen and stage . It was the first of Wilde 's stories to be published . The story is about a family who moves to a castle haunted by the ghost of a dead nobleman , who killed his wife and was starved to death by his wife 's brothers . - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.

Some of the footpaths on Jianmenguan Mountain in Jiange County, southwest China's Sichuan Province, date from nearly 1,000 years ago from China's Three Kingdoms Period. Over the years, these footpaths have been extended and a more modern addition is a protruding skywalk. Tourists can enjoy spectacular views from the Jianmenguan mountain in Jiange County, southwest China's Sichuan Province. A maze of different footpaths traverse the mountain, winding in and out of the cliff faces and offering amazing views of the surroundings. Some of the routes are more 'safe' than others, with ledges to hold on to and steps for comfort, others, as right, are more perilous. The routes are favoured with tourists, and offer the perfect opportunity to snap some photographs of nature at it's most beautiful. And the location is steeped in history. There are 72 peaks in the mountain range, and only one through road. The Battle of Jianmen Pass was fought between the communists and the nationalists during the Chinese Civil War in the post World War II era and resulted in communist victory in 1949. This is one of the more futuristic walkways on Jianmenguan mountain in Jiange County, where visitors get unrivalled views. The paths are favoured with tourists, and offer the perfect opportunity to snap some photographs of nature at it's most beautiful. Whoever controlled this 1.5mile long stretch of the road controlled the gateway of Sichuan, and the nationalists had built an elaborate system of bunkers in the area to strengthen its defense against the expected communist invasion. The communists managed to capture over 300 prisoners-of-wars and had all the remaining people killed in the fierce battle, and more importantly, the taking of Jianmen Pass secured the passage for the communists to invade deeper into the heart of Sichuan. Much history is contained within the mountain, where steps can be traced from the great battle between the communists and nationalists.

The new technique uses sonic stimulation to excite the neurons in the thalamus, the brain’s central hub for processing information. A 25-year-old man recovering from a coma has made remarkable progress following a treatment at UCLA to jump-start his brain using ultrasound. The technique uses sonic stimulation to excite the neurons in the thalamus, an egg-shaped structure that serves as the brain’s central hub for processing information. “It’s almost as if we were jump-starting the neurons back into function,” said Martin Monti, the study’s lead author and a UCLA associate professor of psychology and neurosurgery. “Until now, the only way to achieve this was a risky surgical procedure known as deep brain stimulation, in which electrodes are implanted directly inside the thalamus,” he said. “Our approach directly targets the thalamus but is noninvasive.” Monti said the researchers expected the positive result, but he cautioned that the procedure requires further study on additional patients before they determine whether it could be used consistently to help other people recovering from comas. “It is possible that we were just very lucky and happened to have stimulated the patient just as he was spontaneously recovering,” Monti said. A report on the treatment is published in the journal Brain Stimulation. This is the first time the approach has been used to treat severe brain injury. Martin Monti/UCLA The researchers targeted the thalamus with low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation. The technique, called low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation, was pioneered by Alexander Bystritsky, a UCLA professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences in the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior and a co-author of the study. Bystritsky is also a founder of Brainsonix, a Sherman Oaks, California-based company that provided the device the researchers used in the study. That device, about the size of a coffee cup saucer, creates a small sphere of acoustic energy that can be aimed at different regions of the brain to excite brain tissue. For the new study, researchers placed it by the side of the man’s head and activated it 10 times for 30 seconds each, in a 10-minute period. Monti said the device is safe because it emits only a small amount of energy — less than a conventional Doppler ultrasound. Before the procedure began, the man showed only minimal signs of being conscious and of understanding speech — for example, he could perform small, limited movements when asked. By the day after the treatment, his responses had improved measurably. Three days later, the patient had regained full consciousness and full language comprehension, and he could reliably communicate by nodding his head “yes” or shaking his head “no.” He even made a fist-bump gesture to say goodbye to one of his doctors. “The changes were remarkable,” Monti said. The technique targets the thalamus because, in people whose mental function is deeply impaired after a coma, thalamus performance is typically diminished. And medications that are commonly prescribed to people who are coming out of a coma target the thalamus only indirectly. Under the direction of Paul Vespa, a UCLA professor of neurology and neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, the researchers plan to test the procedure on several more people beginning this fall at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Those tests will be conducted in partnership with the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center and funded in part by the Dana Foundation and the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation. If the technology helps other people recovering from coma, Monti said, it could eventually be used to build a portable device — perhaps incorporated into a helmet — as a low-cost way to help “wake up” patients, perhaps even those who are in a vegetative or minimally conscious state. Currently, there is almost no effective treatment for such patients, he said. The study’s other co-authors are Vespa, who holds UCLA’s Gary L. Brinderson Family Chair in Neurocritical Care and is director of neurocritical care at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center; Caroline Schnakers, a UCLA neurosurgery researcher; and Alexander Korb, a Semel Institute researcher. ||||| A new discovery by medical researchers shows a significantly better recovery might be possible for future coma patients. A team at UCLA recently used ultrasound to “jump-start” the brain of a 25-year-old man after a coma. The doctors called his improvements “remarkable,” which might mark this as a big breakthrough. In their paper on the procedure in the academic journal Brain Stimulation, the researchers write that many patients “fail to fully recover from coma, and awaken to a disorder of consciousness such as the vegetative state or the minimally conscious state.” The noninvasive procedure used sonic stimulation to excite the neurons in the thalamus, which essentially serves as the brain’s central hub for processing information such as the relaying of sensory and motor signals as well as the regulation of consciousness, sleep and alertness. This is the first time this technique, called low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation, has been used to treat a severe brain injury. “It’s almost as if we were jump-starting the neurons back into function,” Martin Monti, the study’s lead author and a UCLA associate professor of psychology and neurosurgery, told Medical Xpress. With a device that emits a very small amount of energy (less than a traditional ultrasound machine), the doctors were able to target the thalamus. They placed it near the side of the patient’s head and activated it for 30 seconds every minute for a 10-minute period. Monti explained that until now, the only way to achieve this result was a risky surgical procedure known as deep brain stimulation. This requires the implantation of electrodes directly inside the thalamus. “Our approach directly targets the thalamus but is noninvasive,” he said. He added that the team was expecting positive results, but that more research needs to be done on additional patients to determine if the technique can consistently be used as a treatment for coma patients. “As the authors pointed out, with this type of study it is difficult to know if the patient’s improvement was due to the brain stimulation or just the patient improving on his own,” Dr. Aaron S. Lord, director of neurocritical care at NYU Langone Medical Center, told the Observer. “However, targeting the thalamus to stimulate a patient with a disorder of consciousness has been successful in the past, and this new technology has the benefit of being non-invasive, unlike the deep brain stimulation which requires neurosurgery.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Doctors at UCLA have helped a 25-year-old man recover from a coma by using a new technique called low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation.

Hunting Hunting also has a significant financial impact in the United States, with many companies specialising in hunting equipment or speciality tourism.

Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block.

Jesse decided to get a copyright on her book, because she was worried that if she didn't get the Choose your answer from: + copyright her ideas would be stolen.; + book her ideas would be stolen.;","completion":"copyright, her ideas would be stolen. She had spent years painstakingly crafting her unique manuscript and didn't want to leave her intellectual property vulnerable to theft. The novel itself was a rich blend of genres, melding science fiction, fantasy, and romance into a thrilling adventure that followed the protagonist, Luna, in her quest to save a fragile world from the brink of destruction. Luna's journey took her through lush, magical forests, and across barren and desolate landscapes, all the while battling her own demons and forming unlikely alliances. Jesse poured her heart and soul into creating this complex world with intricate backstories and interwoven subplots, and she knew she couldn't risk losing the fruits of her labor. To protect her hard work, Jesse began researching the copyright process. She discovered that in most countries, copyright protection was automatic upon the creation of an original work. This meant that her book already had some degree of protection. However, Jesse decided that it would be prudent to take additional steps to ensure her work's security. In order to formally register her book's copyright, Jesse contacted her country's copyright office and obtained the necessary application form. After filling in the required information, she attached a digital copy of her manuscript and sent the completed form, manuscript, and application fee to the copyright office. Once the application was received and processed, Jesse would obtain a certificate of registration that provided her with full copyright protection. In the meantime, Jesse took the initiative to add a copyright notice to the front matter of her book, indicating her ownership of the work and the year it was created. This served as a clear warning to potential infringers that she took her rights seriously. Although the formal registration process wasn't complete yet, Jesse felt more at ease knowing that steps had been taken to protect her book from theft. With her newfound peace of mind, she could now focus on finding a literary agent to represent her work and pursuing her dream of getting her novel published. Jesse spent the following weeks refining her query letter and researching reputable agents within her book's genres. After numerous rejected queries, she finally caught the attention of an agent who expressed enthusiasm for the novel. Before signing an agreement, Jesse made sure to consult with the agent on their stance on protecting her copyright. Together, the two drafted a strategic plan for releasing her book into the public eye. They agreed on a distribution method that utilized digital rights management, ensuring that electronic copies of her novel would be traceable and protected against piracy. Additionally, the plan involved securing licensing deals for translations, adaptations, and any potential derivative works. Jesse and her agent were thorough in their approach to preserving her creative control and ensuring she would reap the benefits of her passion project. Soon, Jesse's novel was published, and the world eagerly received Luna's story. The book quickly gained a loyal following, propelling Jesse into the realm of literary acclaim. Throughout her newfound success, Jesse remained vigilant about safeguarding her work, consistently monitoring and taking action against any infringement on her copyright. In the end, Jesse's diligence in securing her copyright allowed her to share her captivating tale with the world while still protecting her personal, creative investment. The lessons she learned throughout this process armed her with the knowledge and expertise to safeguard future contributions to the literary world, and she became a celebrated role model for aspiring authors. And as for Luna and the fantastical universe Jesse had created, their adventures continued, warranting sequels and adaptations, with Jesse's watchful eye ensuring her vision remained intact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement suggests that the speaker is about to provide their opinion or perspective. This could be a perspective based on certain principles or values such as democracy, socialism, or a philosophical theory underpinning their view on governance. Given the phrases 'to determine quite specifically' and 'albeit briefly', it is implied that the forthcoming opinion or perspective will be articulated concisely and will not offer an extensive or in-depth exploration of the topic at hand. The phrase 'what we think' indicates a collective perspective, which could suggest a group of individuals, an organization, or a community holds this perspective. Moreover, the phrase 'the state should be like, in general', implies a focus on the general characteristics or principles that should ideally underpin a state or government, rather than specific policies or issues. This could include topics such as the distribution of power, the role of the state in relation to civil society, the economy, individual freedoms, and the rights and responsibilities of citizens. So, this statement implies that the speaker is about to provide a concise but definitive perspective on the principles or characteristics that an ideal state or government should embody. It is likely to be a high-level discussion of the philosophy of governance, rather than a detailed policy discussion. In general, such discussions contribute to a wider discourse on political theory and philosophy, and can inform perspectives on governance, policy-making, and statecraft. Understanding different perspectives on what a 'state' should be can help individuals and societies shape their expectations and prescriptions for governance in a manner that aligns with their values and ideals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (; ), usually referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time. - Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term). Alternative names for the \\"count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as \\"Graf\\" in Germany and \\"Hakushaku\\" during the Japanese Imperial era. - Good faith, in human interactions, is a sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction. While some Latin phrases lose their literal meaning over centuries, this is not the case with \\"bona fides\\"; it is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern day translation of \\"good faith\\". It is an important concept within law, philosophy, and business. The opposed concepts are bad faith, \\"mala fides\\" (duplicity) and perfidy (pretense). In contemporary English, the usage of \\"bona fides\\" (note the \\"s\\") is synonymous with credentials and identity. The phrase is sometimes used in job advertisements, and should not be confused with the \\"bona fide\\" occupational qualifications or the employer's good faith effort, as described below. - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary. - An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by \\"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \\"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\\" etc. - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - The Kingdom of God Is Within You ( Russian : ( Tsarstvo Bozhiye vnutri vas ) ) is a non-fiction book written by Leo Tolstoy . A philosophical treatise , the book was first published in Germany in 1894 after being banned in his home country of Russia . It is the culmination of thirty years of Tolstoy 's thinking , and lays out a new organization for society based on a literal Christian interpretation . The Kingdom of God is Within You is a key text for Tolstoyan , nonviolent resistance , and Christian anarchist movements . - A treatise is a formal and systematic written discourse on some subject, generally longer and treating it in greater depth than an essay, and more concerned with investigating or exposing the principles of the subject. What entity does 'the kingdom of god is within you' has the relation 'genre' with? A:","completion":"The entity 'The Kingdom of God Is Within You' has the relation 'genre' with 'Non-fiction'. This means that 'The Kingdom of God Is Within You' is of the non-fiction genre. Non-fiction is content whose creator assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented.

Premise: \\"oh yeah sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"We don't have to pay anything.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"oh yeah sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something\\" is true, it tells us several things about the hypothesis \\"We don't have to pay anything.\\" First, it reveals a logical inconsistency between the premise and the hypothesis, suggesting that they cannot both be true at the same time. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the truth of the premise negates the possibility of the hypothesis being true, leading us to consider the relationship between the two statements, possible explanations for the inconsistency and implications for the broader context in which these statements are being made. Analyzing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes clear that they are logically contradictory statements. The premise states that there is a cost associated with something—a statement that inherently implies the existence of payment. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that there is no need to pay anything. In any given situation, it is impossible for both of these statements to be accurate simultaneously, as one negates the other. Thus, if the premise is considered true, the hypothesis becomes false. There could be several reasons for this inconsistency. One possibility is that the premise and the hypothesis refer to different contexts or aspects of a situation, but have been presented as if they are related. For example, the premise might refer to the cost of purchasing a good or service, while the hypothesis might refer to additional costs associated with that good or service once the initial payment has been made. In this case, it is important to recognize that the apparent contradiction arises from the misinterpretation of the relationship between the two statements, rather than the falsity of one of them. Another possibility is that the premise and hypothesis represent competing viewpoints or beliefs about a particular situation, with one being accurate and the other being incorrect. If, for example, two people are discussing the cost of a software subscription, one person might be convinced that there are hidden costs (the premise) while the other believes otherwise (the hypothesis). In this case, the inconsistency between the two statements highlights the underlying conflict between the beliefs of the individuals involved. Regardless of the cause of the inconsistency, the fact that the premise and hypothesis appear in conflict with each other has implications for the broader context in which they are presented. It suggests that further analysis and information gathering may be needed to determine the accuracy of each statement or to reconcile the apparent contradiction between them. It is also worth noting that the truth of the premise does not necessarily dependent upon whether the hypothesis is false. For example, one might have to pay an initial cost but not have to worry about ongoing expenses. Hence, it is important to keep an open mind when evaluating the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, and not to jump to conclusions based on the apparent discrepancy between them. In conclusion, given the premise \\"oh yeah sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something,\\" the possibility of the hypothesis \\"We don't have to pay anything\\" being true becomes highly unlikely due to their logically contradictory nature. Further exploration of the context and possible explanations for their inconsistency will provide valuable insights into the broader situation and help to clarify the relationship between the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The world, in painter Chen Xiao's eyes, is as colorful and sweet as ice cream. At the opening of his latest exhibition, Colorful World in the Eyes of Sean Chen, at the National Museum of China recently, the artist told his story. Chen left China for Australia in 1986 to seek artistic freedom, and like many new immigrants then, he had little money in his pocket. To make ends meet, he drew portraits of people in the street. Every day, he saw people buy ice cream from a shop. Chen couldn't help wondering: \\"It must taste great, that's why so many people buy it.\\" But he didn't buy one for himself because he had to save money to support his studies. After four months of painting there and watching people eat ice cream, Chen didn't resist the temptation --- he bought an ice cream. \\"The first bite took me to heaven,\\" Chen recalls while laughing. \\"You know, as a poor young man in a new country, an ice cream was too expensive then.\\" Since then, he kept the taste of the ice cream in his heart and included the happy feelings in his paintings, which turn out to be colorful and sweet. His current exhibition is part of his nationwide tour that began at the National Art Museum of China in Beijing in 2011. He plans to take his artworks to 24 cities around China by 2016. The exhibition at the National Art Museum of China will last until April 22. After the exhibition tour, he will sell his works through an auction , and all the money will be donated to protection of the environment in China. \\"The natural environment of New Zealand has inspired my artwork and brought me enjoyment. I hope people in my home country can enjoy the same beautiful environment as I do,\\" says Chen, who has made New Zealand his home for the last 26 years.

A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount). - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish. - The River Cuckmere rises near Heathfield in East Sussex, England on the southern slopes of the Weald. The name of the river probably comes from an Old English word meaning \\"fast-flowing\\", since it descends over 100 m (328 ft) in its initial four miles (6.4 km).

Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand.

It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Romania is a sovereign state located in Southeastern Europe. It borders the Black Sea, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, and Moldova. It has an area of and a temperate-continental climate. With 19.94 million inhabitants, the country is the seventh-most-populous member state of the European Union. The capital and largest city, Bucharest, with its 1,883,425 inhabitants is the sixth-largest city in the EU. - The Late Cretaceous (100.566 Ma) is the younger of two epochs into which the Cretaceous period is divided in the geologic timescale. Rock strata from this epoch form the Upper Cretaceous series. The Cretaceous is named after the white limestone known as chalk which occurs widely in northern France and is seen in the white cliffs of south-eastern England, and which dates from this time. - The tibia (plural tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and it connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula, and closer to the median plane or centre-line. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of the leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute \\"tibia\\". It is the second largest bone in the human body next to the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body. - The femur (pl. \\"femurs\\" or \\"femora\\" ) or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the hip joint) bone of the [leg] in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the hindlimbs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and kneecap forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body. The femur is also the longest bone in the body. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Orthomerus ( meaning \`\` straight femur '' ) is a genus of duckbill dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of The Netherlands and Belgium . It is today an obscure genus , but in the past was conflated with the much better known Telmatosaurus . - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A hindlimb is a posterior limb on an animal, especially the quadrupeds. When referring to quadrupeds, the term hind leg is often instead used. - In humans, the thigh is the area between the pelvis and the knee. Anatomically, it is part of the lower limb. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Hadrosaurids (\\"hadrós\\", \\"stout, thick\\"), or duck-billed dinosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is also known as the duck-billed dinosaurs, for the flat, duck-bill appearance of their mouths. The family, which includes ornithopods such as \\"Edmontosaurus\\" and \\"Parasaurolophus\\", was a common herbivore in the Upper Cretaceous Period of what is now Asia, Europe, Antarctica, South America and North America. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Like the rest of the ornithischians, these animals had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Hadrosaurids are divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (\\"Lambeosaurinae\\"), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes, and the saurolophines, identified as hadrosaurines in most pre-2010 works (\\"Saurolophinae\\" or\\" Hadrosaurinae\\"), which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines are divided into Aralosaurines, Lambeosaurines, Parasaurolophines and Tsintaosaurines, while Saurolophines include Saurolophus, Brachylophosaurines and Kritosaurines. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - The High Fens , which were declared a nature reserve in 1957, are an upland area, a plateau region in the province of Liège, in the east of Belgium and adjoining parts of Germany, between the Ardennes and the Eifel highlands. The High Fens are the largest nature reserve or park in Belgium, with an area of ; it lies within the German-Belgian natural park \\"Hohes Venn-Eifel\\", in the Ardennes. Its highest point, at above sea level, is the Signal de Botrange near Eupen, and also the highest point in Belgium. A tower high was built here that reaches above sea level. The reserve is a rich ecological endowment of Belgium covered with alpine sphagnum raised bogs (not \\"fens\\" as the name would imply) both on the plateau and in the valley basin; the bogs, which are over 10,000 years old, with their unique subalpine flora, fauna and microclimate, are key to the conservation work of the park. - The knee joint joins the thigh with the leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint). It is the largest joint in the human body. The knee is a modified hinge joint, which permits flexion and extension as well as slight internal and external rotation. The knee joint is vulnerable to injury and to the development of osteoarthritis. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Your doctor can provide direction, specific to your body and your situation, that can help you choose the best way to increase your progesterone levels. Your doctor is your best resource to understanding the changes or problems you are experiencing. Discuss supplements and lifestyle adjustments with your doctor to be sure that is the best option for you. Vitamin C, vitamin E, l-arginine, vitamin B6, selenium, and beta carotene have all been shown to increase progesterone levels. While natural sources of these supplements are part of a healthy diet, the vitamin or supplement content found in natural sources is not enough to make a difference in increasing your progesterone levels. Consider using manufactured products that contain higher concentrations of vitamins and supplements. Studies have shown the following amounts to be beneficial in increasing progesterone levels: Consume 750mg of Vitamin C per day (increased progesterone levels by as much as 77%). Consume 600mg of Vitamin E per day (Increased progesterone in 67% of patients studied) . Take 6gm per day of L-arginine (improved serum progesterone in 71% of patients) . Take 200mg to 800mg per day of vitamin B6 (reduces blood levels of estrogen and improves concentrations of progesterone) . Add selenium to your daily vitamin doses (consuming selenium at any dose was shown to improve progesterone levels) . Consume more beta-carotene (studies in animals showed improvement in progesterone levels and fertility) . Losing weight, avoiding large meals, eating a high protein and low carbohydrate diet, decreasing saturated fat intake, and increasing consumption of unsaturated fats, are recommended to improve your levels of progesterone. Studies in overweight women show that losing as little as 5% of your body weight improves your progesterone levels. In an animal study, the amount of available food was controlled during early pregnancy, resulting in higher levels of hormones needed to support pregnancy in the group that was not allowed to over eat. Dietary changes that included higher amounts of protein and lower amounts of carbohydrates were positively correlated to improving progesterone levels in the women studied. One animal study showed significant increases in progesterone when the diet was higher in omega 3 and omega 6 products contained in flaxseed, combined with a lower intake of saturated fats. While dairy products contain only small amounts of progesterone, research has shown a significant increase in progesterone levels in men when they consumed three servings per day of high-fat dairy products. The nicotine found in cigarettes can interfere with the way your ovaries naturally produce hormones, which disrupts processes involved with normal cyclic functioning. Cigarette smoking also adds to the risk of serious, and possibly life-threatening, adverse events when combined with products that contain estrogen or progesterone. Stress only adds to the complications that are already at work as you are trying to provide a healthy hormonal balance. Use relaxation techniques that help you to breathe more deeply and stretch your muscles to reduce tension. Take time out for a massage, and routinely take part in activities you enjoy.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: Jonathan Abrams could have gone down as one of the world's most successful tech founders. Instead, he spends his time reading and sharing dozens of news stories each week about tech companies more successful than his own. On any given day, you might see Abrams tweet articles about aging entrepreneurs, the latest billion dollar tech startup or Facebook's evolving ad efforts. He finds these articles through Nuzzel, a social news aggregator that he built and launched in beta in September 2012. \\"Starting Nuzzel was about my own personal problem of having cool stuff that my friends are doing on Facebook and Twitter, but not keeping on top of it all,\\" he told Mashable in an interview last month. That sentiment is common enough. There are, after all, no shortage of people building and using social news readers for precisely that reason. But those people are not Jonathan Abrams. Twelve years ago, he founded Friendster and helped kick off the era of social networks. Ten years ago, he watched as Facebook launched and gradually became the market leader. A little more than one year ago, he released Nuzzel to make the most of the new crop of social networks that have surpassed his own. His role at the new venture has effectively turned him into an unofficial media critic. \\"Right now, running Nuzzel, I read a lot of online news,\\" he says. \\"I see stuff everyday that isn't true.\\" This extends to stories written over the years about the reasons for Friendster's launch and eventual decline. \\"There was the idea that I started Friendster to meet girls, to get dates, which was never true,\\" he says. \\"There was the idea that Friendster's problem was fake profiles.\\" The real story, as he tells it, is more complicated and full of even more missed opportunities than you might assume for a tech company that missed one of the biggest opportunities in recent memory. Friendster's website in late 2004, a few months after Facebook launched. Abrams doesn't remember the exact moment he heard about Facebook, but it wasn't long after it launched in February 2004. Not quite two years old then, Friendster had already come up against many new competitors and clones. Michael Birch, best known for selling Bebo to AOL and later buying it back, launched Ringo.com three days after hearing about Friendster, later describing it as \\"a copycat site of Friendster.\\" Google launched Orkut, a failed early attempt at a social network, in January 2004 after attempting a Friendster acquisition. Even one of Friendster's investors, future Zynga founder Mark Pincus, launched a social networking competitor in 2003 called Tribe.net. If all that wasn't enough, there was MySpace, which was founded in late 2003. According to Abrams, the team at MySpace would spam Friendster's message boards, trying to poach users. \\"It was a really weird time. Friendster at the time was still a very small company,\\" he says. \\"We viewed ourselves as the David, not the Goliath. There were the Yahoos and the AOLs and we were this tiny, little startup. But the moment Friendster got the publicity, people started to copy it. Of course we were aware of all of them.\\" Even with all that competition, Abrams recognized early on that Facebook might pose a unique threat. On Friendster, users could set up profiles, connect with friends and family, search for new contacts (and, yes, potential dates) based on the people you were already connected to and interact with people on the social network through messages and groups. It was essentially a more pared down version of Facebook and the latter had the added benefit of quickly gaining popularity among college students. In response, Abrams claims now that he suggested Friendster should launch a \\"Friendster College\\" initiative to establish itself on 20 college campuses before Facebook could scale to that level. He says he had wanted to build the equivalent of a news feed even before Facebook launched, and that he had plans to build tools on top of the \\"Friendster social graph,\\" including one for sharing music playlists. In short, he wanted to take Friendster and evolve it to become what we now know as Facebook. \\"The problem,\\" he says, \\"was that Friendster was having a lot of technology problems.\\" Friendster had raised an additional 13 million in funding in 2003 and, according to Abrams, investors weren't focused on patching up the service properly, let alone responding to the threats posed by upstarts like Facebook. \\"The fact that we didn't launch those products was a problem, but even more fundamentally, people could barely log into the website for two years,\\" he says. \\"By the time Facebook and MySpace was doing those things, Friendster had lost a lot of market share in the U.S. for stability issues.\\" In April 2004, two months after Facebook launched, Friendster's board replaced Abrams as CEO and moved him in the mostly powerless chairman role. \\"I'm not very close to Mark Zuckerberg,\\" Abrams says, in a huge understatement. \\"But we've met.\\" That meeting, according to Abrams, occurred later in 2004 while he was chairman of Friendster and Scott Sassa was its president and CEO. Friendster wanted to buy Facebook. Abrams declined to provide a precise acquisition offer, but suggested it wasn't large enough to interest Zuckerberg and his team at the time. \\"I never thought he would sell to Friendster, but one of the CEOs was interested in trying to pursue it,\\" Abrams says, referring to Sassa. Some six years later, the two businesses entered into an acquisition agreement of a different sort: Facebook bought Friendster's entire portfolio of social networking patents for a reported 40 million. By this time, Facebook was on the cusp of hitting 500 million users worldwide, and Friendster had drifted into irrelevance — at least in the western hemisphere. Like minidisc players and QR codes, Friendster made its last stand in Asia. The social network was acquired in 2009 — not by \\"goliaths\\" like Yahoo or AOL, or Google, which had offered to buy it years earlier — by MOL Global, an online payments provider based in Malaysia. Friendster had 115 million members at the time of the acquisition, the vast majority of which (more than 75 million) lived in Asia. A little more than a year later, Friendster started again from scratch, deleting its users' data and pivoting to become a gaming service. Friendster.com still exists today, though it bares little resemblance to the Friendster of old. It's currently ranked as the 20,815th most popular site in the world, according to data from Alexa, with most of its visitors coming from India, Malaysia and the Philippines. Facebook is the second most popular site the world. The inside of Slide, a San Francisco nightclub that Abrams co-owns. It takes some effort to find references to Friendster today on Nuzzel's website, despite the fact that the startup has several former Friendster employees on staff. The word isn't listed on the main page of the beta site; it first appears below the fold on the About page as part of Abrams' bio, sandwiched between two other startups he's worked on. Abrams is still proud of Friendster, but he prefers not to talk about those days, noting in the first of several curt email exchanges that he doesn't have time for \\"old stuff about Friendster.\\" Shortly after leaving the social network he founded in 2005, Abrams launched Socializr, an online tool for sharing events, which later laid off its team in 2009 and was acquired the following year. He is the cofounder of Founders Den, which provides shared office space, and occasionally does some angel investing. He even co-owns a nightclub in San Francisco called Slide, though he says he doesn't go out to nightclubs much anymore for the same reason he doesn't use Snapchat. \\"Part of it is where I'm at with my personal life right now. I'm not single, I'm a parent. I'm not using Tinder and Snapchat; I'm just not there in my life,\\" he says. \\"When I started Friendster 11 years ago, I was not in my 20s, but in my 30s, and I was single and it was a different stage for me.\\" Abrams does have accounts on Facebook and Twitter, though he prefers the latter and rarely uses either for personal purposes. Mostly he prefers email. Friendster may be relegated to punchline-status these days, but Abrams argues the startup had a positive impact on his life overall. \\"Whenever you step out and do something, you are going to get both positive and negative feedback. That's just what happens when you create things,\\" he says. \\"Absolutely there are people who have criticized me for things involving Friendster — sometimes things that are not true. But overall, most of the legacy of Friendster is pretty positive. And there are a lot of connections and relationships that I have that may have been started because of Friendster.\\" For now, Abrams continues to work on developing Nuzzel and suggests the news reader may finally come out of beta in the near future. As it so happens, though, Facebook just launched a social news reader of its own. Ten years later, Abrams may end up competing with Facebook all over again. Have something to add to this story?

It happened at the new store located at One Bellevue Place around 9 a.m. Metro Animal Care and Control said the raid came after they received information, photos and videos of \\"what appeared to be inadequate care for injured animals at the PetSmart location in Bellevue.\\" Animal control officers confiscated six animals from the store - a guinea pig, mice and hamsters. All six animals were taken to a local vet to be checked out. PETA alleges managers at the Bellevue store were \\"observed repeatedly refusing to provide sick, injured and dying animals with veterinary care in order to 'keep costs down' so they would receive bonuses.\\" PETA also claims a Nashville supervisor was recorded instructing staff not to tell customers that PetSmart buys animals from Sun Pet Ltd., a warehouse in Atlanta that was put on probation by the Georgia Department of Agriculture after a PETA investigation in 2010. A PetSmart employee, who has worked for the company for several years, told News 2 off-camera she completely refutes the allegations made by PETA. She said she's never seen animals abused or mistreated when they're sick. She told News 2 if animals get sick, the staff cares for them. District Attorney Glenn Funk's office is overseeing the investigation led by animal control. The store reopened Thursday afternoon. PetSmart released the following statement to News 2. We are always committed to putting the needs of the pets in our care first. We empower our store associates to do what’s right for all pets, which includes instruction to have any sick animal immediately seen by a veterinarian if needed. There is no adverse effect on a store team that takes every step possible to care for pets. We take these allegations very seriously, and are working closely with the Bellevue authorities to obtain the relevant facts. Additionally, we are investigating the validity of the video, given some of the footage is several years old. The investigation is ongoing. ||||| PETA claims that the staff failed to provide care to a mouse with swollen eyes for more than two weeks. (Source: PETA) Metro Police and Metro Animal Care and Control raided a national pet store chain location Thursday after getting a tip about animal cruelty. Metro Animal Control took away six rodents from the One Bellevue Place PetSmart store, including hamsters, mice and a guinea pig. “They sell these as companion animals, and we strongly believe that these animals big or small that if there is a complaint, that’s what we’re here for. We’re here to investigate that,” said Lauren Bluestone, the Metro Animal Care and Control Director. A PetSmart employee sent PETA and Metro authorities photos and video of the animals, alleging they were sick and not cared for by the store. “These small animals, whether they’re reptiles, fish, hamsters, guinea pigs, they suffer the same as do dogs and cats, which most Americans are more familiar with and share their homes with,” said Dan Paden, a PETA representative. The popular pet store is under investigation by Metro police and the district attorney’s office for animal cruelty, and those agencies will decide whether any charges should be filed. “I shop here all the time. I won’t be shopping here now if this is the case,” said Brenda Post, a cat owner. “They have to have some type of evidence or else they wouldn’t have a raid.” Customers said they were surprised and shocked to hear about the allegations from the new store location. “That’s crazy. You wouldn’t think that there’d be such a big deal, but people really care about the animals which is great. It really makes me sad that that happened,” said Erica Van Tassel, a pet owner. PetSmart Senior Corporate Communications sent News 4 the following statement: \\"We are always committed to putting the needs of the pets in our care first.

MACC said it asked for PetSmart's policies on animal care. \\"Moving forward, we will use what we find today and work with Metro Law and the D.A.'s office to determine any potential charges,\\" MACC said in a statement.

Crematoria, known for its relentless heat during daytime, pitch-black darkness at night, and torturous living conditions, is built underground to offer prisoners a small degree of shelter from the harsh environment above. The prison's fortress-like structure is controlled by Warden Luna Stark (played by Helen Mirren), who rules with an iron fist. On a mission to uncover the truth behind Jack's puzzling connection with a rebellious group seeking to overthrow the Intergalactic Federation, investigative journalist Elara Matthews (played by Lupita Nyong'o) infiltrates Crematoria by posing as a nurse. She discovers that Jack has been framed for his crimes by a high-ranking Federation official, Victor Grayson (played by Idris Elba), who seeks to maintain the status quo and keep the truth hidden from the masses. As Elara delves deeper into the conspiracy, she knows she must break Jack out of Crematoria in order to expose Grayson and the Federation's crimes. Forming an alliance with a group of inmates, Jack and Elara devise a daring and near-impossible escape plan that will require them to orchestrate a riot, navigate treacherous underground tunnels, and utilize their individual strengths and skills to overcome the heavily fortified defenses of the prison.

What is the first name of the person that tries out his father's fishing rod? Answer the above question based on the context below: It's Christmas Eve and Richie Rich, the world's richest kid, is all excited to spend the day with his friends. While racing wildly with his friends in the snow, Richie's butler, Herbert Cadbury, controls the cars using a remote and guides the children back to Richie's house. He then reminds him about his responsibilities that are due to be executed on Christmas Eve, and instructs him to change his clothes and get ready for tea. Before going to do so, he visits his home scientist, Professor Keanbean, who shows him his recent invention, a wishing machine which works only on Christmas Eve. The day being that, Richie wishes for a \\"big pie\\" from it, and is given a \\"pig sty\\" instead. Cadbury is disgusted seeing this, and sends him off to change his clothes. He meets his parents, Richard and Regina Rich, to ask what they would like to have for Christmas. While with them, he also tries out his father's new fishing rod invented by Keanbean, which hooks on to a tuna sandwich in the vicinity. He then goes on to change his clothes. During tea, Richie meets his spoiled cousin, Reggie Van Dough, who wishes that he was as rich as Richie. Later, he dresses up like an elf with Cadbury as Santa Claus to distribute Christmas presents to the orphanage. While getting ready, Cadbury tells Richie about how he was a rock star in his youth days, in a band called Root Canal. When they take off in the sleigh with Richie driving it, Reggie takes control of it using the remote invented by Keanbean that Cadbury used earlier. He guides it through streets by shops, houses, and people, thus nearly destroying everything in the whole process.

In particular, this platform facilitates the exchange of ideas, discussions, and updates on current events. Celebrities use Twitter to engage with their fans, promote their work, and provide insights into their personal lives or opinions. In this article, we will explore how to follow a celebrity on Twitter effectively, analyzing the ways in which they utilize their accounts and how fans can enhance their own experience on the platform. 1. Follow the Celebrity on Twitter The first step in engaging with your favorite celebrity on Twitter is to follow them. To do this, search for their name or username in the search bar located at the top of the Twitter homepage. After locating their account, click the \\"follow\\" button next to their profile picture. This will ensure that their tweets appear in your feed, allowing you to stay up-to-date with their latest posts, comments, and interactions. 2. Analyze their Twitter usage Once you've followed a celebrity on Twitter, it's vital to observe and understand how they utilize the platform. Celebrities may use their accounts for various purposes, which can include: - Self-promotion: Many celebrities use Twitter to share updates on their professional lives, such as announcements about new projects or upcoming appearances. Keep an eye out for these tweets to remain informed about their latest endeavors. - Personal opinions: Some celebrities use Twitter to express their opinions on various subjects, ranging from popular culture and politics to environmental matters and philanthropy. Monitoring these tweets can help you better understand their values and beliefs. - Fan interaction: Celebrities may interact with their fans by replying to tweets, participating in live chats, or retweeting followers' content. Observe how the celebrity interacts with their fans, as this can serve as a model for your own engagement with them. - Trending topics: Celebrities often weigh in on trending topics, contributing their individual perspectives or responding to current events. Following celebrity discussions on these subjects can provide greater context or exposure to alternative viewpoints. 3. Engage with the Celebrity To maximize your experience on Twitter, consider engaging with the celebrity directly by liking, retweeting, or responding to their tweets. This can increase the likelihood of the celebrity noticing your account and potentially strengthening your connection with them. However, it's essential to maintain respectful boundaries while interacting with celebrities, refraining from excessively tagging or messaging them. 4. Create and Share Quality Content One way to further engage with celebrities on Twitter is by creating and sharing quality content that resonates with their interests or values. This may include fan art, well-informed opinions, or relevant articles. Curating high-quality content reflective of the celebrity's interests can increase your chances of receiving engagement from them in return. 5. Monitor the Celebrity's Team and Connections While following a celebrity, it might also be beneficial to pay attention to the people connected to them. This can include their management, personal relations, or other celebrities within their social circles. Keeping track of these individuals can provide additional insights and context about the celebrity's life, work, and values. Conclusion Twitter has introduced new opportunities for fans to connect with and follow their favorite celebrities in a manner that was once unattainable. By following a celebrity's account, monitoring their Twitter usage patterns, engaging with their content, sharing high-quality material, and staying informed about their professional circles, fans can gain a more comprehensive understanding of their idols while fostering stronger connections with them on the platform."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Clarity: The review is concise, straightforward, and gets to the point immediately. The reviewer effectively communicates that they liked the comparison used and the clear maps from the satellite. They have intentionally repeated the word \\"nice\\" to emphasize their satisfaction, which could indicate that the content exceeded their expectations. Rating: 5/5 2. Quality: The reviewer highlights the positive aspects of the content, specifically mentioning the \\"comparison\\" and \\"clear maps from satellite.\\" This indicates that they appreciate the effort put into the content, which could potentially include data visualization, images, or other relevant materials that contribute to the quality. Rating: 4/5 3. Informativeness: The review briefly refers to the comparison used and clear maps from the satellite, which gives potential users some idea of what the content offers. However, the review does not provide enough detail about what exactly was being compared, how the comparison was made, or the nature of the maps. Consequently, it could have been more informative and allowed readers to form a complete understanding of the content. Rating: 3/5 4. Subjectivity: The review focuses on the positive aspects of the content and is subjective in nature. This may indicate that the content may work well for some users but not for others.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: What happenens in the house Movie title: The Brotherhood Movie plot: A young American man arrives in Palermo by plane. A taxi driver at the airport immediately gets word to Frank Ginetta (Kirk Douglas), who hides, armed with a gun, until he realizes that the visitor he's been warned about is actually his kid brother, Vinnie (Alex Cord). Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea. Frank also dispenses justice on his own in the old Sicilian fashion, without seeking approval from the others. They, not being of Sicilian origin, are trying to leave behind the old traditional methods, such as when two of Frank's hit men kill a stool pigeon in the marshes and leave him tied to a chair with a canary stuffed in his mouth â as a warning to others who might talk too much. Frank still fondly remembers his father, who also was a mafioso who was assassinated in a hit. Vinnie is more of a businessman, and takes sides with the other board members in ventures they intend to pursue without his brother. Frank resents this, striking Vinnie for defying him and insisting to the board that Vinnie will have no part in what they have planned. Older members of the organization who are no longer involved in decision-making tell Frank that it was Dom... Answer:","completion":"The Brotherhood is a movie centered around a Mafia family and the relationship between two brothers, Frank and Vinnie Ginetta. The plot follows Frank, an old-school Mafioso who prefers traditional methods, as he navigates the changing world of organized crime along with his younger brother, Vinnie, who is more business-minded. When Vinnie arrives in Palermo, there is an initial suspicion that he might be sent by the mob to target Frank, but it turns out he is there as family. As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that there is a growing divide between Frank and the other Mafia leaders in the New York region, as they clash over differing ideas and methods. Frank is resistant to change and wants to maintain the old ways of doing things, whereas the majority of the board wants to leave those methods behind and modernize their operations. Vinnie finds himself siding with the board and getting caught in the middle of Frank's power struggle, leading to resentment and tension between the brothers. The older members of the organization who are no longer involved in decision-making warn Frank about potential threats to his leadership. The movie deals with themes of loyalty, betrayal, family dynamics, and the tension between tradition and modernization in the world of organized crime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Il est donc indispensable d'interdire fermement son usage chez toutes les bêtes destinées à la consommation humaine, et de surveiller toutes les importations de viande en provenance des pays tiers. Translate to English","completion":"This sentence in English translates to: \\"It is therefore essential to strictly prohibit its use in all animals destined for human consumption, and to monitor all meat imports from third countries.\\" When we break it down, we can further elaborate on the nuances and implications of this statement. The given phrase emphasizes a sense of necessity or urgency in implementing regulations related to the usage of something, possibly a substance or a procedure, in the farming of animals raised for meat. It may be talking about a harmful drug or a controversial farming method that poses health risks to consumers, ethical issues, or environmental concerns. The phrase highlights two key actions: prohibition and monitoring. The call for a firm prohibition suggests there is concern that using the unidentified substance or method could be harmful or risky if it continues - from either a human health perspective, an animal welfare perspective, or both. The strict ban underscores the importance of preventing the substance or method from being used in the first place. The reference to \\"third countries\\" suggests concerns about international standards and regulations. There is an explicit mention of monitoring all meat imports from these countries. This underscores the need for vigilance in food safety practices and points to a lack of confidence in the standards or oversight in these countries. It implies that the country where this is being enforced should not only concentrate on its internal agricultural practices but also pay attention to the global market. The focus on 'monitoring' underscores the need for an active approach to maintain food safety standards - this could involve regular inspections, stricter import regulations, or more thorough testing of imported meat products. In essence, reinventing food safety measures and ensuring rigorous implementation should be a priority to protect consumer health, maintain ethical livestock farming practices, and ensure highest food quality in the face of globalization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - magazines - phone book - carpeting - town - city The rationale to choose \\"carpeting\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Carpeting is the most appropriate choice when considering the items listed that would typically not be for sale in a bookstore. The rationale for choosing \\"carpeting\\" as the answer can be explained by examining each of the options provided: 1. Magazines: Magazines are often found in bookstores for sale. They cover a wide range of topics, such as current events, popular culture, science, history, and many more. Most bookstores stock their shelves with an extensive variety of magazines for browsing and purchasing. Therefore, magazines would not be an accurate answer because they are generally available for sale. 2. Phone book: While phone books may be found in some bookstores, they are generally not a focus for sales. Many bookstores may maintain a copy of a local phone book for reference purposes or provide them for free to customers; however, this answer does not completely rule out the sale of phone books, since specialized directories and address books are sometimes sold within a bookstore. Thus, the phone book option is less compelling than the carpeting option. 3. Carpeting: Most brick-and-mortar bookstores are furnished with carpeting to create a welcoming, comfortable, and quiet atmosphere. Carpeting absorbs sound, adds visual appeal, and can help keep the premises clean. However, carpeting in a bookstore serves a functional purpose and is not typically available for sale. It is a part of the store's infrastructure and decor rather than a product offering. This makes carpeting the most suitable answer to the given question. 4. Town and City: Both of these options are irrelevant to the context of a bookstore. A town and city are geographical locations or communities that encompass multiple businesses, residences, and other establishments. While bookstores may carry literature and guides about specific towns or cities, these locations themselves are not objects that can be purchased from a bookstore. In conclusion, carpeting is the most accurate answer to the question of what could be found in a bookstore that is not for sale. While the other options may be found within or related to a bookstore, they either represent typical sales items (magazines), do not categorically exclude being sold (phone book), or are entirely unrelated to the context of a bookstore (town and city). Carpeting, as a functional and non-sale element of a bookstore's environment, provides the most compelling rationale to be selected as the correct answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Big Boy's crime syndicate is aggressively taking over small businesses in the city. Detective Dick Tracy catches the urchin (who calls himself \\"Kid\\") in an act of petty theft. After rescuing him from a ruthless host, Tracy temporarily adopts him with the help of his girlfriend, Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly).

A series of interweaving stories tell the journey of a handgun — specifically, a .38 special revolver — as it passes from one owner to another. In all the time it passes between its various owners, it is never actually fired (aside from the one test-firing it underwent at the factory) and is never shown actually to discharge any ammunition.The opening credits run over scenes of the manufacture of the weapon. It is shipped to a gun store, where it is purchased by an older business owner whose home was recently burglarized. His wife is uncomfortable with the weapon in the house and convinces him to get rid of it. He gives it away to a security guard at his company, who pawns the gun. A young professional asks for a gun at the pawn shop. He is displeased when told there is a five-day waiting period required by law.

Movie title: Condemned to Live Movie plot: The film opens with a trio of explorers in Africa who are hiding in a cave. One of the explorers, a pregnant woman, is bitten by a vampire bat. The film then cuts forward in time to a small European village where a series of mysterious murders are taking place. The villagers readily assemble in mob form, with torches, at the house of Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) after every murder. The villagers suspect that a giant bat is to blame for the murders. Kristan gives the villagers advice on staying safe, and assures them a scientific explanation exists. However, in subsequent scenes, Kristan himself is revealed to be the murderer. He is seized by attacks (triggered by darkness) which transform him into a trance-like state of murderousness. After he commits a murder, he awakens from the trance with no memory of the deed, believing himself merely to have fainted. Kristan's obliviousness is further enabled by the intervention of his loyal hunchback Zan, the only person aware of Kristan's condition. Zan follows Kristan when he is in his trances, ensuring the professor is not discovered. An old friend of Kristan's named Dr. Bizet arrives to visit, and soon suspects what is happening. Bizet discloses to Kristan that his mother was bitten by a vampire bat, and that traits of vampirism have likely been passed down to him per Lamarckism. (The audience now understands the pregnant explorer in the opening flashback to have been Kristan's mother.) After Kristan's fiance (Maxine Doyle) is attacked by an entranced Kristan, the mob of villagers assumes Zan is culpable and chases him to the edge of a cliff inside a cave. Kristan arrives and confesses to the murders, despite Zan's protestations (aimed at saving the professor) that he, the hunchback, is in fact the murderer. As the mob watches, Kristan throws himself over the edge of the cliff and Zan follows.","completion":"Professor Kristan (Ralph Morgan) confessed to the murders."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Romans were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence.

To secure the frontier of his empire and the traffic on the trade routes to the east, Charlemagne allied with Khan Krum of Bulgaria and the Croatian duke Vojnomir, and from 791 launched several campaigns against the Avars, where he, according to the Vita Karoli Magni, encountered only modest opposition. In 796 Carolingian forces under Charlemagne's son Pepin of Italy destroyed the main Avar fortress called the Ring of the Avars and made the Khagan a Frankish vassal, while the remaining Avars retreated behind the Tisza River. The victory is perpetuated by the poem De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? make dandelion root tea","completion":"Absolutely, I would love to help you understand how to make dandelion root tea! Here's an easy explanation: 1. **Find some dandelions**: Dandelions are often seen as weeds, but did you know we can make tea from their roots? These are those yellow flowers you see in gardens or parks. Make sure they haven't been sprayed with any chemicals. 2. **Dig up the roots**: Ask an adult for help. With a small shovel, you can dig up the dandelion. The root is the part that's under the ground. It's long and looks a little bit like a thin carrot. 3. **Wash and chop**: The roots will be dirty, so you need to wash them really well. After they are clean, with the help of an adult, chop the roots into small pieces, kind of like cutting up vegetables for dinner. 4. **Dry the roots**: This can take some time. Spread out the chopped roots on a baking sheet and put them in a dry, warm place for about 2 weeks. They should feel hard and dry when they're ready, kind of like tiny pieces of wood. 5. **Roast the roots**: This step should definitely be done by an adult. They will put the pieces on a baking tray in the oven for about 2 hours. This will turn the roots into a dark brown color and give them a sweet scent. 6. **Make the tea**: Finally, the fun part! The adult can then put the roasted dandelion root pieces in a pot of boiling water. Let it simmer for about 10 minutes. The water will become a light brown color. 7. **Strain and enjoy**: Before you drink the tea, you need to use a strainer to catch the little pieces of root. This leaves you with only the liquid, the dandelion root tea, which you can drink! You can even add a bit of honey or a squeeze of lemon to taste, if you want. Remember, it's like telling a slow, careful story with each step. And no matter what, safety first. Always have an adult around to help."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal elements. Context: In March 1992, the band returned to the studio. With new songs written primarily on the road, the material has an overall darker feel than Facelift, with six of the album's thirteen songs dealing with the subject of addiction. \\"We did a lot of soul searching on this album. There's a lot of intense feelings.\\" Cantrell said, \\"We deal with our daily demons through music. All of the poison that builds up during the day we cleanse when we play\\". On September 29, 1992, Alice in Chains released its second album, Dirt. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 and since its release has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, making Dirt the band's highest selling album to date. The album was a critical success, with Steve Huey of Allmusic praising the album as a \\"major artistic statement, and the closest they ever came to recording a flat-out masterpiece\\". Chris Gill of Guitar World called Dirt \\"huge and foreboding, yet eerie and intimate\\", and \\"sublimely dark and brutally honest\\". Dirt spawned five top 30 singles, \\"Would?\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Angry Chair\\", and \\"Down in a Hole\\", and remained on the charts for nearly two years. Alice in Chains was added as openers to Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tours tour. Days before the tour began, Layne Staley broke his foot in an ATV accident, forcing him to use crutches on stage. Starr left the band shortly after the Hollywood Rock concert in Rio de Janeiro in January 1993, stating that he wanted to spend more time with his family. Staley told Rolling Stone in 1994 about Starr leaving the band, \\"It was just a difference in priorities. We wanted to continue intense touring and press. Mike was ready to go home.\\" Years later, Starr claimed that he was fired due to his drug addiction. Starr was replaced by former Ozzy Osbourne bassist Mike Inez. In 1993, the band recorded two songs with Inez, \\"What the Hell Have I\\" and \\"A Little Bitter\\", for the Last Action Hero soundtrack. During the summer of 1993, Alice in Chains toured with the alternative music festival Lollapalooza, their last major tour with Staley. Question: Did it reach bill board charts>? Answer:","completion":"Yes, Alice in Chains' second album, Dirt, released on September 29, 1992, was successful in reaching the Billboard charts. The album peaked at number six on the Billboard 200 chart, a notable accomplishment for the band. Since its release, Dirt has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA, making it the band's highest-selling album to date. Additionally, the album produced five top 30 singles, specifically \\"Would?\\", \\"Rooster\\", \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Angry Chair\\", and \\"Down in a Hole,\\" further solidifying its impact on the charts and the band's success.

Though he is injured, he crawls back to the car, and sees that his little baby boy in the back is okay. When the police arrive, Adam Mitchell and Shane Fuller meet Hayes, discovering he is a new deputy, having recently moved. The personal lives of these officers are observed: Mitchell adores his nine-year-old daughter, Emily, but is distant from his fifteen-year-old son, Dylan, because Mitchell doesn't share Dylan's interest in 5k runs. Hayes never knew his biological father, instead treating a neighbor as his father (even giving him Father's Day cards annually), but would risk his life to save his three children; however, his teenage daughter Jade (Taylor Hutcherson), resents him because he has a strict policy about dating.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Two groups of patients were under observation for heart disease. The Red group was composed of people with low cholesterol, while the Yellow group was comprised of people with very high cholesterol. Which group had more people with high blood pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, one could infer that the Yellow group, comprised of people with very high cholesterol, had more people with high blood pressure. This inference is drawn from the fact that high cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades and is a major contributing factor to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a condition where cholesterol, along with other materials, are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall, leading to the formation of plaques. These plaques can consequently restrict or block the flow of blood through the blood vessels. As a result, a decrease in blood flow could lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In situations where there is a complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart, it can result in a heart attack, causing significant damage from oxygen deprivation, and in some cases, even death. Since the Yellow group consists of people with very high cholesterol, it is reasonable to assume that this group would have a higher rate of atherosclerosis development and thus, higher incidences of high blood pressure compared to the Red group, which is composed of people with low cholesterol. However, it is essential to take into consideration other factors such as age, lifestyle choices, family history, and medical conditions when examining the relationship between cholesterol and high blood pressure. In summary, the Yellow group, with very high cholesterol levels, is more likely to have a higher number of people with high blood pressure due to the increased risk of atherosclerosis development. However, it is important to remember that there are other factors at play in determining an individual's risk of high blood pressure and heart disease."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select from: (a). negative (b). positive","completion":"To predict the sentiment of this tweet, let's analyze it step-by-step. Step 1: Identify sentiment-indicating words or phrases - love: This expression indicates a positive feeling. - hate: This expression indicates a negative feeling. - annoying: This adjective has a negative connotation. Step 2: Determine the context of the sentiment-indicating words or phrases - \\"i love you\\": Directed towards @terruh, shows affection, suggesting a positive sentiment. - \\"I hate annoying high schoolers\\": Shows dislike or frustration towards a group of people, suggesting a negative sentiment. Step 3: Weigh the sentiment-indicating words or phrases As there are both positive (love) and negative (hate, annoying) sentiments expressed, we will weigh them based on intensity and relevance. - Love (positive) has a more direct and intimate connotation as it is directed towards a specific person (@terruh). - Hate (negative), combined with annoying (negative), targets a general group of people (high schoolers). Based on the analysis, we can conclude: The tweet has a mix of sentiments - a positive sentiment towards @terruh, and a negative sentiment towards high schoolers. However, the expression of love towards a specific individual (@terruh) holds more weight than the general negative sentiment.

Where in a metropolitan area would you likely find a dance club? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options： A. downtown area B. city hall C. toun D. united states E. downtown district A:","completion":"A. Downtown Area In a metropolitan area, you would most likely find a dance club in the downtown area. The downtown area is typically characterized by a high concentration of business, retail, dining, and entertainment establishments, making it an ideal location for a dance club. Dance clubs tend to attract a diverse crowd and rely on the density of people looking to socialize, have fun, and enjoy nightlife options. Several factors contribute to the downtown area being the most suitable location for a dance club: 1. Accessibility: Downtown areas have good transportation options, such as public transit, buses, trains, and taxi services. People attending dance clubs often prefer to avoid driving to enjoy events without worrying about parking and drink-and-drive-related issues. 2. Visibility: Dance clubs thrive on the vibrant nightlife and foot traffic typically found in downtown areas. High visibility ensures that potential patrons are aware of the club and contributing to its popularity. 3. Synergy with other establishments: A downtown area usually has a variety of bars, restaurants, and entertainment options. People often visit multiple venues during a night out, so having a dance club in close proximity to other nightlife establishments increases the chances that patrons will visit the club. 4. Population density: Downtown areas generally have a high concentration of people living, working, and visiting throughout the day. This density is especially important for attracting a diverse and vibrant clientele who might be interested in attending dance club events. 5. Late-night operations: Dance clubs often operate late into the night, which can be disruptive to residential areas. The downtown area, on the other hand, is usually a hub of activity, and the presence of other businesses and nightlife options limits the impact that a dance club's noise and crowd might have on its surroundings. In conclusion, it is the availability of good infrastructure, a vibrant crowd, and synergy with other establishments that make the downtown area the most suitable location for a dance club in a metropolitan area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This river is next to Hilda's farm that she has lived on for decades. Ever since she was a child, she was taught that it's important to dump excess fertilizer into the river. So, that's what she does whenever she has leftover fertilizer she isn't going to use. The Dundrin Ocean is connected to many rivers. However, these rivers are located primarily in uninhabited and natural areas of the world. There is one farm near the Dundrin, though, which is owned by Luke.

Hilda and Luke are both farmers who are situated near bodies of water that eventually connect to oceans - Hilda near a river linked to the Malegese Ocean, and Luke near various rivers that flow into the Dundrin Ocean. 2. As both are engaged in farming activities, it can be assumed they utilize fertilizers in their work, substances known to contribute to marine pollution when they enter bodies of water. 3. Hilda, following her childhood teachings, dumps excess fertilizer into the river. These substances are then carried by the river into the Malegese Ocean, contributing to its pollution by releasing potentially hazardous chemicals. This can lead to marine issues such as hypoxia and dead zones. 4. On the other hand, the Dundrin Ocean is connected to rivers located in uninhabited and natural areas - implying less human activity and therefore, less possibility of pollution from human activities. Luke, the one human actor we know is near these rivers, specifically avoids disposing of his garbage and excess fertilizer in a way which would contaminate the rivers. He either stores his excess fertilizer for future use or disposes of it properly, showing a conscious effort to prevent contributing to marine pollution. 5. Therefore, considering their respective practices, we can conclude that Luke is causing less marine pollution compared to Hilda."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, I would say \\"Not at all\\" in recommending this app to a friend. The reasoning behind this answer can be broken down into several key points: 1. Compatibility Issues: The review explicitly mentions that the app is crashing on Android Nougat (Android 7), which indicates potential compatibility issues. As a user, you would want an app that runs smoothly on different versions of the operating system to ensure a seamless experience across devices. 2. Reliability and Stability: The app appears to be crashing regularly, suggesting a lack of stability and reliability in its performance. This is a critical factor when considering an app, as users expect a smooth and uninterrupted experience. Crashing can lead to frustration and ultimately discourages users from continuing to use the app. 3. User Interface and Experience: The review states that \\"tapping set wallpaper just takes you back to the activate screen and on and on.\\" This suggests a subpar user interface and experience, as users may become confused and frustrated by the app's lack of expected functionality. A well-designed app should have a clear, user-friendly interface that enables users to efficiently navigate and utilize the app's features. 4. Negative Word of Mouth: Given the negative experience detailed in the review, it is likely that the user would not recommend this app to their friends or colleagues. In the age of social media and online reviews, negative word of mouth can have a significant impact on an app's reputation and ultimately its user base. As a friend, you would want to recommend apps that have a positive impact on others and provide a quality user experience. In conclusion, taking into consideration the compatibility issues, lack of reliability and stability, poor user interface and experience, and potential negative word of mouth, I would not recommend this app to a friend at all. It is essential to prioritize user satisfaction and ensure an app is capable of meeting the needs and expectations of its target audience before recommending it to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today is Sunday. I have a walk with my grandmother in the park. My grandmother is 80 years old and she can't see well. After some time, my grandmother is tired , so she sits down on a chair. There is another person sitting on the chair, too. \\"Hello,\\" my grandmother says to the person with long hair next to her. \\"Can you see the girl with long hair under the big tree?\\"\\"The girl?\\" says the person, \\"No, he's my brother Mike.\\" \\"Oh, sorry. I don't know you are his sister.\\" Says my grandmother. \\"No, I'm not his sister, I'm his brother!\\" Why does the writer's grandmother think the person next to her is a girl? A) Because he has long hair. B) Because he walks like a girl. C) Because he speaks like a girl. D) Because he wears girls' clothes Answer:","completion":"A) Because he has long hair. In the given scenario, the writer's grandmother is an elderly woman who cannot see well. As she sits down and starts a conversation with the person next to her, she quickly assumes that the person is a girl based on their long hair. Apart from the long hair, there isn't any mention of the person's way of walking, speaking, or choice of clothing being similar to that of a girl's. In many cultures and societies, long hair is often stereotypically associated with women, while short hair is typically linked to men. However, this isn't universally valid, and individuals across the gender spectrum might have varying hair lengths to suit their preferences and personal styles. In this case, the writer's grandmother mistakenly assumes that the person with long hair is a girl, primarily based on this stereotype. The person with long hair corrects the grandmother by informing her that the person under the tree is not a girl, but rather their brother, Mike. Further, when the grandmother assumes the person she is talking to is the sister, they clarify that they are, in fact, also a brother. This highlights how relying solely on superficial aspects such as hair length can lead to misinterpretations and incorrect assumptions about someone's gender."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Question: Where did the farmer send the heifer to make money when she was no longer useful to the farm? Options: - sanctuary farm - cow pasture - countryside - cattle ranch - slaughterhouse Explain why a human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","completion":"Slaughterhouse A human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most logical option among the given choices, considering the context provided. When the heifer is no longer useful to the farm, it implies that she can no longer provide services or financial benefits in terms of milk production, breeding, or labor. Thus, the farmer would seek alternative means to make money from the heifer. Here's a brief analysis of the options to better understand why \\"slaughterhouse\\" is the most appropriate choice: 1. Sanctuary farm: Sanctuary farms primarily serve as safe havens for animals, where they are not exploited for profit. They rescue and provide a home for injured or abused animals. In this case, the farmer is looking to make money from the heifer, which wouldn't happen at a sanctuary farm. 2. Cow pasture: A cow pasture is just a grazing area for cows to feed on grass or hay. While the heifer could still graze in a pasture, this would not generate any income for the farmer when she's deemed \\"no longer useful\\" to the farm operation-wise. 3. Countryside: The countryside refers to the rural areas outside urban settings. Simply sending the heifer to the countryside would not guarantee any financial gain for the farmer, as it would probably live freely, without any sale or productive purpose. 4. Cattle ranch: A cattle ranch primarily focuses on breeding and raising cattle for various agricultural purposes. In the given context, the farmer has already deemed the heifer no longer useful; hence, it would not contribute significantly to the cattle ranch operations or the farmer's financial objectives. 5. Slaughterhouse: A slaughterhouse is a facility where animals are processed and turned into meat products. When the heifer is no longer useful to the farm in other aspects, the farmer could sell the heifer to a slaughterhouse to make money from the sale of meat and other byproducts, such as leather and bones. This option directly fulfills the farmer's intention of generating income from the heifer in an alternative way. Therefore, given these explanations, a human would choose \\"slaughterhouse\\" as the most appropriate answer to the question because it aligns with the objective of making money from the heifer when she no longer serves her original purpose on the farm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Amid the warm waters of the Blue Lagoon spa in a lava field in south-west Iceland, Lee Cattermole relaxes and reflects with his girlfriend. Three years ago, it was he who was erupting, the then Sunderland captain arrested and later accepting a police caution for damaging five vehicles in Newcastle during a night out with team-mates. Earlier that day, Martin O’Neill had been confirmed as his new manager; it was hardly Cattermole’s wisest move and merely served to vandalise his own character. Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole insists he has calmed down from the unpredictable player he once was. Gus Poyet readily admits Cattermole is among the first names on his Sunderland team sheet. Current Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was certainly sceptical upon his arrival one year ago. ‘If somebody tells me this guy is a b*****d and I need to be careful, then I will be. I was told he was impossible to control, that he will get sent off a hundred times and he will let you down,’ says Poyet. ‘I was told he could not play football like I want to. I was told he was training on his own away from everybody else. I thought I’d meet Lee and he’d have a gun and he’d shoot me in the head.’ Twelve months on and Poyet readily admits that Cattermole is the first name on his team sheet. The 26-year-old has just been voted North East Football Writers’ Player of 2014 and the manager is backing his on-field lieutenant for an England call-up — ‘In Uruguay, he would be the hero, the captain,’ he says. The respect is mutual. Cattermole says he has come a long way in 12 months under Poyet. ‘In the last year I have learned a hell of a lot,’ says the anchorman. Poyet took over as manager of Sunderland in October 2013 and continues to work with Cattermole. ‘Gus coming in has been a massive factor in winning the award, which I’m chuffed about. Gus is very much my kind of person, very English minded. ‘It is totally different playing under Gus than any other manager. I think he played street football a lot more. He almost taught himself, which is why he was a very natural player. ‘And he has told me in no uncertain terms that, in the position I play, if I don’t do what he wants then I won’t play. On and off the pitch this is as good as I have ever felt. The manager has stuck with me.’ As Cattermole suggests, off the pitch was a big issue — there was a three-year ban from pubs in his hometown of Stockton in 2008. ‘I have calmed down off the pitch as well as on it,’ he says. ‘I had a couple of incidents during my career which people have read too much into. ‘I have just matured and I even have a girlfriend now. When anyone is 26 they look back to when they were 18 and there is a world of difference — and I am no different.’ Indeed, pubs have made way for geothermal spas and romantic getaways in Nordic lava land. Cattermole — and Poyet — will be hoping his days of boiling over are a thing of the past. Cattermole says he has 'matured' at Sunderland and puts it in no small way down to Poyet's management.","completion":"The article highlights Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole's transformation under manager Gus Poyet, showcasing how he has evolved from an unpredictable, troubled player to one of the first names on the team sheet. It recounts an incident from three years ago, where Cattermole was arrested for damaging vehicles during a night out after the confirmation of Martin O'Neill as his manager. However, his turnaround is evident from the fact that he was voted North East Football Writers' Player of 2014, and Poyet even backs him for an England call-up. Cattermole credits his growth to Poyet, saying that he has learned a lot under his management, both on and off the field. He describes Poyet's influence as a \\"massive factor\\" in winning the award, calling him very \\"English-minded,\\" and notes that playing under Poyet is a completely different experience compared to other managers. Cattermole mentions how Poyet has instilled discipline in him as well, stating that if he does not do what Poyet wants in his playing position, he will not play. As for his personal life, Cattermole acknowledges his past off-field problems, such as a three-year ban from pubs in his hometown in 2008, but shares that he has calmed down and matured since then. According to him, people have read too much into his past incidents, but as a 26-year-old now, he sees a world of difference in his behavior compared to when he was 18, even having a girlfriend currently. The article concludes with a reflection on how Cattermole's troubled days seem to be in the past, with romantic getaways to places like the Blue Lagoon spa in Iceland replacing nights out at pubs, alluding to the positive difference Gus Poyet's management has made in his life and career."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As he and his men ride away from their latest visit, Calvera promises to return to loot the village again. Taking what meager goods they have, the village leaders ride to a town just inside the United States hoping to barter for weapons to defend themselves. While there, they encounter Chris Adams (Yul Brynner), a veteran Cajun gunslinger. After listening to their tale, Chris suggests that the village hire gunfighters, which would be cheaper than guns and ammunition. The village men relentlessly try to convince him to be their gunman. At first he agrees only to help them find men, but later he decides to recruit six other men to help him defend the village, despite the poor pay offered. The other men include hotheaded, inexperienced Chico (Horst Buchholz); Chris's friend Harry Luck (Brad Dexter), who believes Chris is seeking treasure; the drifter Vin Tanner (Steve McQueen), who has gone broke after a round of gambling and is loath to accept a position as a store clerk; Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), a gunfighter of Irish-Mexican heritage who has fallen on hard times; a cowboy, Britt (James Coburn), interested only in further perfecting his already high skills in both knife and gun, who joins purely for the challenge involved to test those skills; and an on-the-run gunman Lee (Robert Vaughn) struggling with a crisis of confidence.

It focuses on Charlie, a roguish handsome German Shepard who may seem unlikable to some at first... but eventually will win you over.Not a kiddie film by any means. Often very dark and frightening at times. A treat for Don Bluth fans and animation buffs. But do keep a tissue in handy. ADGTH never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are movie sensitive. Arguably one of the greatest non-Disney animated films of all time. Along with Watership Down and My Neighbor Totoro.BOTTOM LINE: A heavenly masterpiece. A:","completion":"Based on the content of this movie review, it can be classified as a positive review.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are it would become less dense or it would become more dense ): What would happen to the atmosphere as Jim climbed lower down a mountain it would become less dense or it would become more dense? A:","completion":"As Jim climbed lower down a mountain, the atmosphere would become more dense. To explain this in detail, let's first understand the composition and structure of Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere is a mixture of various gases that surround the Earth, held in place by gravity. It consists primarily of nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), and other trace gases such as argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. The atmosphere is divided into layers based on temperature and pressure variations. These layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer, extending to an altitude of approximately 7 to 20 kilometers (4 to 12 miles) above sea level, depending on the location and time of year. This is the layer where weather and human activities primarily occur. Air pressure and density are related to altitude. At higher altitudes, the air pressure and density decrease due to the lesser volume of air above that point. This is because the Earth's gravitational force is weaker at greater distances from the surface, which causes the atmosphere to expand and become less dense. As you go further up in the atmosphere – that is, as you increase in altitude – the density of the atmosphere decreases, leading to thinner air that contains fewer air molecules. Now, consider Jim's situation, in which he is climbing down a mountain. As he descends, he is moving towards a lower altitude, closer to the Earth's surface. Consequently, the air pressure increases, as there is a larger volume of air above him. This leads to a denser atmosphere, with more air molecules per unit volume. In conclusion, as Jim climbs lower down a mountain, the atmosphere would become more dense due to the increase in air pressure and the greater volume of air above him. This has significant implications for various factors such as temperature, weather conditions, and human physical capacities at different altitudes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A former Goldman Sachs trader angry that he got a bonus of only 8.25 million has gone to court to get the millions of dollars that he says his bosses still owe him. Deeb Amin Salem, 35, claims he helped Goldman Sachs make billions of dollars in profits by betting against the mortgage market and he expected a bonus of roughly 13 million for 2010, Bloomberg News reported. Salem says that Goldman Sachs executives shortchanged him because he had discussed the firm’s lucrative mortgage-hedging bets in writing and his comments became the focus of ire in the U.S. Senate, according to Manhattan Supreme Court papers filed last week. As a result, Goldman Sachs was deeply embarrassed. Salem had earned a 15 million bonus in 2009 and had told his mother after her house burned down on Christmas 2010 that she shouldn’t worry because he was expecting 13 million, Bloomberg reported. Salem left Goldman Sachs in 2012 after his 2011 bonus dropped to 3 million and then challenged his bosses’ 2010 bonus decision by asking for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to arbitrate the dispute.

They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Cancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band. The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows. On June 2, 2006, the band took part in a short interview and then played a free CD release show at The Edge 102.1 (CFNY-FM) and then on June 6 Birthing the Giant was released into major record stores.

Middle Ages Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: I teach geography at UNLV three times per week. Last Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then asked me why I always seemed to be so cheerful. \\"I choose to be cheerful.\\" I said. Then I told them a story. In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college. As soon as I got there I called AAA and arranged for a tow truck to meet me at my car after class. The secretary in the office asked me what had happened. \\"This is my lucky day.\\" I replied, smiling. \\"Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?\\" She was puzzled. \\"What do you mean?\\" \\"My car could have broken down anywhere along the freeway but it didn't.\\" I replied, \\"Instead, it broke down in the perfect place: off the freeway, within walking distance from here. I'm still able to teach my class, and I've been able to arrange for the tow truck to meet me after class.\\" The secretary's eyes opened wide, and then she smiled. I smiled back and headed for class.

Millions of men and women readied themselves for work. Some made their way to the Twin Towers, the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Others went to Arlington, Virginia, to the Pentagon. Across the Potomac River, the United States Congress was back in session. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, people began to line up for a White House tour. In Sarasota, Florida, President George W. Bush went for an early morning run. For those heading to an airport, weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey. Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari, who arrived at the airport in Portland, Maine. Boston: American 11 and United 175. Atta and Omari boarded a 6:00 A.M. flight from Portland to Boston's Logan International Airport. When he checked in for his flight to Boston, Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS (Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System), created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures. Under security rules in place at the time, the only consequence of Atta's selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft. This did not hinder Atta's plans. Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at 6:45. Seven minutes later, Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi, a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport. They spoke for three minutes. It would be their final conversation.

Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Question: What is the beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool hospital and Gaza? Options: A: A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital. B: The Shifa imported medical machines from UK.

The contractor wanted to build a new building on the land but the Pick from: + land was too small. + building was too small.","completion":"The contractor wanted to build a new building on the land, but the land was too small. Despite the limited space, the contractor was determined to make the best use of the available area. He called for a meeting with his team of architects and engineers to brainstorm possible solutions. As the team gathered around the conference table, they explored various ideas to maximize space usage. One architect suggested building taller structures to add more stories, increasing the number of occupiable units. Another engineer put forth the idea of creating an underground parking system, freeing up valuable real estate for the actual building itself. During the discussions, a junior engineer proposed a novel concept that piqued everyone's interest. He suggested designing a mixed-use building, combining residential and commercial use in the same structure. By doing so, they could generate more income for the client, and it would be quite attractive to potential investors. The contractor was intrigued by the idea and asked the team to research and develop detailed plans. As they delved deeper into the mixed-use concept, they realized that the land's strategic location was perfect for this kind of development. It was close to a busy commercial hub and a burgeoning residential community. In addition, the area had easy access to public transportation, making it even more desirable for potential occupants. The team of architects and engineers began working tirelessly on drafting the plans. They incorporated energy-efficient techniques into the building's design, aiming for it to be environmentally sustainable. They decided to use materials like cross-laminated timber, known for its strength and low carbon footprint. The building would also have green features like a rooftop garden and rainwater harvesting system. The team carefully considered the needs of future occupants. In the residential section, they designed multi-bedroom units for families, as well as smaller, one-bedroom apartments for single occupants and couples. There would be ample green spaces throughout the development, with walking and biking trails, playgrounds, and a shared community garden. The commercial section of the building would accommodate shops, cafes, and restaurants on the ground floor, allowing both residents and visitors easy access to retail and dining options. The building would also house offices and co-working spaces, as well as conference rooms and shared amenities. With the final plans in place, the contractor excitedly presented the proposal to the client, who was thrilled by the thought of such an innovative and profitable project. Since the mixed-use building proposal addressed the limitations imposed by the small size of the land, the client readily agreed to move forward with construction. During the building process, the contractor and his team regularly collaborated with the local authorities to ensure all zoning regulations and building codes were being met. As a result, the construction proceeded smoothly and on schedule, leading to the completion of the project within the stipulated time and budget. In the end, the contractor's determination to overcome the challenges posed by the small piece of land resulted in a cutting-edge, mixed-use building that significantly enhanced the neighborhood's appeal. It provided a dynamic and sustainable living environment for residents and supported the local economy through commercial establishments. The project's success cemented the contractor's reputation in the industry, as clients flocked to him for innovative solutions to their own development challenges. Meanwhile, the junior engineer's career took off, thanks to his groundbreaking idea that turned a limitation into an opportunity. The mixed-use building became a source of inspiration, serving as a model for sustainable urban construction in densely populated areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: Where does the painting that not get distribution of reproductions reside today? from the following article ? Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains.","completion":"The painting \\"Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed\\" by William Etty, which did not have reproductions distributed, resides in the Tate Gallery.

It is evident that the reviewer appreciates certain aspects of the film while expressing dissatisfaction with others. On the flattering side, the review highlights the good acting and the impressive action sequences (referred to as \\"shoot-em-up specials\\"). These positive remarks reflect the reviewer's appreciation for the performance of the actors and the thrilling, adrenaline-pumping scenes that are often a major draw for film enthusiasts. Such feedback can attract potential viewers who enjoy quality acting and captivating action. The reviewer also acknowledges the film's narrative and plot but uses terms like \\"a little disjointed\\" and \\"ok\\" to describe it. This mirrors a lukewarm response to the structure of the story, which could be perceived as neither overwhelmingly negative nor strongly positive. It might indicate that the film does not excel in this area but also does not fail to deliver a decent story. As for the unflattering aspects, the review mentions certain discrepancies between the theatrical release and the DVD version, suggesting that some aspects of the film may have been lost or altered during the transition. This can potentially raise concerns for potential viewers who might be interested in experiencing the original and complete version of the film. Furthermore, the reviewer expresses disappointment in the lack of personal story development between the lead actors. It implies that the film might miss out on opportunities to delve deeper into the characters' relationships, which could have added depth, layers, and emotional engagement for the audience. In conclusion, the review for \\"Bandkok Love Story\\" generally contains a blend of both complimentary and critical remarks, with the positive comments mostly focusing on the acting and action sequences, and the negative points addressing the plot and personal story development. Overall, however, the review leans slightly towards an unflattering light due to the dissatisfaction expressed towards the story and character relationships, along with the concerns related to differences between the theatrical and DVD releases. As a potential viewer, one must weigh in these factors and decide if the captivating acting and action scenes are enough to make up for the cited shortcomings in the story and characters' development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on earlier transmitted reports, in the year 632, after the demise of Muhammad a number of his companions who knew the Quran by heart were killed in a battle by Musaylimah, the first caliph Abu Bakr (d. 634) decided to collect the book in one volume so that it could be preserved. Zayd ibn Thabit (d. 655) was the person to collect the Quran since \\"he used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah's Apostle\\". Thus, a group of scribes, most importantly Zayd, collected the verses and produced a hand-written manuscript of the complete book. The manuscript according to Zayd remained with Abu Bakr until he died. Zayd's reaction to the task and the difficulties in collecting the Quranic material from parchments, palm-leaf stalks, thin stones and from men who knew it by heart is recorded in earlier narratives. After Abu Bakr, Hafsa bint Umar, Muhammad's widow, was entrusted with the manuscript. In about 650, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (d. 656) began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd to use Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Quran. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed. The present form of the Quran text is accepted by Muslim scholars to be the original version compiled by Abu Bakr.

But robins are in danger of wearing themselves out by singing too much. Robins are singing all nightas well as during the day, British-based researchers say. David Dominoni, of Glasgow University, said that light from street lamps, takeaway signs and homes is affecting the birds' biological clock, leading to them being wide awake when they should be asleep. Dr Dominoni, who is putting cameras inside nesting boxes to track sleeping patterns, said lack of sleep could put the birds' health at risk. His study shows that when robins are exposed to light at night in the lab, it leads to some genes being active at the wrong time of day. And the more birds are exposed to light, the more active they are at night. He told people at a conference, \\"There have been a couple of studies suggesting they are increasing their song output at night and during the day they are still singing. Singing is a costly behaviour and it takes energy. So by increasing their song output, there might be some costs of energy.\\" And it is not just robins that are being kept awake by artificial light. Blackoiids and seagulls are also being more nocturnal. Dr Dominoni said, \\"In Glasgow where I live, gulls are a serious problem. I have people coming to me saying \`You are the bird expert. Can you help us kill these gulls?'.During the breeding season, between April and June, they are very active at night and very noisy and people can't sleep.\\" Although Dr Dominoni has only studied light pollution, other research concluded that robins living in noisy cities have started to sing at night to make themselves heard over loud noise. However, some birds thrive in noisy environments. A study from California Polytechnic University found more hummingbirds in areas with heavy industrial machinery. It is thought that they are capitalising on their predators fleeing to quieter areas. According to Dr Dominoni's study, what cause robins to sing so much? A) The breeding season. B) The light in modern C) The dangerous environment. D) The noise from heavy machinery. A:","completion":"According to Dr. Dominoni's study, the cause for robins to sing so much is B) The light in modern environments, specifically from street lamps, takeaway signs, and homes. This artificial light affects the birds' biological clock, leading them to be awake and more active when they should be asleep, increasing their song output at night and during the day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The Treasury bailed out the bank by buying a 72% stake for £45bn, at 502p a share, at the height of the financial crisis in 2008. Shares in the loss-making lender are now trading at less than half that price at 223p. Philip Hammond told MPs on Tuesday: \\"We have to live in the real world.\\" He added: \\"Our policy remains to return the bank to private hands as soon as we can achieve fair value for the shares, recognising that fair value could well be below what the previous government paid for them. \\"We have to live in the real world and make decisions on the future of our holding in RBS in the best interests of taxpayers.\\" Simon Jack: Why is RBS still losing money? Mr Hammond has previously said the government did not expect to offload its stake in RBS until after 2020. He added: \\"We are making real progress in realising our holdings in the banking sector. \\"We continue the programme sale of our shareholding in Lloyds, which is now down from 43% to less than 2%, and just last month we sold £12bn worth of Bradford & Bingley mortgages in a highly competitive process.\\" It is understood that the Treasury will only start to sell its shares in RBS when \\"legacy\\" issues have been resolved. Those issues include a potentially huge fine by the US Department of Justice, which is pursuing the bank over the sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis. In February, RBS posted its ninth consecutive annual loss, with much of the £7bn accounted for by setting aside £5.9bn for fines and legal costs. The bank has racked up losses of more than £50bn since the government bailout. Chief executive Ross McEwan said in Feburary he expected RBS to return to profit by the end of 2018. When one-off charges were stripped out, the core business of the bank was making money, he added. The European Commission is examining government proposals that aim to spare RBS from being forced to sell off the Williams & Glyn branch network.

The Steelers wasted no time getting the early lead when on the opening kickoff, Mewelde Moore handed the ball off to rookie wide receiver Antonio Brown, who returned it 89&#160;yards for a touchdown. Tennessee would cut the lead when Rob Bironas nailed a 21-yard field goal. Throughout the rest of the game, Pittsburgh scored steadily with kicker Jeff Reed, who hit field goals of 36, 34, 25, and 27&#160;yards, putting the Steelers up 19-3. The Titans finally scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter with a Kerry Collins 2-yard pass to former Steeler Nate Washington, and successfully converted the 2-point conversion and onside kick necessary to give themselves the chance to tie the game on the final drive. However, Pittsburgh's defense was able to stop Chris Johnson on a reception as the clock ran out, sealing the victory. Starting quarterback Dennis Dixon sprained his left knee during the second quarter and was replaced by Charlie Batch, but the Steelers defense swarmed the Titans, coming up with four sacks and forcing seven turnovers, the most by Tennessee since 2000. The Titans pulled their starting QB, Vince Young, after his third turnover. After replacing Young, Kerry Collins had two turnovers of his own. Pittsburgh also ended Tennessee running back Chris Johnson's 100-yard rushing streak at 12 games.

In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization.

Celine Marie Claudette Dion, ChLD (; French: [selin djo]; born 30 March 1968) is a Canadian singer. Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband Rene Angelil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. Dion first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland. Dion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, the youngest of 14 children of Therese (nee Tanguay), a homemaker, and Adhemar Dion, a butcher, both of French-Canadian descent. Dion was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor, but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne. Music had always been a major part of the Dion family; indeed, Dion herself was named after the song \\"Celine,\\" which French singer Hugues Aufray had recorded two years before her own birth. On 13 August 1973, at the age of five, the young Celine made her first public appearance at her brother Michel's wedding, where she performed Christine Charbonneau's song \\"Du fil des aiguilles et du coton\\". She continued to perform with her siblings in her parents' small piano bar called Le Vieux Baril, \\"The Old Barrel.\\" From an early age, Dion had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with People magazine, she recalled, \\"I missed my family and my home, but I don't regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.\\" At age 12, Dion collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to write and compose her first song, \\"Ce n'etait qu'un reve,\\" whose title translates as \\"It Was Only a Dream\\" or \\"Nothing But A Dream.\\" Her brother Michel sent the recording to music manager Rene Angelil, whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album. Angelil was moved to tears by Dion's voice and decided to make her a star. In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, La voix du bon Dieu, which later became a local No. 1 hit and made Dion an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan, and won the musician's award for \\"Top Performer\\" as well as the gold medal for \\"Best Song\\" with \\"Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi\\". By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single \\"D'amour ou d'amitie\\" (\\"Of Love or of Friendship\\"), Dion had also won several Felix Awards, including \\"Best Female performer\\" and \\"Discovery of the Year\\". Further success came when Dion represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Ne partez pas sans moi\\" and won the contest by a close margin in Dublin, Ireland. At age eighteen, after seeing a Michael Jackson performance, Dion told Angelil that she wanted to be a star like Jackson. Though confident in her talent, Angelil realized that her image needed to be changed in order for her to be marketed worldwide. Dion receded from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the Ecole Berlitz in 1989 to polish her English. In 1989, during a concert on the Incognito Tour, Dion injured her voice. She consulted the otorhinolaryngologist William Gould, who gave her an ultimatum: have immediate surgery on her vocal cords or do not utilize them at all for three weeks. Dion chose the latter and underwent vocal training with William Riley.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: When did she begin music?","completion":"Celine Dion began her music journey at a very young age.

For further clarification, let's break the sentence down a bit: 1. \\"Grabado al Aguafuerte y acuatinta\\" translates to \\"etching and aquatint engraving\\". Etching is a printmaking technique that uses chemicals, usually acid, to cut into the unprotected areas of a metal surface to create a design in relief in the metal. While aquatint is a form of etching that is used to produce tonal effects, rather than lines. 2. \\"Original\\" remains \\"original\\" in English. It's to assure the authenticity of the artwork and affirms it isn't a reproduction or copy. 3. \\"Firmada\\" translates to \\"signed\\". The artist themselves has authenticated it by putting their signature on it. In art, the signature of the artist is an important aspect as it confirms the authenticity of the work. 4. \\"Numerada 184/220\\" translates to \\"numbered 184/220\\". It typically indicates that the work is an element of a limited series. In this case, it's the 184th piece out of a possible 220. The lower the last number is, the more valuable and desirable the work tends to be since there are fewer of them. So, \\"Grabado al Aguafuerte y acuatinta original firmada y numerada 184/220\\" refers to an original print (either etching or aquatint) verified by the artist's signature and serialized as 184 out of a limited 220 pieces."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

While it does provide an approximate timeline for when the World Trade Center Montevideo was constructed, it could be better tailored to specifically answer the question. A more detailed and long answer to the question could be: The World Trade Center Montevideo, located in Montevideo, Uruguay, was constructed in 1998 as part of the city's rapid economic development and modernization efforts during the 1990s. This massive building complex, consisting of four towers, has since become one of Uruguay's most important hubs of business and commerce, offering various services and hosting numerous local and international companies. In addition to the World Trade Center Montevideo, several other significant infrastructural projects were undertaken during this period, notably the Telecommunications Tower, completed in 2000. This 157-meter tall tower serves as the headquarters for ANTEL, the government-owned telecommunications company in Uruguay, and plays a significant role in strengthening Montevideo's position within the global marketplace. The construction of the World Trade Center Montevideo, as well as the Telecommunications Tower, reflects the city's commitment to economic growth, innovation, and global integration. Since their completion in the late 1990s and early 2000s, these landmark buildings have attracted businesses and investors worldwide and have contributed to Uruguay's status as an emerging economy with the potential for continued growth and development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I heard that Austin's home was destroyed in a freak storm so when friends and neighbours called to offer help Austin accepted every offer. And I was wondering How would you describe Austin? Choose your answer from: 1). a popular person. 2). like he lost everything. 3). an unpopular person. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, I would describe Austin as a popular person. This is because in the wake of the destruction of his home, the numerous offers of help from friends and neighbors indicate that he is well-liked and respected within his community. It is important to note that his willingness to accept help during this time of crisis also demonstrates his humility and openness to relying on the support of his community. The relationships he has nurtured with those around him have resulted in a strong network of people who care about his well-being and are willing to go the extra mile to help him in his time of need. Moreover, a person's popularity can often be determined by the extent to which others are willing to provide assistance when they face difficulties. It's evident that Austin has polished positive connections with people around him, allowing them to feel comfortable reaching out to offer help when they hear about the disaster that befell him. The empathy and compassion shown towards Austin by his friends and neighbors signal a strong connection he shares with them, which is a testament to his sociable nature. The fact that Austin lost everything in the storm is a separate aspect of his situation that doesn't necessarily impact his popularity. The outpouring of support he has received in response to this tragedy is an indicator of how he is perceived by the people around him. The devastation he experienced can engender incredible sympathy, but the willingness of others to step up and offer their help speaks to their regard for Austin as a person. The label of \\"unpopular\\" would not apply in this context, given the overall support Austin has been able to garner from his community. In conclusion, it's clear that Austin has cultivated a strong network of supportive friends and neighbors, who are eager to be there for him in his time of need. Therefore, describing Austin as a popular person would be the most accurate assessment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I don't often give one star reviews, but the computer won't let me do negative numbers. The opening titles tell us we're in deep water already. Although this is a low budget exploitation film, there are 17 producers credited. No. No. At the beginning of the story abusive husband Kenneth comes home to his family in an upscale gated community. The house is a pigsty. His wife, Della (Kim Basinger) has let the children run amok all day. OK. We're already in deep water. Ms. Basinger was 55 years old when the film came out. Uh, are these her children or grandchildren? It's Christmas Eve. Della drives to the mall, a lengthy scene that could have been cut. To bludgeon home the idea of eeeeeeevil male aggression rampant in the universe she drives past football players in full uniform playing in pouring rain on Christmas Eve. Sure. For a bonus she sees a vehicle with a slaughtered deer tied to it. We get some actual suspense in the driving scenes, though. It's raining and traffic is bad. First we see Della try to drive and smoke at the same time. Then later Della tries to drive and talk on her cell phone at the same time, at one point turning completely around to check the cluttered back seat for the charger for the phone. She wanders the mall, sees an old friend from college, tries to buy stuff but her credit card is declined- gosh, maybe her husband is grumpy because he's going broke, but that's too complicated for the script to follow. In the parking lot she runs afoul of the most ludicrous gang in the history of films. One White boy (Lukas Hass watching his career go down the toilet), one Black, one Asian, and one Hispanic. Imagine a company of Up with People gone to the bad and you'll have the idea. Although they have a gun she gives them attitude. A mall cop comes to investigate the ruckus and they shoot him in the head, firing more than once. The parking lot is crowded as can be, people everywhere, and nobody notices. Della escapes in her car and rather than choosing a police station or well lighted safe area, she drives to a construction site, where she kills all four bad boys one at a time with simply the tools (literally) at hand. MAJOR spoiler ahead. She drives back home. The car poops out so she walks through the pouring rain. Checks on the children, goes downstairs, and when her husband petulantly asks what she got him at the mall shows him the gun and shoots him at point blank range. The experience with the four punks was supposed to result in personal empowerment for Della. Instead we know that her children will probably spend Christmas in foster care or a group home, because the State will collect them while she answers to murder one charges. The four punks can be classified as justifiable homicide in self defense. The husband, different story. I'm so glad I saw this on cable. If I'd seen it in a theater (did it get any release?) I'd have been furious. As is, I'm just sad seeing talents like Ms. Basinger and Mr. Haas waste themselves on garbage like this. One very good thing, though.

Please answer the following question: Question: How is constitutionalism used in the American Government today? I found the following answer on Google: Constitutionalism, in its most general meaning, is \\"a complex of ideas, attitudes, and patterns of behavior elaborating the principle that the authority of government derives from and is limited by a body of fundamental law\\". Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the definition you found on Google about constitutionalism is correct. In the context of the American government today, constitutionalism is the idea that the government's authority and power are established, derived from, and limited by the U.S. Constitution. The Constitution outlines the structure and functions of the federal government, the rights that citizens possess, and the principles guiding the government. Constitutionalism in the American government today can be observed in several ways, including: 1. Separation of powers: The U.S. Constitution divides the powers of the federal government among three distinct but interrelated branches: the Legislative (Congress), the Executive (the President), and the Judicial (the Supreme Court and federal courts). This separation of powers prevents any single branch from becoming too powerful and encourages checks and balances to maintain a fair and functioning government. 2. Federalism: The U.S. Constitution establishes a system of federalism, in which power is divided between the federal government and state governments. This balance allows for the sharing of responsibilities and ensures that the federal government does not become too centralized and oppressive. 3. Bill of Rights: The first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, known as the Bill of Rights, protect individual liberties and rights. The existence of these rights reflects the principle that the government should be limited in its powers over citizens. 4. Judicial review: The U.S. Supreme Court, authorized by the Constitution, has the power to review whether the laws and actions of the government are constitutional. This process helps to ensure that the government abides by the Constitution and respects the limits placed on its powers. 5. Democratic elections and representation: The U.S. Constitution establishes a democratic system of government, with regular elections and representation in Congress. This allows for the people to have a voice in the government and helps ensure that the government remains accountable to its citizens. In summary, constitutionalism is an essential aspect of the American government today, as the Constitution serves as the foundation for the nation's entire political and legal system. The Constitution not only outlines the structure and functions of the government but also enshrines the principles of limited government, separation of powers, and respect for individual rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mikaela hurriedly combed her hair at a kitchen table as she made the Skype connection while Eileen rushed to wash dishes in the sink so the background would not look messy. Mikaela, who graduated from high school a month earlier, was thoughtful and forthcoming with the reporters, but as soon as she finished and the laptop was shut, mother and daughter burst out laughing. “Because she skis so efficiently, everyone perceives Mikaela as this perfectly prepped, organized little machine,” Eileen said. “And here I am running around in the background as the world watches me clean my countertop and stove.

We have no plan.” Nevertheless, Shiffrin, who is often called the next Lindsey Vonn, will be a featured personality at the Sochi Games, especially on American television now that the injured Vonn has withdrawn. With a gleaming smile, long blond hair and no pretension, Shiffrin is a star in waiting. The only hard part may be waiting until the last few days of the Games for her events, giant slalom and slalom. But one of the final, lasting Alpine images of Sochi may be Shiffrin’s Olympic debut. She could become the face of a new generation of ski racing champions, a gold medalist raised in Colorado and New Hampshire who is already known throughout Europe by one name: Mikaela. As Roland Pfeifer, her Austrian-born coach, said: “Mikaela is a once-in-a-lifetime talent. One day, she could beat everyone at everything.” Shiffrin has already done a good job beating everyone in slalom, her best event. Racing in Europe since she was 15, she not only won last year’s world slalom championship before 30,000 screaming Austrian fans — most of whom were rooting for the second-place Austrian finisher — but also awed the ski community with her dominance in the World Cup slalom standings. In the last year, she has won six World Cup slalom races and finished second or third in two other races. In the last three months, she has stunned the World Cup circuit anew in giant slalom. With a second-place and a third-place finish in World Cup races, and two other top-10 finishes, she has demonstrated that she will also be a contender for Olympic gold in giant slalom. But the Shiffrin phenomenon is about more than winning races. It is about her rapid improvement. Although some of her competitors have 300 more World Cup starts, Shiffrin began winning by implausibly large margins last season. To put her accomplishments in perspective, consider that Shiffrin was a world champion at 17; Vonn was 24 when she won her first world championship gold medal. In a sport defined by the speed one can go downhill, Shiffrin’s ascent in women’s skiing has almost defied gravity. A wunderkind since she was 11, she is neither physically imposing (5 feet 7 inches, 145 pounds) nor especially aggressive nor intimidating (an aw-shucks smile seems to be her natural expression). On skis, she does not appear to be going that fast. Her upper body is virtually motionless, her eyes are quiet and she does not create particularly dynamic angles on the snow with her skis. The only thing that truly stands out about a Shiffrin race is her finish time. “It’s about the purity and serenity of her form,” said her teammate Ted Ligety, a four-time world champion. “At top speed on an icy, steep racecourse, the hardest thing in the world is making it look effortless. Mikaela does that.” That is why they call her the Mozart of ski racing. But that only adds to the mystery. Because how does one nurture a prodigy? “The question everyone asks me is: How did she get so good so soon?” Eileen said as Mikaela made scrambled eggs after the Skype interview. “There is no exact answer. People tell me I should write a book. I laugh, because you know what I would put in the book? How Mikaela got good because she had to shovel cow manure for weeks with me when we were replacing our lawn one summer. “It was 90 degrees and she was 10 years old and she worked so hard without complaining. So she’s a good ski racer because she did all kinds of different developmental things — like learning a good work ethic — but none of them were part of a plan to make a world champion.” To the Shiffrins — including her father, Jeff, and her older brother, Taylor, a college ski racer — Mikaela’s journey to the top of the mountain is what they call a succession of not mere coincidences. The family moved regularly for Jeff’s job as an anesthesiologist, shuttling between Vail Valley in Colorado and northern New England more than once. The relocations were fitful and sometimes distressing, with the children occasionally begging to leave one place or the other. But looking back, the Shiffrins insist that every step was essential to Mikaela’s development, even when mother and daughter helped to rebuild the lawn in front of their house in New Hampshire. “I really developed some shoulder definition from that,” Mikaela said with a laugh. Not surprisingly, any predetermined strategy was remarkably elemental and always focused on process, not results. Jeff and Eileen, former college-level racers, believed in basic tenets, like keeping a light race schedule for their children as they loaded up on practice days filled with deliberate, skills-based drills and exercises. And, they said, it was imperative to keep family close by. Yet, these were controversial theories in the ski racing community — both when Mikaela was starting out and when she advanced to the World Cup. Youth coaches were livid when Mikaela, faster than skiers several years older, chose to stay close to home to practice with her family instead of chasing the prestige of distant championships. Several years later, Eileen said, the United States ski team was adamantly against her accompaniment of Mikaela on the World Cup circuit in Europe. Eileen went anyway, and the Shiffrins paid for it for three years. “Our plan produced the first 17-year-old World Cup champion the U.S. has ever had,” Eileen said. “They should thank us for our 500,000 donation to the U.S. ski team.” The message, the Shiffrins insist, is that their approach, which stressed skill development and shunned goal setting, and always involved the family, has been the secret. If there was a secret. “If you look at it, what we always sought was normalcy,” Eileen said. Jeff recalled: “These top-level coaches would tell me that Mikaela was just ripping up a racecourse. And I would say: ‘Yeah, I agree, but she’s just 9 years old.’ And they’d say, ‘What are your plans for her?’ And I’d answer: ‘Plans? Well, tomorrow she’s trying out for a part as the angel in the Christmas play.’ “We didn’t have plans. A million things could have happened.” A million things did happen. They just seem to have produced the best 18-year-old skier, male or female, in United States history. To hear the Shiffrins speak of the many twists and turns in Mikaela’s path, it began when they left the ski mecca of Vail, Colo., and moved to a New Hampshire town they had virtually never seen and a remote new house that Eileen and Mikaela had trouble finding after a cross-country drive. “I hated it in the East at the start,” Mikaela said, sitting in a gym outside Vail after a workout in September. “My parents said the East and the West were totally different, so they wanted us to know both so we understood the diversity of places. But the differences were tough to adjust to. It rained a lot in New Hampshire, and when I skied the snow was icy and hard, and the mountains were small. The people, the schools, the clothes — everything was different.” Jeff Shiffrin took a job at the medical center in central New Hampshire operated by Dartmouth College, his alma mater. Eileen, a former intensive care unit nurse, turned her focus to raising Mikaela and Taylor. She said: “We had moved from a nice house in a Colorado resort town to a tiny house in the country, and while we had a lot of land, which was great, the New Hampshire house was in terrible shape. So we started working 14-hour days repainting the entire inside and outside of the house and fixing everything up.” From unicycles to inline skates, Mikaela Shiffrin spent plenty of time off skis, as when she played in the garage with her brother at age 6. Then grubs destroyed their lawn. “So we rebuilt the lawn, too,” Eileen said. Mikaela said: “The whole experience turned out to be really educational. We were on our own, and we found out there’s a way to fix everything — usually through hard work.” When Taylor did not make a travel soccer team with all his new friends, the reaction of the Shiffrins was emblematic of their approach to almost everything. “My mom went on Amazon and bought about 10 different World Cup soccer DVDs,” Mikaela said. “And she bought 12-foot-high rebound nets and bungee cords and all these contraptions so we could set up our own soccer complex in the backyard. Every day that summer, we had our own soccer camp for six or eight hours.” Mikaela recalled that they bought a unicycle because Eileen had read that it was good for balance, which she considered a pivotal athletic skill. The Shiffrin children also learned to juggle to improve their coordination. “We then started going around our block, which was two miles long, riding the unicycle and juggling at the same time,” Mikaela said. “And if I was doing that, then Taylor would be behind me dribbling a soccer ball as he ran around the block.” Eileen was confident it would pay off, even as she worried what people were saying about her children. “You would see the neighbors coming out to watch the Shiffrins going around the block juggling on a unicycle,” Eileen said. “I’m sure they thought we were completely nuts.” But the next summer, Taylor and Mikaela made their travel soccer teams. As Eileen recalled: “The coach said to me: ‘What did you do? They’re great now.’ And I said, ‘You don’t really want to know.’ ” Jeff said: “Some people might call our approach intense. But it’s not, because the motivation is not to be better than other people at something. The motivation comes from a belief that almost anything can be mastered if you’re willing to put in the hours to master it. If you’re going to do something, do it as best as you can.” “She was a happy little kid,” Rika Moore, a youth coach at Vail, said of Shiffrin, “but she was unbelievably focused on making perfect turns, one after another.” Mikaela and Taylor, who races for the University of Denver, insist they were never pushed in athletics. “I’d say it was the opposite,” Mikaela said. “I remember as a little girl in Vail, it would be a powder day and my parents would say, ‘Let’s go free ski in the back bowls.’ And I’d say: ‘No, I want to stay on the racecourse and train. I’m working on my pole plants.’ I wanted to get better at something every day.” Rika Moore, a longtime youth ski racing coach in Vail, recalled that Eileen coached on the race training hill when she was pregnant with Mikaela. “They’re all good athletes in that family, and they all love ski racing,” Moore said. “But from the time she was 7 years old, Mikaela was very determined to ski clean arcs in the snow. A lot of kids are in the race program to be with their friends or because their parents want them to do it. Not Mikaela. She was a happy little kid, but she was unbelievably focused on making perfect turns, one after another.” But when the Shiffrins moved east in 2003, they traded safe, dependable packed powder for what racers call boilerplate blue ice. It can be perilous; Mikaela eventually saw it as an advantage. “If you don’t have excellent technique, you won’t be upright on that hard ice for long,” she said. “Those East Coast racecourses prepared me for the World Cup circuit because the snow in Europe and the racecourses there are very much like the snow and the racecourses in the East. “If I hadn’t come east as a kid, I might still be a World Cup racer today, but I wouldn’t be the same World Cup racer. And there were cultural or geographic conditions in the East that helped me, too.” Mikaela had learned to be an all-around skier in Vail because of the vastness of its big-mountain experience. When she got to New Hampshire, she ended up at tiny Storrs Hill Ski Area. The vertical drop at Vail is about 3,500 feet. At Storrs Hill, it is 300 feet. But a long line of American champion ski racers cut their teeth at small mountains. One of them was Vonn, who learned to ski on a bump of a hill next to a Minnesota interstate. Jeff and Eileen Shiffrin were volunteer coaches at Storrs Hill along with Rick Colt, the Alpine director, and they sculptured Mikaela five days a week, including three weeknights. “We’d get out of school, do our homework on the 45-minute drive to Storrs Hill, then train on into the night,” Mikaela said. “When it’s a small place, you get up and down quickly. We’d get 25 runs through a course. You can’t get that many on a big mountain. I learned to love it in the East.” Mikaela continued to keep a light race schedule, but when she did get in the start house she usually won. Sometimes by a lot. In racing circles, news of her prowess spread. Youth coaches saw an evolving star in Mikaela, but the Shiffrins still strived for normalcy. She laughed off the renown, although when the local newspaper asked what she did to relax, Mikaela said she watched videos of World Cup championship skiers. In the summer, Mikaela and Taylor used in-line skates to simulate skis. Eileen turned broomsticks into slalom gates and taught her children the intricate rhythm and tempo of hand movements needed to block and push them away. Eventually, Mikaela and Taylor caught the eye of the best Eastern coaches. When Taylor enrolled at Burke Mountain Academy, a boarding school in northern Vermont for ski racers, Mikaela, then 11, went, too. Kirk Dwyer, the Burke headmaster and coach, saw in Mikaela a perfectly balanced and confident skier — riding the unicycle had benefits — with a rare outlook on competition. “She truly believed that the focus should be on the process of getting better and not race results,” Dwyer said. “She does that to this day. Everyone on the World Cup says they want to race like they practice, but how many actually do it? Mikaela can because she’s not thinking about trying to win. She’s thinking about getting better.” When Mikaela was 13, her father got a job in Denver and the family returned to Vail. “I love Vail, but at the same time I was depressed,” she said. “I missed my friends and I missed my coach at Burke.” So Mikaela went back east, as did Eileen, who rented a condominium near Burke, about 25 miles from the Canadian border. It was the first of several winters that Jeff and Eileen lived apart. “If I have to get on a plane to visit my family for the weekend, so be it,” Jeff said. “It was not a sacrifice because it was the right move for the kids.” But it was a costly decision, especially when Mikaela started leaving Burke to ski in Europe, with Eileen in tow. The Shiffrins’ house here is comfortable and homey, albeit nine miles from the pizazz of the Vail resort village. “Do I sometimes wish we had a bigger house and fancier cars?” Jeff said. “Yes, and sometimes there has been some material envy. But we’ve been willing to delay gratification knowing the return in the long run will be worth it.” Acclimating to World Cup life was not easy. The language and food were different, Eileen had to drive everywhere in Europe, and Mikaela was left out of the social scene. “She was 15 or 16, she wasn’t going to bars with the 28-year-olds,” Eileen said. Mother and daughter passed evenings watching romantic comedies on DVD, along with episodes of “Friends” and “Glee.” Many an afternoon was devoted to home schooling Mikaela, with Eileen as tutor and study partner. “But you know, it was all part of the growth experience,” Mikaela said. “It’s like getting down a tough racecourse. Things you don’t expect come up and you have to adapt. You can’t let it throw you off. You have to cope. Those are all really valuable skills, in life and racing.” Last year, Mikaela graduated from high school and brought a World Cup globe and world championship gold medal back to the United States. Others, especially Europeans, are astonished at what she has achieved in such a short time, but Mikaela appears unaffected by her success. “I believe there is always a faster way to do things,” she said in September after playing tennis with her mother. “Whether it’s learning to hit a backhand in tennis, learning high school chemistry or getting better at ski racing, I really believe with hard work and analytic preparation, you can skip a few steps and find the faster way.” It is something of a family motto: Be faster. Up next are the pressure and expectations of the Olympics, where she will be the odds-on favorite to win the slalom. Mikaela is not running from the attention. “I know that in the United States, the Olympics are the only time millions and millions of people watch ski racing, so it means a lot to the sport and the country,” she said. “So I understand the significance, but at the same time, it’s not the end of the world. “I will want to win. But the result of the race will not motivate me. I can honestly say that I am motivated by improvement, not results. That’s a core principle.” Mikaela exchanges Twitter messages with Missy Franklin, the Colorado swimmer who won four gold medals at the 2012 London Olympics as a 17-year-old. “I just think it’s cool that Missy even knows who I am,” Mikaela said, giggling. “But it is comforting knowing that someone has done it at 17 or 18. It makes me think that if she can do it, why can’t I? It proves that I don’t have to wait. Let’s get this show on the road right now.” Skiing’s Mozart is ready for the big stage. “I always roll my eyes at that Mozart stuff,” Eileen said at the end of a typically long day in her energetic household. (On what Mikaela called an off day, she still lifted weights at the gym for more than an hour and played nearly two hours of tennis.) “Did Mozart plan his achievements?” Eileen said. “Or did he maximize the opportunities in his life by working really hard? Did he just enjoy it? I feel like we’ve just stumbled upon some things and been in the right place at the right time with the right people helping us. But then we always made the most of those situations as they happened.” For someone so young, Mikaela takes the longer view. “I’m no superhero, and how I got here is a crazy path that probably could not be replicated,” she said. “But it doesn’t have to be replicated. I may have become a world champion quicker than most, but people should look at me and realize there are all kinds of ways to get where you want to go. “Because we didn’t plan it.

Summarize this article: His plane touched down in Panama City on Sunday evening after flying from Paris via Madrid. He was convicted in absentia of crimes committed during his time in power in the 1980s. The 77-year-old has already spent more than 20 years in prisons in France and the United States. Last month, a French court approved a request from Panama to send him back home to be jailed over his convictions for murder, corruption and embezzlement. He had the right to appeal, but his lawyers said he wanted to return to Panama. Foreign Minister Roberto Henriquez has said the government's priority is to guarantee Noriega's safety. Noriega travelled with a team of Panamanian officials, including the country's attorney-general and a doctor. After his arrival, he was escorted to El Renacer jail, south east of Panama City. Although he was never president, General Manuel Noriega served as Panama's de facto leader between 1983 to 1989. Once a US ally, he was arrested by invading American troops in January 1990, amid allegations he had turned the Central American nation into a drug-trafficking hub. He spent 20 years in prison in the US after being convicted there of the charges. In 2010, he was extradited from the US to France, where he had been convicted in absentia of laundering money from Colombian drug gangs through a French bank to buy property in Paris. He received a seven-year jail sentence from the French court. In Panama itself, he faces three 20-year jail terms for crimes committed during his rule, including the murders of political opponents. However, it remains unclear whether he will remain in prison, as Panama allows people aged 70 years and above to serve their sentences at home.","completion":"General Manuel Noriega, who was a de facto leader of Panama during the 1980s, has been returned to his home country from France, following approval by a French court in response to a request from Panama.

B. was the boy to make his acquaintance. Miss Tox, however, maintaining her reserved behaviour, and frigidly declining to understand the Major whenever he called (which he often did) on any little fishing excursion connected with this project, the Major, in spite of his constitutional toughness and slyness, was fain to leave the accomplishment of his desire in some measure to chance, 'which,' as he was used to observe with chuckles at his club, 'has been fifty to one in favour of Joey B., Sir, ever since his elder brother died of Yellow Jack in the West Indies.' It was some time coming to his aid in the present instance, but it befriended him at last. When the dark servant, with full particulars, reported Miss Tox absent on Brighton service, the Major was suddenly touched with affectionate reminiscences of his friend Bill Bitherstone of Bengal, who had written to ask him, if he ever went that way, to bestow a call upon his only son. But when the same dark servant reported Paul at Mrs Pipchin's, and the Major, referring to the letter favoured by Master Bitherstone on his arrival in England--to which he had never had the least idea of paying any attention--saw the opening that presented itself, he was made so rabid by the gout, with which he happened to be then laid up, that he threw a footstool at the dark servant in return for his intelligence, and swore he would be the death of the rascal before he had done with him: which the dark servant was more than half disposed to believe. 1.

Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Olympic Genome Project Shows What You Share With Medal Hopefuls What do you have in common with Olympic athletes? Maybe you and a future star went to the same college, or maybe a world-class competitor in a little-known sport hails from your hometown. Exposing the connections between everyday fans and Olympians or Olympic hopefuls is the idea behind a Facebook app called the U.S. Olympic Genome Project from summer games sponsor Samsung. If you hit “like” on the app’s landing page, it uses information from your Facebook profile to cross reference facts about you against a database of some 3,000 athletes. Then it shows you who you share the most in common with and why. Ralph Santana, Samsung‘s chief marketing officer in North America, tells Mashable the idea behind the app is to in part bring more attention to athletes who often get overshadowed by media hype. “People don’t necessarily know how they’re connected to Olympic athletes, unlike other sports where people know more about how they’re connected to teams and players by hometown or area,” Santana says. “You lose a little bit of that in the Olympics, when you only hear about the real high-profile athletes being discussed while NBC is kind of curating the event.” The U.S. Olympic Genome Project also comes with a gamification layer to foster extended engagement. After seeing what they have in common with athletes, users can take trivia quizzes and answer questions about themselves to compete in rankings with their Facebook friends and earn tokens that can then be applied toward real-life rewards including discounted Samsung products. So what’s in it for Samsung? Santana says little more than good will, but hopefully some sales driving as well. “It backs into our overarching strategy, which is how do we tap into the cultural face of sports and make Samsung a culturally relevant brand,” he says. Do you think this is a cool idea by Samsung or not? Let us know in the comments.","completion":"The U.S. Olympic Genome Project is a Facebook app made by Samsung.

Act 1: The film opens with a brief introduction of the Men in Black organization, which is responsible for working in the shadows to protect Earth from alien threats and maintain a facade of normal life for humans. The story begins with Agent J and Agent K working on a seemingly routine mission, hunting down a dangerous shape-shifting alien known as \\"The Imitator.\\" In the process, they stumble upon cryptic clues leading them to question the true identity of their newly appointed Chief, Zed. Act 2: With growing suspicion, Agent J and Agent K begin a covert investigation into Zed's past. Simultaneously, they must work together to stop an imminent and catastrophic intergalactic war that threatens Earth's existence. As they cultivate trust with one another, they uncover hidden clues that point toward Zed's potential secret - that he is not who he appears to be, and that his intentions may be more ominous than they had anticipated. During their investigation, they also become acquainted with double agents within the MIB organization and a human-alien hybrid who provides them with critical intel about a powerful artifact known as \\"The Omnistone.\\" The Omnistone has the ability to manipulate reality, and the story's antagonist is hell-bent on harnessing its power for their own sinister purposes.

Along the way, they must also confront Zed and expose him for who he truly is - the mastermind behind the shadowy organization that has infiltrated MIB at its highest levels.

Do not pull the kitten out of the cat carrier right away; leave it in there with the door open and allow it to exit the carrier at its own pace. Make sure it sees its food and water bowl. This may motivate the kitten to leave its carrier and explore. When the kitten does come out, gently pick it up and place it in the litter box to give it an opportunity to go to the bathroom. If the kitten doesn’t go, at least it will know there is a litter box for it use. If you have other pets in the house, keep the kitten in its own room (along with litter box, bed, food and water) for a week before introducing him to the other pets. If you have small children, instruct them to be very gentle when they pick up, hold, or play with the kitten to avoid injury to either the kitten or kid. Just let it take its time and it will get used to you and the house soon. Keep the kitten in one room (unless you are there to watch carefully) and other pets away from the kitten for a week before introducing the cat to the other pets.

The hearing was the first for Matthew and Grace Huang since they were released from custody last month on bail. They have been ordered to remain in Doha. The couple deny charges of murdering Gloria, one of three children they adopted from Africa. She died in January. Both the defense and the prosecution presented written and oral arguments to the court Tuesday. In his statement, the prosecutor painted a picture of Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane people who had been \\"cheaply sold\\" their adopted child. He called for both to be given the death penalty for the girl's death and, in colorful language, suggested that he could visualize her rushing up to the judges' bench, begging for justice. He said the Huangs kept Gloria locked in her room, deprived of food and water, and that a key was found on the outside of the door. The prosecutor argued that both the hospital and forensics reports on her death indicated that she died of starvation and that any witness statements should be discounted by the court. He also cited testimony from one of the girl's brothers, saying the child told prosecutors that their parents used to punish Gloria for stealing food by locking her into her room. Medical records. Defense lawyer Sami Abu Sheikha argued that there is no evidence to indicate the couple had wanted to kill their daughter. Witnesses had seen Gloria eating on the Friday and the Monday before her death in the early hours of Tuesday, January 15, the lawyer said, adding that two days without food would not have been enough for her to starve to death. He also pointed to hospital and forensic reports that showed she died of dehydration and cachexia, a wasting condition. This can result from causes other than starvation, Abu Sheikha said. The reports showed that her pancreas was inflamed, which could mean it wasn't working properly, and there was inflammation of the lungs, he said. The reports also showed that Gloria had ingested food and liquid that was still in her intestines and bladder, he said. The defense lawyer also cited Gloria's siblings as telling the prosecutor she had been playing with them outside her room before she died. Other witnesses had also seen her the day before her death, he said. Abu Sheikha added that photographs showed bottles of water beside the child's bed and that, in any case, her room had a bathroom where she could have drunk the water from the taps if she needed to. He said her medical records showed that she had a history of eating disorders. Defense effort. The judge ordered that the defense be given another chance to rebut the prosecution's arguments in a hearing February 5. The two defendants appeared more relaxed and better rested than in their previous court appearance, when they were still in detention. Grace, who had previously appeared in court with her head covered, was this time dressed in slacks and a blouse with her hair uncovered. No relatives of the Huangs' were in court Tuesday, but a handful of staff members from the U.S. Embassy in Doha were present. The David House Agency, an advocacy group for Americans overseas, has been coordinating the Huangs' defense effort. In August, the agency set up a website that describes the circumstances of their detention. Matthew and Grace Huang moved to Qatar in 2012 with their three adopted children. Matthew, a Stanford-educated engineer, was working on infrastructure projects related to the 2022 World Cup. But everything changed January 15, when he found his daughter dead. The parents were arrested, charged with murder and accused of starving their daughter to death. The David House Agency says Gloria's eating disorder involved starving herself and then bingeing on food. It says this disorder arose from her childhood in Ghana before she was adopted.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Merleau-Ponty distinguishes between primary and secondary modes of expression. This distinction appears in Phenomenology of Perception (p. 207, 2nd note [Fr. ed.]) and is sometimes repeated in terms of spoken and speaking language (le langage parle et le langage parlant) (The Prose of the World, p. 10). Spoken language (le langage parle), or secondary expression, returns to our linguistic baggage, to the cultural heritage that we have acquired, as well as the brute mass of relationships between signs and significations. Speaking language (le langage parlant), or primary expression, such as it is, is language in the production of a sense, language at the advent of a thought, at the moment where it makes itself an advent of sense. It is speaking language, that is to say, primary expression, that interests Merleau-Ponty and which keeps his attention through his treatment of the nature of production and the reception of expressions, a subject which also overlaps with an analysis of action, of intentionality, of perception, as well as the links between freedom and external conditions. The notion of style occupies an important place in \\"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence\\". In spite of certain similarities with Andre Malraux, Merleau-Ponty distinguishes himself from Malraux in respect to three conceptions of style, the last of which is employed in Malraux's The Voices of Silence. Merleau-Ponty remarks that in this work \\"style\\" is sometimes used by Malraux in a highly subjective sense, understood as a projection of the artist's individuality. Sometimes it is used, on the contrary, in a very metaphysical sense (in Merleau-Ponty's opinion, a mystical sense), in which style is connected with a conception of an \\"uber-artist\\" expressing \\"the Spirit of Painting\\". Finally, it sometimes is reduced to simply designating a categorization of an artistic school or movement. (However, this account of Malraux's notion of style--a key element in his thinking--is open to serious question.) For Merleau-Ponty, it is these uses of the notion of style that lead Malraux to postulate a cleavage between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of painting in his own time, a conclusion that Merleau-Ponty disputes. According to Merleau-Ponty, it is important to consider the heart of this problematic, by recognizing that style is first of all a demand owed to the primacy of perception, which also implies taking into consideration the dimensions of historicity and intersubjectivity. (However, Merleau-Ponty's reading of Malraux has been questioned in a recent major study of Malraux's theory of art which argues that Merleau-Ponty seriously misunderstood Malraux.) For Merleau-Ponty, style is born of the interaction between two or more fields of being. Rather than being exclusive to individual human consciousness, consciousness is born of the pre-conscious style of the world, of Nature. Answer this question \\"Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in the article, including: 1. The distinction between primary and secondary modes of expression, which are referred to as spoken and speaking language, is a key concept explored by Merleau-Ponty in his works. Primary expression, or speaking language, is particularly significant as it involves language in the production of a sense and the advent of thought. 2. Merleau-Ponty's analysis of expression also covers various interconnected subjects like action, intentionality, perception, and the relationship between freedom and external conditions. 3. The notion of style, as discussed in \\"Indirect Language and the Voices of Silence,\\" is another intriguing aspect. Merleau-Ponty differentiates his approach from André Malraux's conception of style, which can be seen in three ways: as a projection of the artist's individuality, as part of a metaphysical (or mystical) conception of an \\"über-artist,\\" or as a simple categorization of an artistic movement or school. 4. Merleau-Ponty challenges Malraux's idea of a split between the objectivity of Italian Renaissance painting and the subjectivity of modern painting by emphasizing the importance of considering perception, historicity, and intersubjectivity when analyzing style. 5. Finally, Merleau-Ponty's understanding of style revolves around the interaction between two or more fields of being. He proposes that consciousness arises not only from individual human experiences but also from the pre-conscious style of the world and nature. This perspective has led to some debate as it contrasts with Malraux's views, and some argue that Merleau-Ponty may have misunderstood Malraux's theory of art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is confirmed by the context's exact words, which describe him as an 'American singer-songwriter.' The context also offers more information about this individual beyond your hypothesis, providing a range of additional details that confirm other aspects of Brandon Flowers' music career. Firstly, the context points out that he is the lead singer of a band named 'The Killers'. The Killers is a well-known American rock band that has gained significant international popularity.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. Question: \\"Who outraged Libyans of al Qaeda?\\" Response: \\"Bin Laden cutting his support\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question. The outraged Libyans of al Qaeda were upset because Bin Laden had to inform them that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave Sudan due to the Sudanese government yielding to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their road win over the Bengals, the Titans went home for a Week 3 duel with the Houston Texans. In the first quarter, Tennessee trailed early as Houston Texans kicker Kris Brown got a 44-yard field goal. The Titans responded with RB LenDale White getting a 2-yard TD run. Houston drew close as Brown kicked a 24-yard field goal, yet Tennessee answered with QB Kerry Collins completing a 9-yard TD pass to TE Bo Scaife.

In the third quarter, Tennessee increased its lead with kicker Rob Bironas nailing a 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Titans closed out the game with CB Cortland Finnegan returning an interception 99 yards for a touchdown. With the win, Tennessee acquired its first 3-0 start since their Super Bowl run of 1999. How many yards longer was Cortland Finnegan's touchdown compared to all the other touchdowns in the game combined?","completion":"To figure out the total yards of all the other touchdowns, I will add up the yards mentioned in the description of each touchdown. Starting with LenDale White's touchdowns: He had a 2-yard TD run and a 1-yard TD run, contributing a total of 2+1=3 yards. Next is the touchdown by QB Kerry Collins and TE Bo Scaife, which was a 9-yard TD pass. So that contributes 9 yards. Finally, Steve Slaton's touchdown was a 6-yard TD run, so that's an additional 6 yards. When we add all these together, we get a total of 3+9+6=18 yards. Cortland Finnegan's touchdown was a 99-yard interception return. To find out how much longer this was compared to all other touchdowns combined, we subtract the total yards of the other touchdowns from Finnegan's touchdown. This calculation is: 99-18=81 yards.

Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the cab driver did not speak English very well, indicating communication difficulties. This may lead the reviewer to feel frustrated and uncomfortable during their cab ride, making their overall experience less enjoyable. Secondly, the reviewer notes that the cab driver attempted to take them on the freeway, which they believed was a longer and more expensive route. They express their disapproval and disagreement with the driver's suggestion, which shows dissatisfaction with the service provided. Finally, the reviewer praises Discount Cab for \\"saving the day,\\" suggesting that their previous experience with the initial cab company was not positive.

In his first address since returning to Pakistan from self-exile, former President Pervez Musharraf declared his intention to run for office, saying he defied risks to \\"save\\" the country. Musharraf landed in Karachi on Sunday after more than four years in exile. He faces criminal charges, and the Taliban have vowed to unleash a \\"death squad\\" to assassinate him. However, he said, he does not plan to flee again. \\"I have put my life in danger and have come to Pakistan -- to you to be the savior of this country,\\" he said at the airport. \\"I have come to save Pakistan.\\" He chided people who had doubted that he would return. \\"There were rumors that I would not come -- where are those people now?\\" he asked. \\"I am here. I have returned.\\" At the airport, crowds danced, waved the nation's green flag and chanted Musharraf's name. Some people carried giant posters, plastered with his face. \\"Inshallah (God willing) we will be successful if I have your support,\\" he said. After his statement, he was whisked away to an undisclosed location for safety reasons. Police hovered nearby, guns slung from their shoulders. Complicated return. Musharraf resigned as president of the south Asian nation five years ago and went into exile in London and Dubai. He hopes to reassert his influence and lead his party in May elections. His return comes with complications. Government officials have said he would be arrested as soon as he sets foot in the nation while the Pakistani Taliban have vowed to assassinate him. However, his party says it has taken pre-emptive measures to ward off a potential arrest. \\"Musharraf has been granted bail in advance of his arrival to Pakistan. We have made sure that he is not arrested and his return home will be smooth,\\" said Jawed Siddiqui, a member of the former president's party, All Pakistan Muslim League. His lawyers paid an unknown amount of bail, which means Musharraf will not be arrested for at least 15 days, but must appear in court. Fear of the unknown. Musharraf's return home comes with a lot of uncertainties. As he boarded a flight from Dubai International Airport, Musharraf said he was not nervous, but was concerned about the unknown. His wife, Sehba, had a different answer when asked if she was worried. \\"Who wouldn't be?\\" she said. Last year, he scuttled plans to return home after the military warned him not to. \\"There were indications that they didn't want me to come, and my own colleagues told me not to come,\\" Musharraf said. \\"Therefore, I changed my mind.\\" This time, he said, he will be protected by government security and his private security agents. Musharraf landed in Karachi on a commercial airline. He said in a statement he would be accompanied by 200 expatriates from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. Arrest over Bhutto's killing. In 1999, Musharraf, then chief of Pakistan's army, became its president in a bloodless military coup. He remained in power until resigning five years ago, a period that included the U.S.-led invasion of neighboring Afghanistan. A few months before he left office, Benazir Bhutto -- who was Pakistan's first elected female prime minister -- was killed in a suicide bomb attack as she was wrapping up a campaign rally in Rawalpindi. The attack came months after she survived an assassination attempt in Karachi. Authorities want Musharraf arrested for not doing enough to protect Bhutto's life despite numerous threats. The former military ruler has denied having anything to do with the killing. A jail cell awaits. Last year, Pakistani authorities confiscated his property and froze his bank account. They have accused him of not declaring foreign bank accounts he had in his name. The Sindh province Home Ministry said last year that a jail cell awaited him in Karachi upon his return, . In Pakistan, the provincial Home Ministry, not the federal government, is responsible for such arrests. Musharraf defended his record last year, and said he did much to improve the nation's economy while he was in office. However, he has admitted to making mistakes. Disillusioned Pakistanis. Musharraf's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation's Supreme Court chief justice for \\"misuse of authority.\\" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence the court's ruling on whether he could seek another five-year term. Although the chief justice was reinstated, the damage was done. Pakistanis were also disillusioned with Musharraf's policies that led to shortages of essential food items, power cuts and skyrocketing inflation. However, under his leadership, Pakistan attained respectable economic growth rates and established a generally favorable investment climate. Along with that came a growing middle class, more aggressive news media, and a more assertive judiciary. 'Death squad' threat. Pakistan also disapproved of the way Musharraf carried out his end of the \\"war on terror\\" and used it as a crutch to explain away many of his unpopular moves. After the September 11, 2001, terror attacks against the United States, Musharraf supported the American war on terror and targeted the Taliban. The militants have accused him of pushing an American agenda in Pakistan. An opportune time. Musharraf's return comes at an opportune time. Last week, Pakistan marked the first time a democratically elected government has served a full five-year term in the country's 65-year history. While the ruling Pakistan People Party rode to power on the back of discontent with Musharraf, it had to deal with the same problems that plagued Musharraf: food shortages and power cuts. Five years is often enough time for a populace to forgive and forget. On Sunday, election officials named former chief justice Mir Hazar Khan Khoso as interim prime minister. He will head the caretaker administration through the May elections. It remains to be seen whether Pakistan, now soured by the PPP's reign, will welcome Musharraf back with open arms. Explosives-packed water tanker targets Pakistani military checkpoint; 17 killed. CNN's Leone Lakhani contributed to this report from Karachi. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The significant elements in this article are numerous, and include the following: 1. Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf returns from self-exile, after living over four years in London and Dubai, with the intention of running for office as the head of his party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, in the May elections. 2. Upon his arrival in Karachi, Musharraf declares that he returned to \\"save\\" Pakistan, despite facing numerous legal challenges and threats to his life, including a death squad from the Taliban. 3. Negative public opinion towards Musharraf started to grow in 2007 due to his policies that led to essential food items' insufficiencies, inflation, and power cuts. Significantly, his decision to suspend the Supreme Court's chief justice for \\"misuse of authority\\" led to widespread protests. 4. Nevertheless, Musharraf's regime saw decent economic growth rates, a burgeoning middle class, vibrant news media, and an assertive judiciary. His policies, however, were often considered as being proxied by American interests, especially after he supported the 'war on terror' following the 9/11 terror attacks, provoking the wrath of the Taliban. 5. Musharraf is linked with the assassination of Benazir Bhutto, the country's first elected female prime minister, for allegedly failing to protect her despite numerous threats. However, he denies any involvement in her killing. 6. Musharraf believes it is an opportune time for his return, given that Pakistan recently marked the first time a democratically elected government served a full term in its 65-year history. Previously, the current ruling party, the Pakistan People's Party, capitalized on public discontent towards Musharraf, yet then faced similar problems around food shortages and power cuts. 7. Lastly, the election officials declared former chief justice Mir Hazar Khan Khoso as the interim prime minister, who would lead the administration through the May elections.

Movie title: Tron: Legacy Context: 1989: Kevin Flynn (Jeff Bridges), now CEO of ENCOM, tells his seven year-old son, Sam (Owen Best), about his adventures in the Grid, a completely digital world within the Tron computer system that Flynn created. Flynn explains to Sam that, with his counterpart Clu (Jeff Bridges, body performance; John Reardon) - the second of a Codified Likeness Utility modeled after Flynn - and the security program Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), he discovered something amazing within the Grid; a miracle. Sam asks what it is but Flynn holds the story for next time before putting Sam to bed and going to work. A series of newspaper articles and television reports follow announcing the mysterious disappearance of Kevin Flynn after that night. Since the passing of Sam's mother (Amy Esterle) several years prior, Flynn's absence leaves him effectively orphaned and puts ENCOM's future in a state of jeopardy. Sam is left to stay with his paternal grandparents (Donnelly Rhodes and Belinda Montgomery), questioning the nature of his father's disappearance.20 years later, Sam (Garrett Hedlund) rides his motorcycle through the night streets towards ENCOM tower. He hacks into the building and evades security cameras as he makes his way upstairs.

Here is a question about this article: A watt balance is an instrument for comparing two powers, one of which is measured in SI watts and the other of which is measured in conventional electrical units. From the definition of the conventional watt W90, this gives a measure of the product KJ2RK in SI units, where RK is the von Klitzing constant which appears in the quantum Hall effect. If the theoretical treatments of the Josephson effect and the quantum Hall effect are valid, and in particular assuming that RK = h/e2, the measurement of KJ2RK is a direct determination of the Planck constant. What is the answer to this question: If the effects are valid, for RK = n/e2, what is the measurement of KJ2RK equal to?","completion":"Well kiddo, think of the watt balance like a very special kind of balance scale, but instead of comparing the weight of apples and oranges, it's comparing different types of power. Now, in this case, if the effects the article talks about are valid and working , and we say that RK (which is a very important constant used in doing these comparisons) equals n (a number) divided by e2 (which is another very important constant), then the measurement of KJ2RK would be a direct determination of what we call the Planck constant.

A blown fuse caused Tom's gas gauge to malfunction.","completion":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"A blown fuse caused Tom's gas gauge to malfunction,\\" can logically follow the preceding text. Here's an elaborated version of the story that includes this sentence: Tom was driving around, enjoying his day and completely unaware of any issues with his car. His gas gauge seemed to stay full, not going down at all, which he chucked up to his car's great fuel efficiency. However, unknown to Tom, this was a clear indication of a problem with his gas gauge, but he didn't realize that something was wrong. As Tom continued to drive, his car eventually broke down, leaving him stranded in the middle of the road. After getting assistance to move his vehicle to a safe location, he investigated the issue and discovered that his car had run out of gas. Tom was confused and surprised, as his gas needle always showed his fuel tank as full, even though he had traveled a considerable distance. Determined to solve this issue, Tom refilled his fuel tank to see if the gas needle would respond accordingly. To his dismay, it still showed a full tank, signaling a malfunction with his gas gauge. Tom sought the help of a mechanic to figure out the cause of this problem. After a thorough inspection, the mechanic found that a blown fuse had caused Tom's gas gauge to malfunction, and he informed Tom that it was a relatively common issue in vehicles. Once the blown fuse was replaced, Tom's gas gauge began functioning correctly, accurately displaying the fuel levels in his tank. Now aware of the dangers of not knowing his car's actual fuel level, Tom continued his driving with greater attention to maintaining his vehicle effectively. In conclusion, the sentence \\"A blown fuse caused Tom's gas gauge to malfunction\\" fits in with the story and adds a plausible explanation for Tom's gas gauge malfunction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meanwhile, a 19-year-old Sadako joins an acting troupe as an understudy as a therapy to her nightmares suggested by her doctor. Sadako has natural beauty and charisma for the play, infuriating her senior, Aiko Hazuki, whose relationship with the troupe director, Yusaku Shigemori, sours due to the latter's newfound favor for the young trainee. Aiko is later found murdered by a figure in white, thus Sadako takes her place for the upcoming play as the lead character. Sadako attracts and reciprocates the attention of the troupe sound director, Hiroshi Toyama, much to the disappointment of costume designer and Toyama's girlfriend, Etsuko Tachihara.

Title: The Killing Movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying.

Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J.

Read this: The elimination of wolves from Yellowstone National Park had profound impacts on the trophic pyramid. Without predation, herbivores began to over-graze many woody browse species, affecting the area's plant populations. In addition, wolves often kept animals from grazing in riparian areas, which protected beavers from having their food sources encroached upon. The removal of wolves had a direct effect on beaver populations, as their habitat became territory for grazing. Furthermore, predation keeps hydrological features such as creeks and streams in normal working order. Increased browsing on willows and conifers along Blacktail Creek due to a lack of predation caused channel incision because they helped slow the water down and hold the soil in place. What natural features work better when herbivores are present? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The question asks about the natural features that work better when herbivores are present. Herbivores play an essential role in maintaining the balance and health of ecosystems. When herbivores are present, several natural features work better, including: 1. Plant diversity: Herbivores help maintain plant diversity by consuming dominant plant species, which gives less competitive plant species a chance to grow. This promotes a rich and diverse plant community. 2. Nutrient cycling: By feeding on plants, herbivores consume nutrients and return them to the soil in the form of waste. This process enhances nutrient cycling, leading to increased plant growth and overall ecosystem productivity. 3. Seed dispersal: Some herbivores contribute to seed dispersal by consuming fruits and seeds, which are later excreted at different locations. This spread of seeds promotes the regrowth and expansion of various plant species. 4. Predator-prey balance: Herbivores serve as a food source for predators, such as wolves or large birds of prey. The presence of herbivores ensures food availability for predators, thereby maintaining a stable predator-prey balance in the ecosystem. 5. Habitat creation and maintenance: Herbivores can create and maintain habitats for other organisms by generating disturbances when grazing or browsing. This activity can lead to the creation of open spaces, which allows sunlight to penetrate and support the growth of different plant species. Additionally, these disturbances can foster the development of diverse habitats that can support a wide array of species. 6. Facilitating symbiotic relationships: Herbivores can play a part in promoting symbiotic relationships, such as the ones between plants and pollinators. By consuming plants, herbivores can create an environment that encourages the growth of flowering plants, which attract pollinators. In summary, the presence of herbivores in an ecosystem leads to various natural features functioning at their best, including plant diversity, nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, predator-prey balance, habitat creation and maintenance, and facilitating symbiotic relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The dead, who once lived in the town, inexplicably return to life with an overwhelming desire to cast their votes in the election. As the living residents grapple with this shocking revelation, they must decide whether to give the returning dead their chance to vote or deny them the opportunity and risk an unimaginable supernatural uproar. Act I: The movie opens in the picturesque town of Willowbrook, where the residents are divided over their political views. Tensions run high, with friendships strained and families torn apart. With just a few weeks left before the election, the town is plastered with campaign posters and signs advocating for the two leading candidates. On a quiet autumn evening, a grieving mother, Linda, visits the local cemetery to pay respect to her late teenage daughter, Sara, who passed away a year ago. As she leaves the cemetery, she witnesses the unthinkable: the dead rising from their graves. Act II: At first, the townspeople are terrified by the return of the dead, but soon they discover that the deceased only have one intention - to cast their votes in the election. The returning dead include influential figures from the town's history, some dating back several generations, as well as loved ones of the living residents. As word spreads about their singular mission, both political sides try to woo the newly reanimated voters. The town's administration, led by Mayor Simmons, is initially opposed to allowing the dead to vote, chaotically devising strategies and attempting to cover up the supernatural phenomena. However, Linda, along with her newfound friend - the local journalist David, decides to help the returning dead exercise their right to vote. Act III: With Linda and David's support, the issue of the dead's voting rights gains momentum. Together, they build a coalition of both living and dead citizens to pressure the Mayor and the oppositional forces to change the election rules and allow the deceased to cast their absentee ballots. The movie's climax occurs when the opposition, in a desperate attempt to suppress the rising supernatural vote, resorts to violence against Linda, David, and their supporters. In response, the ghostly citizens use their powers to intimidate and thwart the actions of the opposition. In the end, understanding the significance of democracy and the potential risks of denying the returning dead their right to participate, the election authorities accept the deceased's votes, and the town is brought together by this unexpected but unifying cause. The movie concludes with the returning dead fading back into the afterlife, having fulfilled their purpose. The experience leaves the town forever changed: a newfound respect for democracy, unity, and appreciation for life and voting rights."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\".

Corrina, Corrina is a 1994 American feature film set in 1959 about a widower (Ray Liotta) who hires a housekeeper/nanny (Whoopi Goldberg) to care for his daughter (Tina Majorino). It was written and directed by Jessie Nelson, in her feature film directing debut. It was the final film in which Don Ameche starred; he died shortly after filming was completed. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Corrina, Corrina was set in an odd-numbered year.\\"?","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in the paragraph above, we can conclude that \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" was set in an odd-numbered year. The paragraph states that the film is set in the year 1959, which is an odd-numbered year. The year 1959 is odd because it cannot be evenly divided by 2, resulting in a remainder when divided (1959 ÷ 2 = 979.5). In contrast, even-numbered years are divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. The film's setting is important to its storyline and the era in which the characters' lives unfold. Set in 1959, it presents a picture of the social and cultural norms of that time, which contribute to the film's narrative and create context for the audience to better understand and relate to the characters' experiences. The plot revolves around the protagonist, Ray Liotta, who plays a widower seeking a housekeeper and nanny to care for his daughter. This leads to Whoopi Goldberg's character, Corrina, entering their lives. Being set in the late 1950s, the social dynamics of the time are significant, as interracial relationships were less accepted and may have caused tension between characters and within their broader community. This adds depth to the story, making it more than simply the development of a personal bond between the characters. In summary, based on the information in the paragraph, we can indeed conclude that \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" was set in an odd-numbered year, specifically 1959. This setting shapes the storyline and provides a lens through which the audience can view and understand the characters' lives, relationships, and challenges they face in that era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"We don't have a conventional bomb that'll penetrate that.\\"\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"We don't have a conventional bomb that'll penetrate that.\\" can be translated as: \\"Nemáme konvenční bombu, která by to prorazila.\\" Here's a detailed breakdown of the translation: - Nemáme (We don't have): \\"Ne-\\" is a prefix used for negation, and \\"máme\\" is the first person plural form of \\"mít\\" (to have). Together, they form \\"Nemáme,\\" meaning \\"We don't have.\\" - konvenční (conventional): This adjective stays the same in Czech as it is derived from similar roots. It means \\"conventional\\" or \\"regular,\\" referring to the type of bomb. - bombu (bomb): This word is the accusative form of the noun \\"bomba\\" (bomb), which is the same in both English and Czech. The accusative form \\"bombu\\" is used because it is the direct object of the verb \\"mít\\" (to have). - která by (that'll): \\"Která\\" is the feminine form of the relative pronoun \\"který\\" (which, that), and \\"by\\" is a conditional auxiliary verb that can be translated as \\"would\\" or \\"will\\" in English. Together, they mean \\"that'll\\" or \\"which would.\\" - to (that): This pronoun is translated as \\"to\\" in Czech and refers to the object, barrier, or structure that the bomb should penetrate. - prorazila (penetrate): This verb comes from \\"prorazit\\" (to penetrate), and \\"prorazila\\" is the past feminine form of the verb. This form corresponds to the gender of the word \\"bomba\\" (bomb), which is feminine in Czech. Putting all of these words together, we get the Czech translation: \\"Nemáme konvenční bombu, která by to prorazila.\\" This sentence has the same meaning and context as the original English phrase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Because dizygotic twins develop from two eggs fertilized by two sperm, they are no more identical than siblings born at different times. Much less commonly, a zygote can divide into two separate offspring during early development. This results in the birth of monozygotic (or identical) twins. Although the zygote can split as early as the two-cell stage, splitting occurs most commonly during the early blastocyst stage, with roughly 70–100 cells present. These two scenarios are distinct from each other, in that the twin embryos that separated at the two-cell stage will have individual placentas, whereas twin embryos that form from separation at the blastocyst stage will share a placenta and a chorionic cavity.

Rouvas was born on 5 January 1972 in the village of Mandoukion, near Corfu City on the island of Corfu, the eldest of four sons of Konstantinos \\"Kostas\\" Rouvas (an ambulance driver) and the teenaged Anna-Maria Panaretou (a duty-free shop clerk at the local airport). He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. After moving to Patras, Rouvas continued to look for performance opportunities until he met Dakis (a popular Greek artist who was the first person to help him professionally). Rouvas moved to Athens, and made his first professional appearance in 1991 at the Show Centre. His showmanship attracted the attention of music executives such as Nikos Mouratidis, who encouraged songwriter Giorgos Pavrianos to produce him. Rouvas, singing Michael Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\" was discovered by PolyGram executives who signed him to his first recording contract. After moving to Athens he lived with an older English woman named Sally, with whom he had begun a relationship on Corfu. Their relationship ended when Psinakis became Rouvas' manager, and the singer became more career-oriented. The media has speculated about Rouvas' personal life and relationships with model Zeta Logotheti, Sofi Kantarou (a Corfu bar manager) and singer Elli Kokkinou. Several months later he debuted at the Thessaloniki Song Festival, losing Best Vocal Performance to Giorgos Alkaios but singing the Best Composition (\\"Par'ta\\"; \\"Take Them\\", with music by Nikos Terzis and lyrics by Giorgos Pavrianos). There was a brief earthquake during the festival. Rouvas released his eponymous debut album, which topped the Greek Albums Chart, the day after the festival. \\"Par'ta\\" became a radio hit, and other songs of the album such as \\"1992\\", \\"Ego S'agapo\\" (\\"I Love You\\") and \\"Gia Fantasou\\" (\\"Imagine\\") also became popular. In September 1992 Rouvas released his second album, Min Andistekese (Don't Resist), also composed by Nikos Terzis. It produced the singles \\"Gyrna\\" (\\"Return\\"), \\"Min Andistekese\\", \\"Na Ziseis Moro Mou\\" (\\"Live, My Baby\\") and \\"Me Kommeni Tin Anasa\\" (\\"Breathless\\"), with a music video of the title track.

It is distinguished from the term \\"comic book\\", which is used for comics periodicals. - An animator is an artist who creates multiple images, known as frames, which give an illusion of movement called animation when displayed in rapid sequence. Animators can work in a variety of fields including film, television, and video games. Animation is closely related to filmmaking and like filmmaking is extremely labor-intensive, which means that most significant works require the collaboration of several animators. The methods of creating the images or frames for an animation piece depends on the animators' artistic styles and their field. - The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California. It is the world's second largest media conglomerate in terms of revenue, after Comcast. Disney was founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt Disney and Roy O.

Select the topic that this about: The White House releases new records relating to a row over President Bush's military service.","completion":"The White House has recently released new records relating to a contentious issue involving President George W. Bush's military service. The issue comes from allegations that surfaced during his time in office, suggesting that President Bush may have benefited from special treatment or avoided certain obligations during his tenure in the Texas Air National Guard in the 1960s and 1970s. The controversy surrounding President Bush's military service has been a politically divisive topic for many years, with critics arguing that his connections and family influence allowed him to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. They believe that these new records may provide further insights or evidence, either supporting or refuting the claims made against President Bush. According to the documents released by the White House, President Bush enlisted in the Texas Air National Guard in 1968 and served until 1974, eventually attaining the rank of first lieutenant. The newly released records include payroll documents, medical records, and personal evaluations, shedding more light on President Bush's time in the National Guard. Several key points have been highlighted from these records: 1. The documents indicate that President Bush fulfilled the necessary training requirements and showed satisfactory performance during his time in the National Guard. They demonstrate that he was present for required weekend drills and annual training, despite claims that he had failed to meet these obligations. 2. The records also include a letter from Colonel Jerry B. Killian, commending President Bush for his service and expressing confidence in his abilities as a pilot. This challenges the allegations that Colonel Killian had previously criticized Bush's performance in the National Guard. 3. The medical records confirm that President Bush was grounded in 1972 for failing to complete a flight physical examination. However, they do not provide any indication that there was an ulterior motive for this grounding or that it was an attempt to avoid responsibilities. 4. The payroll documents released show that President Bush was paid for his service in the National Guard during the questioned period, further supporting the claim that he was present and fulfilled his duties. Critics of President Bush, however, remain unconvinced by these records, suggesting that they may have been selectively released or do not provide a comprehensive account of the former president's military service. They argue that questions still remain over Bush's failure to complete his flight physical examination, as well as his transfer to an Alabama National Guard unit while he was working on a political campaign, which some view as evidence of special treatment. The release of these new records relating to President Bush's military service has re-ignited the debate over his time in the Texas Air National Guard. While the documents provide additional information and seemingly support the claim that he met his obligations, critics maintain that the records do not definitively put the issue to rest. As such, the controversy surrounding the 43rd President of the United States' military service record is likely to continue for some time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many complaints. ||||| Jack Dorsey. The concept of the “shadowban” has existed practically since the inception of the web forum. The idea is simple: Instead of banning a user outright and informing them of such punishment, a shadowban makes a user’s post visible only to themselves. In other words, they think that they’re still part of a community, but nobody is able to see or interact with them. The shadowban is useful in that rather than someone immediately being locked out and possibly retaliating by, for example, making a new account, the user fades away gradually due to the lack of interaction from other users. As forums have evolved into social-media platforms, the shadowban and its descendants have come along with them. Facebook argued that the best way to dispel misinformation from places like Infowars, which argues that the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting was a staged hoax, was to secretly minimize their distribution in the site’s News Feed — a similar but not identical tactic. I myself have previously argued — tongue in cheek — that Twitter should shadowban (or “hellban”) President Donald Trump, who most recently threatened a cataclysmic war against Iran — the idea being that he gets the feeling of communicating with his followers while his actual posts are hidden from the (volatile) world. More than anywhere else, though, the shadowban has persisted among the conspiracy-minded, as a great weapon of censorship, generally thought to be perpetrated by liberal Silicon Valley operatives at the expense of conservatives. That right-wing voices are being “shadow banned” by Twitter and Facebook has become all but an article of faith among internet-native conservative activists and publishers — despite little evidence to support the claim. It’s no surprise, then, that a Vice News article claiming that Twitter is “shadow banning” Republicans has already taken hold in the minds of the most online right-wingers. At issue, though, is not “banning” but Twitter’s search mechanism. Usually, Twitter will automatically complete a search query and suggest an account when a user begins typing in Twitter’s search bar. If you type in “Donald,” for example, Trump’s account is displayed as an easily accessible hyperlink, so that you don’t have to click through to the results page; if you type in “Hillary,” you’ll get a similar autocomplete suggestion of Hillary Clinton. And what happens if you type in, as one so often does, “Andrew Surabian,” Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesperson and, in Vice’s words, a “prominent Republican”? According to Vice, Surabian and other “prominent Republicans” — like Republican Party chair Ronna McDaniel and a number of GOP lawmakers — are not being automatically suggested when you type in their names. All of these accounts, importantly, are still shown atop the actual search results page. The only problem is that you have to click through to it, instead of being given an easy autocomplete link. (Vice’s report is essentially a more partisan-focused repackaging of an article published by Gizmodo on Sunday, which covered how alt-right figures like Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler were also not appearing in auto-populated fields on Twitter. In some instances, parody accounts were featured in their stead.) To start with, and to state the most obvious, this sort of moderation isn’t shadow banning. Users following the affected accounts will still see their tweets; those accounts still appear in search (just not in the search-bar auto-population). “Shadow banning,” as generally imagined and described by the activists who claim they’ve been affected, would actively suppress user content even to followers, not just make accounts one click more difficult to find. Which is why, to the extent that this is even a problem, it’s pretty easy to come up with an alternate explanation: This is a side effect of a minimal measure designed to make sure that people aren’t preemptively encouraged to consume bad information from dubious sources. In May, Twitter announced that it would do what it could to ensure “people contributing to the healthy conversation will be more visible in conversations and search”; it seems eminently likely that an algorithmic strategy to make trolls and extremists less visible on the platform semi-accidentally ensnared some Republicans. (And can you blame it?) As HuffPost’s Ashley Feinberg pointed out on Twitter, well-known left-wing podcast hosts—surely, in the grand scheme of things, around the same level of “prominence” as Don Jr.’s spokesperson—are suffering from the same “problem” of being marginally more difficult to be searched out. Vice quotes a Twitter spokesperson saying that the company is “shipping a change,” but that the “technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.” New York Law School professor Ari Ezra Waldman told Vice that, “This isn’t evidence of a pattern of anti-conservative bias, since some Republicans still appear and some don’t. This just appears to be a cluster of conservatives who have been affected.” He added, “If anything, it appears that Twitter’s technology for minimizing accounts instead of banning them just isn’t very good.” That’s a more likely scenario than a cabal of secretive Twitter employees trying to suppress the speech of … Donald Trump Jr.’s spokesperson. Is it bad? Sure, the way a hangnail is bad. But it’s not censorship, and it’s certainly not “shadow-banning.” It’s well-established that right-wing media and personalities hew further to the right, and are consequently more likely than their left-wing counterparts to interact with fringe accounts (the kind of signal that would indicate to Twitter’s algorithm that an account is a troll or harasser), if not actually spread falsehoods and sensationalized outrage. But in framing this issue as the “Republicans being treated differently than Democrats” instead of “minimizing falsehoods and bad faith,” Vice has given conservatives even more ammo with which to claim oppression. The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American. Twitter owes the public answers to what’s really going on. https://t.co/i9UtbxJrt0 — Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) July 25, 2018 Vice’s story feels an awful lot like one reported two years ago by Gizmodo, which claimed that Facebook was “suppressing conservatives.” In reality, Facebook’s editors were making the editorial judgment call that manufactured, misleading, and hyperpartisan stories from conservative outlets — such as ones about Benghazi, in 2016 — were less relevant to Facebook’s users than breaking stories from mainstream outlets. Similarly, Twitter’s new system seems less about suppressing conservative viewpoints and more about minimizing controversial figures whose primary tactic is to stoke outrage through heavy slant or outright distortion. ||||| Presented with screenshots of the searches, a Twitter spokesperson told VICE News: “We are aware that some accounts are not automatically populating in our search box and shipping a change to address this.” Asked why only conservative Republicans appear to be affected and not liberal Democrats, the spokesperson wrote: “I'd emphasize that our technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.” “The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American,” McDaniel told VICE News in a statement. “Twitter owes the public answers to what’s really going on.” Democrats are not being “shadow banned” in the same way, according to a VICE News review. McDaniel’s counterpart, Democratic Party chair Tom Perez, and liberal members of Congress — including Reps.

Democrats are not being “shadow banned” in the same way, according to a VICE News review. McDaniel’s counterpart, Democratic Party chair Tom Perez, and liberal members of Congress — including Reps. Maxine Waters, Joe Kennedy III, Keith Ellison, and Mark Pocan — all continue to appear in drop-down search results. Not a single member of the 78-person Progressive Caucus faces the same situation in Twitter’s search. “The notion that social media companies would suppress certain political points of view should concern every American,” McDaniel told VICE News in a statement. “Twitter owes the public answers to what’s really going on.” Presented with screenshots of the searches, a Twitter spokesperson told VICE News: “We are aware that some accounts are not automatically populating in our search box and shipping a change to address this.” Asked why only conservative Republicans appear to be affected and not liberal Democrats, the spokesperson wrote: “I'd emphasize that our technology is based on account *behavior* not the content of Tweets.” Twitter directed VICE News to a May 15 blog post that explained the company’s new approach to combating “troll-like behaviors.” After making changes to its platform, the company said that “[t]he result is that people contributing to the healthy conversation will be more visible in conversations and search.” Twitter did not respond to a follow-up question. Twitter’s troll hunt, however, has ensnared some of the most prominent Republicans in the country. Type in the names of McDaniel, conservative members of Congress like Reps. Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, and Matt Gaetz, and Trump Jr.’s spokesman Andrew Surabian, for example, and Twitter’s drop-down search bar does not show their profiles. The search menu also does not display the verified profile of Rep. Devin Nunes of California, only his unverified one that he seldom uses to post. That limits their visibility and the ease of finding their profiles compared to their liberal counterparts. The company’s drop-down search bar has also been excluding several prominent racist figures on the alt-right, such as Jason Kessler, who organized last year’s white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The platform has also demoted a smattering of far-right figures like Mike Cernovich, as Gizmodo reported earlier this week. But the rationale determining which accounts auto-populate in search results and which don’t is unclear. InfoWars and its leader Alex Jones have not been demoted despite often spreading false news and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example. Republican Rep. Steve King — who has tweeted that immigration should be limited because “we can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies” — also appears to be unaffected by this change to the company’s search function. He retweeted a self-proclaimed “Nazi sympathizer” last month and declined to take it down when notified of the person’s history. “This isn’t evidence of a pattern of anti-conservative bias since some Republicans still appear and some don’t. This just appears to be a cluster of conservatives who have been affected,” said New York Law School Professor Ari Ezra Waldman, who testified at the House Judiciary Committee’s April hearing on social media filtering and is the author of Privacy as Trust: Information Privacy for an Information Age. “If anything, it appears that Twitter’s technology for minimizing accounts instead of banning them just isn’t very good.” Even if the shadow banning is more of a bug than a feature, the demotion of these prominent Republicans could be a political liability for the social media company. Conservatives in and out of Congress have been claiming for months — with varying amounts of evidence — that Big Tech companies are censoring voices on the right. The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee convened not one but two hearings on the subject in recent months, including one with pro-Trump social media stars Diamond and Silk, who argued that Facebook had been intentionally diminishing the reach of their content. The second hearing went down just last week where representatives from Twitter, Google, and Facebook were subjected to grilling by conservatives. “It is curious that these allegations would arise the week following Congressman Gaetz’s heated exchange with Twitter senior executives before the House Judiciary Committee,” a spokesman for Gaetz told VICE News. The allegations of bias haven’t been limited to Congress either. McDaniel and President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote a letter to Facebook and Twitter in June asking for the companies to conduct public reviews of potential bias against conservative content on the platform. “We are alarmed by numerous allegations that Facebook has blocked content from conservative journalists and groups, and Twitter has hidden such content from conservative users’ followers,” they wrote. An RNC spokesperson told VICE News that Twitter has yet to respond to McDaniel but that Facebook reached out to set up a meeting. Democrats, for their part, have largely rolled their eyes at conservative claims of discrimination. At Diamond and Silk's hearing in April, the committee’s top-ranking Democrat Jerrold Nadler called the idea of Big Tech censorship of conservatives a “hoax” and a “tired narrative of imagined victimhood” that was eclipsing other priorities like election security and online privacy. But Facebook and Twitter have appeared to take the conservative criticism seriously and have arranged a series of meetings and public reviews aimed to build up trust with influential figures on the right. Despite some evidence that Diamond and Silk were exaggerating their claims, Facebook publicly apologized to the duo in front of Congress last week. And Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey convened a D.C. dinner on June 19 with prominent conservatives including White House advisor Mercedes Schlapp, Fox News commentator Guy Benson, and tax activist Grover Norquist, as the Washington Post first reported. But the black box of the platforms’ changes still has conservatives wary. “This type of opaque behavior by social media companies is exactly why conservatives are speaking out and demanding more transparency and accountability,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California told VICE News in a statement. “The bias has to stop.” Follow Alex Thompson on Twitter at @AlxThomp.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) |||||Summary:","completion":"This long article talks about a big argument happening right now about a thing called \\"shadow banning.\\" Shadow banning is like a secret time out that some people say places like Twitter and Facebook are giving to people they don't agree with, stopping everyone else from seeing their posts. It's like they've become a ghost on the website, they can still post and do things, but no one else can see or interact with them. Usually, people say this time out is given without any warning or explanation, and it is said to make people lose interest and slowly stop using the website, without knowing they've been put in a time out. The whole argument started because some people noticed that when they searched for some important people in the Republican party (which is one of the two main political parties in the U.S.), Twitter didn't suggest these people in their search bar dropdown. This made it harder for people to find these important accounts because they had to click into the search results page to see them. Some people say this is shadow banning because it makes these important people less visible, while others think it's not that serious and could just be due to a glitch or something else in Twitter's system. A lot of people in the Republican party are upset about this because they think Twitter and other big tech companies are purposefully hiding or pushing down their views. The Democrats (the other big political party in the U.S.) don't seem to be having the same issues, hence the accusations of bias. Twitter has said they're going to fix the issue and that this isn't because they disagree with what these people are saying, but because of how these accounts behave on the platform. They did not go into much detail on what \\"behavior\\" they mean though. There's still a lot of discussion and disagreement about this, and some people don't even think this shadow banning thing is real. But a lot of people are watching closely to see what Twitter and other companies will do about it. In simple terms, it's like if you're at a playground and you're playing a game of tag, but the person who is \\"it\\" decides not to tag you and doesn't tell you why. You keep running around thinking you're still playing, but nobody else can tag you or interact with you in the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: The boy was too nervous to dance, so what was he doing progressively at the ball? Options: - dance like crazy - standing still - wallflower - stand still - like dancing The answer is \\"standing still\\" because Answer:","completion":"The boy was too nervous to dance at the ball, and the best option describing his behavior is \\"standing still.\\" The reason for this is due to a combination of social anxiety, feelings of self-consciousness, and the general pressure of participating in a large event. The other options provided do not accurately portray his actions given the situation. Dancing like crazy would not make sense as the boy is too nervous to dance at the ball. This option contradicts the premise of the question. Most people experiencing nervousness in social gatherings would not suddenly dance energetically, as it would draw attention and could potentially make them feel even more anxious. Being a wallflower is quite similar to standing still but is not an action in itself. A wallflower refers to someone who stands or sits quietly on the sidelines of an event, typically due to shyness or lack of skill in social interactions. However, the term is more of a descriptor rather than a specific action that the boy would be performing. Stating \\"stand still\\" is grammatically incorrect, as it should be \\"standing still,\\" which is the correct answer presented. When someone is too nervous, they are likely to stand still, avoiding eye contact and movements that might draw attention to them. Standing still suggests that the boy is so anxious about dancing that he chooses to remain immobile, not participating in the ball's activities. Finally, \\"like dancing\\" is also an inaccurate answer. If the boy was too nervous to dance, he would not be doing anything resembling dancing. In this case, \\"like dancing\\" could imply swaying or moving slightly to the music, which would not accurately represent the extreme nervousness the boy is experiencing. In conclusion, the answer is \\"standing still\\" because the boy's nervousness prevents him from participating in any form of dancing or engaging in social interactions during the ball. His anxiety results in immobility and withdrawn behavior as a coping mechanism. This option highlights the boy's reluctance to dance and how his feelings of trepidation impact his behavior at the event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Paragraph: Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth. Question: \\"Who gave the Muslims the idea of partition?\\" Answer: \\"Muhammad Ali Jinnah\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, this answer is not entirely correct. While Muhammad Ali Jinnah played a leading role in the Muslim campaign for Partition, it was the poet Muhammad Iqbal who first proposed the idea of a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India in 1930. The concept of Pakistan was later coined by a small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge. Jinnah, a London-trained Bombay lawyer, led the movement for Partition, but he did not originate the idea."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Această traducere susține ideea că o concurență justă pe plan internațional poate fi obținută numai atunci când economia globală respectă anumite principii fundamentale care să guverneze relațiile dintre diferitele părți interesate. Printre aceste principii se numără stabilirea unor reguli transparente și coerente pentru producători, exportatori și importatori, care să fie valabile la nivel mondial. Mai mult, este important de luat în considerare faptul că atingerea unei concurențe corecte ar trebui să cuprindă și preocupări legate de bunăstarea socială și de sustenabilitatea mediului.

A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground.

In this task, you are given a review of a movie and a boolean question whether this review has positive sentiment or negative sentiment. Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Review: For real film people, this film is a must, since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves. Janos Rukh/Boris Karloff's science has to do with capturing and projecting light from cosmic phenomena. This light can do harm, or it can be harnessed to do good. On the one hand it blinds his mother, on the other it is used to cure blindness (\\"I can see!\\" shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected). When Rukh/Karloff is himself poisoned by the uncanny power of this light, we see him actually emitting a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative, drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection, an entity viewed on film (only visible, as in a movie theater, when the lights are out).There is a wonderful passage near the beginning where Karloff/Rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years, as the light from Andromeda was emitted from that Galaxy at a time when the earth was still molten rock. There are passages in the film when this new science is juxtaposed to older cultural vehicles: that of the writer, in the persona of Beulah Bondi/Arabella Stevens; and religion, emblemized in the sculptural figures on the local cathedral Karloff blasts with his projector/ray gun. One has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in Germany at the time, and particularly at Riefenstall's use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm:Triumph of the Will. Happily in the end, Mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) intervenes, reminding Janos Rukh of the first rule of science.

Please answer the following question: Q: Most oxygen in blood is bound to a protein called what, and carried to the tissues? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Transport of Oxygen in the Blood Although oxygen dissolves in blood, only a small amount of oxygen is transported this way. Only 1.5 percent of oxygen in the blood is dissolved directly into the blood itself. Most oxygen—98.5 percent—is bound to a protein called hemoglobin and carried to the tissues. Hemoglobin Hemoglobin, or Hb, is a protein molecule found in red blood cells (erythrocytes) made of four subunits: two alpha subunits and two beta subunits (Figure 39.19). Each subunit surrounds a central heme group that contains iron and binds one oxygen molecule, allowing each hemoglobin molecule to bind four oxygen molecules. Molecules with more oxygen bound to the heme groups are brighter red. As a result, oxygenated arterial blood where the Hb is carrying four oxygen molecules is bright red, while venous blood that is deoxygenated is darker red.

(CNN) -- Canadian police on Friday identified the victim of a grisly killing in Montreal as a university student from China who was reported missing by a friend earlier this week. Jun Lin, 33, was attending Concordia University in Montreal, said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. He was last seen May 24. Police believe the murder took place May 24 or May 25 The Chinese consulate in Montreal said Lin was from the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Police believe Lin was killed and his body dismembered in a Montreal apartment. A massive international manhunt is ongoing for the prime suspect, Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, a self-professed porn star. In apartment 208, where","completion":"the murder is believed to have taken place, a disturbing scene awaited investigators. Bloodstains covered the walls and floor, and the strong odor of decomposition filled the air. A grisly video on the internet of the alleged murder led police to the apartment, where they found human remains, including a torso in a suitcase, in the building's garbage area. As the manhunt for Magnotta continued, details of his life emerged, painting a picture of a deeply troubled and dangerous individual. Magnotta was known to have a history of animal abuse, posting videos of himself torturing kittens. He had also been linked to several online personas, each more bizarre and gruesome than the next. After an intense search by Canadian police, the international manhunt for Magnotta finally came to an end in a Berlin internet café. On June 4, 2012, an employee at the café recognized the wanted suspect and alerted the authorities. Magnotta tried to convince the police that he was someone else, but after fingerprint checks and his distinctive tattoos matched, it was confirmed that they had the prime suspect in their custody. Magnotta was soon extradited back to Canada to face justice for his crimes. He was charged with first-degree murder, committing an indignity to a dead body, and mailing obscene and indecent material. During his trial, the prosecution detailed the horrific nature of Lin's murder and dismemberment and provided evidence linking Magnotta to the crime, including the receipt of the package sent to several high-profile figures. As the trial went on, it became clear that Magnotta's defense would be centered around his mental state at the time of the murder. His defense counsel argued that their client was psychotic and suffering from a personality disorder, making him not criminally responsible for his actions. While the prosecution refuted this claim, stating that Magnotta meticulously planned and carefully executed this brutal crime. Following weeks of testimony and deliberation, on December 23, 2014, the jury ultimately found Luka Rocco Magnotta guilty of first-degree murder and the other charges brought against him. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25 years. Additionally, he received 19 years for other crimes he committed, to be served concurrently. This case left a deep impact on the Chinese community, as well as the Canadian public and international community. Justice had been served, and Magnotta would spend a significant part of his life behind bars for the gruesome murder of Jun Lin. Meanwhile, the victim's family would have to carry on without their beloved family member, who was taken from them so tragically. The loss of Jun Lin and the horrifying events surrounding his murder continue to serve as a stark reminder of the darkness that can exist within some individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End.

These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth.

However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

He wants to be treated fairly. A:","completion":"Title: The Quest for Fair Play Genre: Drama, Adventure Plot Summary: Ahmed, a young man from a small town, dreams of making the world a better place by promoting fairness and equality. Frustrated by the constant discrimination and injustice he experiences and witnesses around him, Ahmed embarks on an epic quest, battling the forces of darkness and uncovering age-old secrets that could change the world forever. Plot: Ahmed is a kind-hearted and ambitious young man, living in a small, close-knit community in a remote town. He has a strong sense of justice and becomes increasingly frustrated by the prejudice and discrimination he encounters in his day-to-day life. The people in his town are divided along racial, religious, and economic lines, and Ahmed feels compelled to do something to create unity and fairness among them. One day, as Ahmed is reading ancient scrolls in the local library, he comes across a mysterious prophecy that recounts the tale of a hero who will bring fairness to the world by retrieving the long-lost \\"Chalice of Equality.\\" This magical item is said to possess the power to unite people and create harmony among those who hold it. Intrigued and inspired by this prophecy, Ahmed decides that he is the one destined to find the Chalice and restore fairness to the land. Ahmed embarks on a life-changing journey filled with adventure, supernatural encounters, and a battle between good and evil. He is accompanied by a group of friends, each of whom hails from a different cultural and socio-economic background. Along the way, they break down stereotypes, learn from each other's experiences, and help each other overcome personal fears and challenges. Throughout his quest, Ahmed faces various obstacles and enemies who wish to maintain the status quo of division and oppression. He and his friends must rely on their wits, courage, and the spirit of inclusiveness to succeed in their mission. In one intense scene, they come face-to-face with the manifestation of bigotry itself, a dark and fearsome creature who is intent on keeping the world divided. The climax of the film sees Ahmed and his friends find and unlock the hidden chamber containing the Chalice of Equality. As Ahmed retrieves the Chalice, its power floods through him, and he gains newfound abilities to heal and bring life to barren lands. Returning to his home town, Ahmed puts the Chalice to good use, cultivating fairness and unity within the once-divided community. In the closing scene, Ahmed reflects on his journey and the true meaning of fairness, acknowledging that change starts within oneself. Empowered by his experiences and the strength of his friends, Ahmed pledges to continue his fight for equality and justice at a national and global level, knowing that the power of the Chalice lies not just in the item itself, but in the hands of those who wield it with compassion. The film, \\"The Quest for Fair Play,\\" serves as an allegory for the power of unity, acceptance, and understanding in the face of prejudice and division. By portraying a diverse and inclusive group of characters on a hero's journey, the film delivers an inspiring and thought-provoking message about the importance of treating everyone fairly and working together to create a better world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Updated on July 26 at 5:00pm Continue Reading Below The Organic Consumers Association announced Tuesday that it found traces of glyphosate—a controversial herbicide found in Monsanto’s (MON) Roundup—in 10 of 11 samples of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, which was first reported by The New York Times. The levels, however, are far below the ceiling set by the Environmental Protection Agency. But the news comes as a surprise to many consumers since the company has been marketing itself as non-GMO since 2014. Though, according to Ben & Jerry’s website, they based their non-GMO standard on the “mandatory declaration requirements of European regulations and the GMO labeling law passed in [their] home state of Vermont,” which allows their dairy and egg suppliers to use conventional animal feeds that contain GMO grains. Rob Michalak, global director of social mission at Ben & Jerry’s, told The New York Times, that while they are working to ensure all ingredients in its supply chain come from sources that do not include any GMOs, none of its plant-based ingredients come from any GMO crops, such as corn or soy. Additionally, the company is trying to figure out a more cost-effective way for dairy farms that supply its milk to use non-GMO feed. “We’re working to transition away from GMO, as far away as we can get,” Michalak told The New York Times. “But then these tests come along, and we need to better understand where the glyphosate they’re finding is coming from. Maybe it’s from something that’s not even in our supply chain, and so we’re missing it.” Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT While the levels of glyphosate were well below the legal limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) argues that any presence of the pesticide product is misleading to the consumer. \\"It's time for Ben & Jerry’s to announce it will immediately begin transitioning to 100 percent organic. Otherwise conscious consumers have no choice but to launch a national and, if necessary, international protest campaign and boycott,” the OCA said in a post on its website. Additionally, the OCA says reports published by Regeneration Vermont reveal that Ben & Jerry’s suppliers—and Vermont and U.S. (non-organic) dairy farmers in general, “have gone backwards, rather than forward over the past 15 years in terms of environment sustainability, food safety, and nutrition and greenhouse gas pollution.” The organization has also called on the company to stop labeling its ice cream as “natural.” GMOs, specifically glyphosate, have been a hot-button issue for consumers in recent years. In 2015, the World Health Organization classified glyphosate as a “probable carcinogen” and last month, California became the first state to require Roundup—because its main ingredient is glyphosate—to come with a label warning that it’s known to cause cancer. However, Monsanto, the maker of Roundup, has hard-fought any criticisms regarding the herbicide. \\"Hundreds of scientific studies over 40 years have determined that glyphosate is safe for use, and no regulatory agency in the world has concluded that glyphosate is carcinogenic. IARC's flawed classification is the sole outlier,\\" Monsanto's vice president of strategy, Scott Partridge, told FOX Business. Additionally, a Ben & Jerry's spokesperson fired back and told FOX Business that while they're aware of the recent New York Times article, they have not yet seen the results, but they can confirm that \\"all Ben & Jerry's products are safe to consume.\\" \\"Even if the reported results are accurate, as the laboratory that conducted the test stated, a person would have to conume 145,000 eight-ounce servings PER DAY to reach the limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),\\" a Ben & Jerry's spokesperson said. ||||| We’ve based our non-GMO standard on the mandatory declaration requirements of European regulations and the GMO labeling law passed in our home state of Vermont. Our dairy and egg suppliers still use conventional animal feeds that contain GMO grains. We are actively seeking cost-effective options for farmers within our supply chain to convert to non-GMO animal feed. We reached this non-GMO milestone in 2014 when we completed the transition of all plant-based ingredients in all* of our ice cream flavors to non-GMO. The Details As a part of our commitment to transparency, and for those folks who really like to know the details, below is an explanation of exactly what we mean by 'non-GMO.' Our Definitions When we refer to a \\"GMO\\", we are using this term as most popularly used and widely understood in the US (though there are varying definitions). As such, a \\"GMO\\" (or \\"genetically modified organism\\") is an organism that has been created using gene-splicing techniques, which allow DNA from one species to be injected into another species in a laboratory. This creates combinations of plant, animal, bacteria, and viral genes that do not occur in nature or through traditional cross-breeding methods. \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" refers to non-GMO according to the original seed source. Either the crop is not commercially available as a GMO crop or, if the option is available, refers to the non-GMO version. Traceability to the original non-GMO seed source is key. This is the standard that Ben & Jerry's adheres to when sourcing our ingredients. \\"Non-GMO by IP\\" refers to non-GMO Identity Preserved crops. Identity Preservation requires practices and processes for controlling contamination from at-risk GMO inputs and ingredients. Traceability, segregation, risk assessment, sampling techniques, quality control management and analytical testing are emphasized. Ben & Jerry's does not require this from our suppliers, but many choose to supply ingredients that meet this standard. This is a standard that is slightly more rigid than Non-GMO by Origin, and therefore anything considered Non-GMO IP is also considered Non-GMO by Origin. \\"PCR Testing\\" refers to the Polymerase Chain Reaction test that can be used to detect genetic material (DNA) in a sample. PCR(-) refers to an ingredient that was derived from a GMO source, but the genetic material is not detectable in the finished product, likely due to it being a highly refined or processed product. PCR(-) alone is not an acceptable standard for Ben & Jerry's ingredients, but will be used as a verification tool when appropriate. Ben & Jerry's \\"Non-GMO\\" standards: Ben & Jerry's adheres to sourcing \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" ingredients for use in our products based on the following standards. This means we rely primarily on traceability of ingredients through the supply chain back to a non-GMO seed, rather than relying on PCR testing. Our suppliers use the following guidelines to ensure the ingredients they provide to us are \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\": - All suppliers must use \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" ingredients, (including any sub-components or excepients) in the manufacture of items they supply to Ben & Jerry's. - \\"Non-GMO by IP\\" is also acceptable. - For any plant-based raw material derived from sugar beets, corn, soy, canola, or other crop that is commercially available in GMO varieties, suppliers must source \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" materials. - Suppliers to Ben & Jerry's that also handle GMO raw materials or finished products in their production facilities must take appropriate measures to segregate GMO and Non-GMO materials at all times and ensure proper cleaning measures are employed. There may be no comingling of ingredients or finished products at any point during storage or processing. There is no tolerance for use of GMO ingredients in any product supplied to Ben & Jerry's. - Suppliers may use ingredients obtained from fermentation and processing aids or enzymes that are derived from GMOs in some circumstances, to be approved on a case-by-case basis by Ben & Jerry's. - Suppliers will be audited for \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" traceability and segregation compliance as part of Ben & Jerry's audit procedures. Supportive documentation review, site visits, and PCR testing at any point in the supply chain, may be part of the audit protocol. Suppliers must provide documentation and certification that materials are \\"Non-GMO by Origin\\" upon request. Our Dairy: We've based our non-GMO standard on the mandatory declaration requirements of European regulations and the GMO labeling law passed by our home state of Vermont. This standard does not address animal feed. To be clear, the fresh milk and cream we source from family farmers is conventionally sourced. It is common practice for dairy cows' feed to contain GMO ingredients such as corn and soy. We aspire to build a sustainable dairy supply chain in the Northeast region that does not use GMO feeds. We are working with numerous companies in the dairy industry and in the major commodity chains toward that goal through our participation in the Non-GMO Supply Working Group and Northeast Dairy Project. ||||| The Vermont brand has been built on a bucolic image of cows grazing on endless pastures . . . Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and other Vermont companies have used this idyllic imagery to sell their products. Gone are the days, however, when most of Vermont’s cows were grazing in spectacularly scenic landscapes. Now a majority of Vermont’s cows are locked up in . . . ‘confined animal feeding operations’ or CAFOs . . . grazing on concrete with a diet rich in GMO corn and pesticides. - “Vermont’s GMO Addiction: Pesticides, Polluted Water and Climate Destruction,” Regeneration Vermont The most important thing we can do today as conscious consumers, farmers and food workers is to regenerate public health, the environment and climate stability. We can do this most readily by moving away from industrial, GMO and factory-farm food toward an organic, pasture-based, soil-regenerative, humane, carbon-sequestering and climate-friendly agriculture system. What’s standing in the way of this life-or-death transformation? Rampant greenwashing. The proliferation of 90 billion worth of fraudulently labeled or advertised “natural” and “socially responsible” food products in the U.S. confuses even the most well-intentioned of consumers and lures them away from purchasing genuine organic or grass-fed products. Perhaps no company personifies greenwashing more than Vermont-based Ben & Jerry’s. Ben & Jerry’s history—a start-up launched by two affable hippies, from a renovated gas station in Burlington, Vt., —is legendary. Despite selling out to Unilever in April 2000, the brand’s handlers have preserved its quirky, homespun image, and masterfully convinced consumers that Ben & Jerry’s has never strayed from its mission: “to make the world a better place.” As the New York Times reports, the Organic Consumers Association (OCA) recently sent samples of Ben and Jerry’s top-selling ice cream brands to an independent testing lab for analysis. Ten out of 11 samples tested positive for Roundup (glyphosate and AMPA) herbicide contamination So much for making the world a better place. Compare the Ben & Jerry's test results with the results of our testing of organic brands, brands that use organic milk from farms that are actually making the world a better place. Three out of four nationally distributed organic ice cream brands tested negative for Roundup contamination (only Whole Foods “365” brand was contaminated). A history of stalling on organic Twenty-four years ago, anti-GMO food activists, including the Pure Food Campaign (OCA’s predecessor), successfully pressured Ben & Jerry’s and a number of other leading dairies to prohibit the use of America’s first genetically engineered food product, Monsanto’s recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH). Now marketed by drug giant Elanco (Eli Lilly), rBGH is linked to increased risk of human breast and colon cancer, a greater use of antibiotics in animal feed, and damage to cow’s health. Several groups, including the OCA, subsequently asked Ben & Jerry’s to move beyond just prohibiting their dairy cows from being injected with rBGH. We asked them to go 100 percent organic, which would have required the company to ban its dairy suppliers from feeding their cows GMO corn and grain, and to use only organic ingredients in its flavors. But even before Ben & Jerry’s was bought out by Unilever, company founder Ben Cohen told Vermont Food activist Michael Colby “that Ben & Jerry’s was not going to transition to organic because it wouldn’t allow them to ‘maximize profits.’ “ Since 1994, Ben & Jerry’s, the 1.5-billion-per-year flagship brand of the second-largest multinational food corporation in the world, Unilever (annual sales 60 billion), has cashed in big time on its “rBGH-free” policy, advertising its brand, over and over again, as “all natural,” “GMO-free,” “fair trade,” “climate-just,” and “socially responsible.” Despite repeated calls from consumer groups to stop advertising its ice-cream as “natural” or “all natural,” given that it is derived from cows raised almost exclusively on GMO corn forage (grown with Roundup Ready, neonic-, and BT-spliced seeds), laced with non-organic ingredients, sprayed heavily with Roundup and other pesticides, Ben & Jerry’s continues to greenwash and lie. The company recently (June 18, 2017) described its mission as: To make, distribute and sell the finest quality and euphoric concoctions with a continued commitment to incorporating wholesome, ingredients and promoting business practices that respect the Earth and the Environment. After more than a decade of dodging consumer, farmer, animal welfare, environmental and farmworker pleas to stop greenwashing and to equitably source its milk from cows grazing on organic pasture, Ben & Jerry’s continues to stall. Instead, Ben & Jerry’s sources its milk from St. Alban’s, a 400-farmer dairy co-op that is increasingly dominated by large factory farm-type dairy operations. To feed their cows, farmers routinely spray tons of pesticides, including Roundup, atrazine and metolachlor, on fields of GMO corn grown from neonic-coated and BT toxin seeds. They also apply tons of soil-killing, climate-disrupting nitrogen fertilizers that pollute Vermont’s streams, rivers and lakes. Petitions and protests calling for Ben & Jerry’s to stop its suppliers from exploiting farmworkers, confining dairy cows and driving small dairy farmers into bankruptcy, have produced nothing more than vague promises of “respecting the Earth” and supporting rural economic justice. Enough is enough. Vermont and national public interest organizations have lost our patience. It’s time for Unilever and Ben & Jerry’s to move beyond greenwashing to decisive action. It’s time for Ben & Jerry’s to announce it will immediately begin transitioning to 100-percent organic. Otherwise conscious consumers have no choice but to launch a national and, if necessary, international protest campaign and boycott. Vermont activists demand major changes from Ben and Jerry’s Regeneration Vermont, a broad-based coalition of consumers and farmers, has repeatedly asked Ben & Jerry’s and Unilever to sign a six-point pledge to go 100-percent organic over a three-year transition period. Here's what the groups want Ben & Jerry's to pledge: A transition away from GMO crops and toxic pesticides/fertilizers and toward regenerative organic agricultural methods. Fair wages for farmers, including premiums based on regeneration benchmarks and assistance in the transition toward regenerative methods. Economic justice for farm workers, fair and livable wages, decent housing and social and cultural dignity. Adoption of climate remediation techniques, beginning with an emphasis on healthy soils and cover-cropping for carbon sequestration and erosion control. Humane treatment of farm animals, a phase-out of confinement dairies and a transition back to grassland grazing and grass-based feed for ruminants. Cleaning up and protecting our watersheds, streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, and groundwater. A trail of toxins Recent reports published by Regeneration Vermont reveal that Ben & Jerry’s suppliers, and Vermont and U.S. (non-organic) dairy farmers in general, have gone backward, rather than forward over the past 15 years in terms of environmental sustainability, food safety, nutrition, greenhouse gas pollution, water pollution, animal welfare, farmworker justice, and preservation of family farms. Chemical fertilizer use has also almost doubled in Vermont since GMOs began to dominate the market 15 years ago. So much for Monsanto’s claims that GMO crops would reduce the use of toxic pesticides and water- polluting and climate-destabilizing nitrogen fertilizers. Not to mention Ben & Jerry’s claim that it is “non-GMO” and “environmentally responsible.” Among Regeneration Vermont’s finding are the following: An astounding 97 percent of Vermont’s field corn, the major component of a non-organic dairy cow’s diet, is now GMO (Roundup Ready, Bt-spliced, neonic seeds). This is the highest percentage of any state in the U.S. Herbicide use has increased over 100 percent-per-acre in Vermont since Monsanto’s GMO corn came on the market, with recent heavy use of atrazine, metholachlor, simazine, pendimethlin, glyphosate (Roundup), acetochlor, dicamba and alachlor. As Regeneration Vermont states in its report: Regulators have determined that five of these eight most used herbicides [in Vermont] are possible or probable human carcinogens, the remaining three are suspected carcinogens. Seven of the eight are possible or probable endocrine disruptors (the other one is a suspected to be an endocrine disruptor). All eight have been determined by regulators and academics to cause birth or developmental defects and contaminate drinking water and public waters with dangerous chemicals that have long-term persistence. Atrazine, simazine, acetachlor, and alachlor have lost their registration in the EU, and are effectively banned. The threat of #DirtyDairy and factory farms Millions of health-minded Americans, especially parents of young children, now understand that cheap, non-organic, genetically engineered, industrial and factory farm food is hazardous. Not only does chemical- and energy-intensive factory farming destroy the environment, destabilize the climate, impoverish rural communities, exploit farm workers, inflict unnecessary cruelty on farm animals, and contaminate the water supply, but the end product itself is inevitably contaminated and inferior in nutritional terms, in this case in comparison to 100% grass-fed and organic milk and dairy. America’s green-minded consumers understand that industrial agriculture poses a terminal threat to the environment and climate stability. A highly conscious and passionate segment of the population is beginning to understand that converting to non-chemical, non-genetically engineered, energy-efficient, carbon-sequestering organic/regenerative farming practices, and drastically reducing food miles by re-localizing the food chain, are essential preconditions for stabilizing our out-of-control climate and preparing our families and communities for future energy and resource shortages. A critical mass of the global grassroots—consumers, farmers, activists—now realize that unless we act quickly, global warming and climate chaos will soon severely disrupt industrial agriculture and long-distance food transportation, leading to massive crop failures, food shortages, famine, war, and pestilence. Even more alarming, accelerating levels of greenhouse gases will soon push global warming to a tipping point that will melt the polar icecaps and possibly unleash a cataclysmic discharge of climate-destabilizing methane, now sequestered in the fragile arctic tundra. Thanks to this growing consumer awareness—and four decades of hard work—the organic community has built up a 50-billion \\"certified organic\\" and 5-billion 100% grass-fed food and products sector that prohibits the use of genetic engineering and pesticides. The rapidly expanding organic products sector now constitutes more than 5 percent of total retail grocery sales (and 15 percent of fruits and vegetables), with an annual growth rate of 10-15 percent. Even taking into account a sluggish economy, the organic market, if we eliminate greenwashing and labeling fraud, could conceivably reach a “tipping point” of 20 percent of grocery sales in 2020. The myth of \\"natural\\" remains a threat As impressive as this 55 billion Organic and Grass-fed Alternative is, it remains overshadowed by an additional 90 billion in annual spending by consumers on products, such as B&J’s, fraudulently marketed as \\"natural,\\" “gmo-free,” “free range,” or “sustainable.” Consumer surveys indicate that the overwhelming majority of Americans believe that “natural” products are “almost organic,” yet at the same time, much cheaper; the majority believes that “all natural” actually means that it is better than organics. Ben & Jerry’s is not the only brand greenwashing its products and impeding the growth of organic, 100% grass-fed and regenerative foods. But it is certainly among the most shameless. In fact, all these \\"natural,\\" \\"all-natural\\" and \\"sustainable\\" products are neither backed up by rules and regulations, nor a third-party certifier. Most \\"natural\\" or conventional products—whether produce, dairy or canned or frozen goods—are produced on large industrial farms or in processing plants that are highly polluting, chemical-intensive and energy-intensive. Perhaps fraudulently labeled “natural” foods such as Ben & Jerry’s wouldn't matter so much if we were living in normal times, with a relatively healthy population, environment and climate. Conventional products sold as \\"natural\\" or \\"nearly organic\\" would be just one more example of chicanery or unethical business practices. But we are not living in normal times. Demanding that fake natural brands and producers, such as Ben & Jerry’s, make the transition to organic is a matter of life or death. We’re tired of pleading and politely asking Ben & Jerry’s, Unilever and other greenwashers to please change their ways. It’s time to step up the pressure. Please join the growing boycott of Ben & Jerry’s ice-cream by signing this petition and by volunteering to join a local campaign team in your local community. Ronnie Cummins is international director of the Organic Consumers Association. ||||| At Ben & Jerry's, we believe everyone should benefit from our ice cream, even the chickens. The eggs we buy for Ben & Jerry’s ice cream in the United States come from hens on Certified Humane cage-free farms. Certified Humane cage-free standards ensure that laying hens have wholesome, nutritious food, access to clean water, and adequate space to engage in normal behaviors, among other criteria crafted by veterinary professionals. ||||| A growing number of foods commonly found in kitchens across America have tested positive for glyphosate, the herbicide that is the main ingredient in the popular consumer pesticide Roundup, which is widely used in agriculture. But few brands on that list are as startling as the latest: Ben & Jerry’s, the Vermont ice cream company known for its family-friendly image and environmental advocacy. The Organic Consumers Association announced Tuesday that it found traces of glyphosate in 10 of 11 samples of the company’s ice creams — although at levels far below the ceiling set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Rob Michalak, global director of social mission at Ben & Jerry’s, said the company was working to ensure that all the ingredients in its supply chain come from sources that do not include genetically modified organisms, known as G.M.O.s. None of its plant-based ingredients, for instance, come from a genetically engineered crop like corn or soy, where glyphosate is used in production. The company is also trying to figure out a cost-effective way for the dairy farms that supply its milk to use non-G.M.O. feed. “We’re working to transition away from G.M.O., as far away as we can get,” Mr. Michalak said. “But then these tests come along, and we need to better understand where the glyphosate they’re finding is coming from. Maybe it’s from something that’s not even in our supply chain, and so we’re missing it.” ||||| Ben & Jerry's has always taken pains to be socially and environmentally responsible when sourcing ingredients. Back in 2005, we were the first ice cream maker in the world to use Fairtrade Certified ingredients. And in 2010, we decided to commit fully to the cause—across all our flavors and all the countries where our ice cream is sold. We made sure that every possible ingredient was Fairtrade Certified by 2011 in Europe, and did the same in the United States by 2014. The trend worldwide in agriculture is all about getting bigger, a lot bigger. Fair trade is important because it assures a fair price for small-scale farmers' products—in the face of growth that could easily push them out of the market. That's great news for them, their families and their communities. But it's also great for us (and for you), because we get to use their amazing ingredients in our ice cream. But there's more to the fair trade story. Linked prosperity, the idea that those who are successful should work to improve the world around them, is one of Ben & Jerry's founding principles. Fair trade puts this idea into action. All farmers in the Fairtrade system agree to use environmentally friendly farming practices, implement fair labor standards and invest in their communities. The Fairtrade social premium, an additional amount of money paid on top of the fair price that farmers receive, helps make those investments happen. ||||| There may be an ingredient found in weedkillers in your ice cream. Facebook/Ben & Jerry's Ben & Jerry's — a brand famous for its quality and eco-friendly practices — is under fire after a test uncovered a controversial ingredient in its ice cream. The Organic Consumers Association (OCA) found glyphosate, the main ingredient in weedkillers like Roundup, in 10 out of 11 samples of the company's ice cream flavors, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. While the levels of glyphosate were well below the legal limit set by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Organic Consumers Association argues that any presence of the pesticide product is misleading and potentially dangerous. \\"It's time for Ben & Jerry's to announce it will immediately begin transitioning to 100-percent organic,\\" using zero pesticides in production, the OCA said in a post on its website. \\"Otherwise conscious consumers have no choice but to launch a national and, if necessary, international protest campaign and boycott.\\" Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield Alberto Rodriguez / Getty The OCA has called for Ben & Jerry's to stop labeling its ice creams as \\"natural\\" because the brand's dairy cows consume genetically-engineered corn (the brand told the Times that it is working to find all-natural alternatives). Add-ins, such as peanut butter or cookie dough, containing ingredients that have been sprayed with the weedkiller may also be the source of the glyphosate in the ice creams, according to the Times. A Ben & Jerry's spokesperson said in a statement that the brand had not yet seen the results of the test, but could confirm that all ice cream flavors are safe to consume. \\"Even if the reported results are accurate, as the laboratory that conducted the test stated, a person would have to consume 145,000 eight-ounce servings PER DAY to reach the limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),\\" the spokesperson said. The question of if glyphosate is dangerous to consume is still hotly debated. While the World Health Organization said in 2015 that the weed killer was \\"probably carcinogenic,\\" Reuters reported in June that scientific data may not fully back that claim. Despite the continued debate, many customers simply do not want to have a herbicide ingredient in their food. Soon after the Times published its article on the OCA's ice cream test, the brand began receiving complaints and boycott threats on social media. \\"You are my favorite ice cream brand, but I CANNOT buy your ice cream again until it no longer comes up positive for MONSANTO'S GLYPHOSATE,\\" one person wrote on the brand's Facebook page, referring to Roundup's maker and leading G.M.O. seed producer, Monsanto. Ben & Jerry's, which was founded by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield (who the OCA calls \\"two affable hippies\\") in 1978, did not immediately return Business Insider's request for comment.
