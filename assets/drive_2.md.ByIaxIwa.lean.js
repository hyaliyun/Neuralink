After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\".

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.

I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want.

This event marked Estonia's first participation as an independent nation since its restoration of independence from the Soviet Union on August 20, 1991. Estonia's participation in the 1992 Winter Olympics holds historical significance as it demonstrated the nation's regained sovereignty and the ability to compete under its own flag. Estonia sent a team of 13 athletes to take part in various disciplines like Alpine Skiing, Biathlon, Cross-Country Skiing, Figure Skating, and Nordic Combined. However, despite their best efforts, Estonian athletes didn't manage to secure any medals at this particular edition of the Winter Olympics.

Context: Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" Question: When did Obama announce his donation for a summer jobs program?

Answer with \\"True\\" if the sentence belongs to that section, otherwise answer with \\"False\\" Input: Review: I still can't believe I dropped this much money on a duvet cover, it was more than the new down comforter we also bought! But I have to say, after just sitting it out in the (very elegant) packaging for about a week while convincing myself it was worth it I just could not bring myself to return it. So I finally unwrapped it and put it on the bed. It's sooooooo nice. The fabric is very nice quality and the print is crisp, deep, and a lot more intricate than a picture can show. The one we selected is all in rich tones of blue on a white background. Our bedroom is a pale yellow color and I wasn't sure I'd like such a strong, single tone like blue in a yellow room, but I do. I experimented with a couple different colored sets of bed linen and really like them all, especially a lighter yellow set and a stark white with some silvery gray accents. All the stitching is very well done and I have not found a single spot that needed attention. Each inside corner has ties that can be used on a comforter that has corresponding tabs, and the ties are just the right length to easily attach without struggling. It has a concealed button closure right at the edge and this makes both sides available to be face up. There were no odd smells when removing it from the packaging. I set it up right from the package, intending to only spread it out to look at then wash, but got lazy and just left it. The fabric is quite stiff with whatever product the manufacturer uses. While it means the cover is pretty much perfect right out of the box in appearances I don't like the stiffness, and it makes a rustling sound similar to waxed tissue paper when moving assertions at night. I plan to gently wash it soon and do not expect any issues from that. We ordered the king size and received king size pillow shams, which I wasn't expecting. It's fine, but we don't have that size pillows and honestly I don't plan to use them for sleeping anyway. I like the trim detail on the shams. Top use them you just insert the pillow through an opening in the center of the back. No buttons or need to fold fabric over anything. I'd also planned to buy a waterproof cover fire the duvet, mostly for the \\"dust\\" that down sometimes produces that escapes through fabric, but I don't think I need to with this set. The fabric of this cover is very, very dense and thick. I may still buy one since we have kids and pets, just to be safe. Dunno. So yeah, I do recommend this if you can accept the cost at first. I've never heard of this brand but I also don't buy linens or generally care about that kind of stuff. It came nicely packaged in a fancy cardboard box, wrapped in tissue paper, and neatly folded in a matching cloth bag with handles (that I plan to reuse to carry some files for a monthly meeting). I ordered some simple king sized pillows so I can go ahead and use the shams. I'd purchase this brand again but a seriously don't see this set ever wearing out or getting ratty.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes.

A shoot-out is usually considered for statistical purposes to be separate from the match which preceded it. In the case of a two-legged fixture, the two matches are still considered either as two draws or as one win and one loss; in the case of a single match, it is still considered as a draw.

Add spaces: 2.Usefewerwordsthataremoregeneric.","completion":"Here is the sentence with spaces added for better readability: 2. Use fewer words that are more generic. This statement suggests that when communicating or writing, it is better to opt for a concise approach by using fewer words to convey the same meaning. The idea is to select more general or all-encompassing terms instead of using an excessive number of specific or detailed words. Although every writing and communication style has its merit, using fewer words with more generic meanings can help make the message or information easier to understand. This is especially important when addressing a broader audience, as the diversity of the readers or listeners may lead to individual interpretations of the message. Using more generic words also helps in minimizing confusion and improving overall comprehension. It encourages the reader or listener to focus on the main point of the message, rather than getting lost in the intricate details and nuances of the words. Additionally, this method can save time and energy, both for the writer or speaker and the audience, since less time and effort are required in decoding complex information. To put this advice into practice, consider the following steps: 1. Analyze your message - Determine the main point and ensure that it is the focus of your communication. 2. Omit unnecessary words or phrases - Remove any words that don't contribute directly to the central idea or might even obstruct it. 3. Replace specific words with general terms - Consider using broader, more inclusive language that can effectively convey the message without relying on technical jargon or overly complex terminology. 4. Review and revise - After you have applied the suggestions above, read your message again to make sure that it is clear, concise, and understandable while still reflecting your intentions. Overall, using fewer words that are more generic can lead to more effective and efficient communication by simplifying the core message and making it more accessible to a wider audience. However, it is essential to strike the right balance between simplicity and clarity to avoid oversimplifying the information to the point where it loses its intended meaning or purpose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can also use a real hat for this method. Cut a 3 inches (76 mm) by 2 inches (51 mm) rectangle out of yellow construction paper or fabric. You should have a rectangular shape that looks like a window--a border with an empty space in the middle. This will be your buckle. Spread a layer of school glue or glue stick to the buckle. Sprinkle gold glitter on it, then let it dry. Be sure to shake off any excess glitter before using the buckle! Use the same kind of material you did for the buckle. The band should be about 2 inches (51 mm) wide, and it should be long enough to wrap completely around the base of the hat’s brim. Glue the buckle to the center of the band.

What do you do when you want to build up buzz for your startup without revealing an iota of what its purpose is? Name it after one of the most divisive memes on the Internet, of course: Hipster. So what is Hipster? We don’t know. The service is currently in stealth mode, the only info available being a “Coming Soon” page featuring a picture of your city and a call to sign up for more information. One is also asked to refer the service to three friends in order to gain swifter access. According to founder Doug Ludlow (who we wrote about four years ago for creating GroupMe predecessor Zemble), Hipster had been in a small closed alpha in Boulder, Colorado up until yesterday. (If you do a bit of digging on Hacker NewsHacker News you’ll see folks commenting on the alpha, which they liken to “Quora meets Foursquarefoursquare” — so there you go.) Ludlow wouldn’t tell us any more about the startup yet — he has applied to Jason Calacanis’s Launch Conference, and can’t say anything until he knows whether he’s made the cut. However, he has agreed to fill us in when he can, so stay tuned. Putting functionality aside for a moment, let’s focus on the name, which came to my attention after TechCrunch discoursed on the matter the other day. “Hipster” is an extremely controversial term in some respects (believe me, I’m supposed to be an expert on it, apparently) — as Ludlow says, “Some people hate the name, some people laugh when they hear it” — but it is also representative of a rather popular InternetInternet meme. Remember, we named “Hipsters” one of our favorite memes of 2010. And memes — of late — have spelled money for many companies. In recent months, we’ve seen several companies hitching their wagons to the meme/viral culture train — the Travelocity Gnome appeared on Chatroulette, as did that Last Exorcism chick, the Double Rainbow Guy shilled for Microsoft, and, most recently, golden-voiced homeless man Ted Williams was in a commercial for Kraft. “Hipsters,” for their part, have most notably shown up in a commercial for Honda. The adoption of the term by companies makes sense; “hipster,” as a word, has had a steadily growing presence on the web in the past year or so — take a look at Google Trends — and we’ve seen a proliferation of humor blogs, videos and parody songs bubbling across the web in the past 12 months as a result (still, the term seems to be plateauing of late, so Ludlow might want to speed up his reveal). For SEO’s sake alone, calling your service “Hipster” is a pretty shrewd move. Case in point, Ludlow says: “[Signups have] been insane over the last 15 hours. We’ve had close to 3,700 signups now. At the rate we’re going, we’re going to hit 10,000 by the end of the day.” While we can’t attribute the growing interest in the startup to the name alone, it’s safe to say it’s providing a goodly amount of the attention — given that no one knows what the startup is. So far, the divisive nature of the name seems to be doing well for Ludlow (aside from the few e-mails expressing broad disdain for hipster culture), but is the assignation of the term a wise choice in the long run when it comes to business? We asked a few experts for their input on this particular memefication: What’s in a name? Well, when you’re a business — everything. Yes, startups with admittedly silly names have more than succeeded (TwitterTwitter, anyone?), but naming your startup after a counterculture, or the meme that it has spawned, seems a little risky. To see how “Hipster” rates when it comes to staying power, MashableMashable turned to Nina Beckhardt, president of The Naming Group (an agency whose employees have crafted names for Walmart, Target and Puma). After being presented with the little information we have and the name itself, she told us that Ludlow is really going to have to amp up the humor of the term if he wants to succeed, playing off of the tongue-in-cheek quality of the word. “From what I can see in terms of their current pre-launch marketing tactics, this attention-grabbing, too cool for school (the categorical summation of most hipsters), just-you-wait-and-see type of witholding strategy, the name has real promise,” Beckhardt says. “That is a strategy that a hipster might choose.” Still, in order for the business to succeed, it has to offer more than the temporal popularity of the word, Beckhardt says. “The offering’s equity must hold strong and grow no matter how the definition morphs or how centrally or peripherally it remains in our lexicon over time. Again, it’s a bold move. The success of the name is ultimately dependent on execution and delivery of the offering.” As we mentioned before, the application of a meme to a marketing campaign is nothing new. Still, we began to wonder how successful these campaigns really were. David Berkowitz, senior director of emerging media and innovation at 360i, tells us that it’s a fine line when it comes to the marriage between marketing and memes. “A lot of marketers can get publicity, but it’s not always good publicity,” he says. “Then there’s the trick of capitalizing on it. Do people remember that Microsoft did the Double Rainbow spot, and then do they know what product Microsoft was promoting? (Answer: Windows Live, which I had to GoogleGoogle –- I didn’t even BingBing it.)” “For Hipster, I’m especially curious if the site is ultimately hip, ironic, snarky, Brooklyn-esque, or in any way remotely related to its name,” he adds. “Hipster will probably do well attracting signups, based on the buzz I’m seeing already. But without any context, who knows if any of these people signing up will actually care about the site once it launches.” So again, it all depends on how the product stacks up against the initial popularity of the meme. So how do the denizens of the counter culture feel about the whole thing? Will they embrace it in the same way many a hipster (and non-hipster) has embraced the similarly monikered Hipstamatic iPhone app? Well, it’s not like I can go downstairs to my local coffee shop and ask one of the “freelance graphic designers” looking at FacebookFacebook on their laptops (because no one would admit to being one), so instead I turned to Carles, founder of Hipster Runoff and the de facto father/mother(?) of the whole hipster blogging movement. (S/he also wrote a post on the service.) “There is no way that this web gimmick service can add any sort of value 2 any1′s life,” s/he tells us via e-mail. “After the success of the hit Mark Zuckerbro mockumentary ‘My Social Network–Plz friend me and Tag Me In Fotos,’ more people than ever are trying to start web startups that will not only make them rich, but also make them global icons. It seems as thought the era of ‘people starting buzzbands’ 2 be relevant, rich, & famous is over, and the era of ‘starting bloggable web startups’ has begun. I am positive that this CEO has visions of a ‘Groupon-like valuation,’ but it is more likely that this initial wave of blog coverage will be the only value that ‘Hipster.biz’ will be able to cultivate.” So that’s a “no,” then. Image courtesy of FlickrFlickr, Jack Newton What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The article discusses the implications of naming a start-up after an internet meme, using the example of Doug Ludlow’s business, Hipster, which is currently in stealth mode. Naming a start-up after a meme is a calculated move due to the pop culture status of memes. It is a strategy to build interest and intrigue about the company without revealing any specifics about the business. The name \\"Hipster\\" was chosen due to the term’s existing significance as a controversial and commonly used term within internet culture. Ludlow claims that the response to the name has been heavily divided, with some people laughing while others expressing vehement dislike. This divisive reaction, however, is thought to be contributing to the buzz surrounding the company. Ludlow reports the company has had a substantial wave of sign-ups. The article also emphasizes the role of memes in modern marketing. In recent times, multiple businesses have leveraged internet memes, viral images, videos, or phrases that people interact with and share, in their marketing campaigns. However, experts suggest that it's a risky line to tread. The key to success when it comes to naming a business after a meme, according to Nina Beckhardt, president of The Naming Group, and David Berkowitz, senior director of emerging media and innovation at 360i, is dependent on the actual offerings of the company, not just the initial popularity brought by the meme. The narrative presents the skepticism from different perspectives, including a comment by Carles, founder of Hipster Runoff, on the value and future prospects of such a start-up. He is doubtful of the long-term viability and significance of such a start-up, viewing it as an ephemeral wave that is currently in trend due to the popularity of web start-ups. The article raises a contemplative question on whether the association with a meme would be a wise business decision in the long run. However, with no clear answer, the growth and acceptance of the Hipster company remain to be seen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

FBI Agent Anna Gallagher is assigned to a series of mysterious threats that are targeting high-profile political figures. The threats seem to be coming from a ghost, leaving no traces behind. As the threats escalate to assassination attempts, Anna's superiors grow desperate to apprehend the mysterious assailant. As Anna digs deeper into the case, she stumbles upon an encrypted document with ties to a secret government project named \\"The Veil\\", which was disbanded several years ago. The project was aimed at creating the perfect assassin, using advanced psychological conditioning and mind-control techniques. Anna learns that Straker was one of the top operatives in the program, now seemingly turned against those who created him. Anna's investigation leads her to the small town where Straker is hiding. The two cross paths, and a cat-and-mouse game of wits begins. Straker attempts to shake her off his trail in a deadly game of deception and manipulation. However, Anna proves to be a formidable adversary and manages to uncover more about Straker's motives and the secrets he holds. As Anna gets closer to the truth, she discovers that Straker is not acting alone but is part of a larger conspiracy to expose and bring down corruption within the highest levels of government. She begins to question her own loyalties and the organization she works for. Meanwhile, Straker deals with a crisis of conscience. Having lived in the small town for years, he has built genuine relationships with the locals. As the FBI closes in, he's forced to confront the possibility of endangering the people with whom he has grown close. In a climactic final confrontation, Anna ultimately decides to team up with Straker, working together to bring the hidden corruption to light. Straker accepts the reality that he must face the consequences of his past actions, while Anna faces the realization that the institutions she trusted are not what they seem. As the credits roll, viewers are left with the lingering question of whether redemption and truth can really be achieved in a world of secrecy, deception, and well-guarded power structures. The future is uncertain for both Straker and Anna, but their actions have opened the door to change and the possibility of a new era."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But people who want to rise to the top should concentrate on looking healthy, according to a new study. Researchers found that 70 per cent of the time, a worker with a healthy complexion is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent. Researchers found that 70 per cent of the time, a worker with a healthy complexion (pictured right) is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent (bottom row). They came to their conclusion after conducting an experiment where participants chose from different faces (shown) to pick the leader of a fictional company. They discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘optional extra’ for workers looking for a pay rise or for politicians seeking election. In an experiment by VU University Amsterdam, 148 candidates were asked to select a future leader of a fictional firm by choosing between two digitally manipulated photographs of the same man. One image was altered to make him look healthier and the other manipulated to make him look cleverer. The experiment revealed that seven times out of 10, the man with the healthy complexion was more appealing than the intelligent looking male. ‘Here we show that it always pays for aspiring leaders to look healthy, which explains why politicians and executives often put great effort, time, and money in their appearance,’ said Assistant Professor Brian Spisak from the Department of Management and Organisation at the university. The experts discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘optional extra’ for workers looking for a raise (illustrated with a stock image) or for politicians looking to get elected. However, people are more likely to vote for a healthy-looking politician and choose a healthy-looking boss. Office plants help workers be more creative and productive, which could result in promotion, a University of Exeter study claims. At work, humble houseplants have been proven to aid concentration, increase productivity and boost staff wellbeing by 47 per cent, according to a study undertaken in December last year. The results showed that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent. Plants have previously been proven to have positive effects in hospitals, where patients with potted plants close by said they experienced less pain, anxiety and tiredness, while houses with plant-filled rooms contain between 50 and 60 per cent fewer bacteria than other rooms without plants. ‘If you want to be chosen for a leadership position, looking intelligent is an optional extra under context-specific situations whereas the appearance of health appears to be important in a more context-general way across a variety of situations.’ In the experiment, the participants were given a job description that specified the CEO’s main challenge each time they were asked to choose between the two images. Job descriptions involved driving aggressive competition, renegotiating a key partnership with another company, leading the company’s shift into a new market and overseeing the sustained exploitation of non-renewable energy. The participants chose more healthy-looking faces over less healthy-looking faces in 69 per cent of trials and this preference was equally strong irrespective of the future CEO’s main challenge, according to the study published in the access journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. More intelligent-looking faces were only preferred over less intelligent-looking faces for the two challenges that would require the most diplomacy and inventiveness: renegotiating the partnership and exploring the new market. The aim of the experiment was to explore people’s implicit preferences for traits of leaders, such as health, intelligence, and attractiveness. The researchers focused on facial traits because these provide a wealth of information about individuals. In women as well as men, caring and cooperative personalities are statistically more likely to have a more ‘feminine’ face, due to higher oestrogen levels, while aggressive risk-takers tend to have higher testosterone levels and a more ‘masculine’ face.

SEOUL — North Korea’s sudden threat to pull out of the upcoming summit with the U.S. raises new doubts of whether a denuclearization deal is possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

Suddenly, his reflection cuts its throat with a mirror shard, killing the \\"real\\" security guard. Ben Carson (Kiefer Sutherland), a suspended police detective, begins his first day as a night security guard at the Mayflower, a luxury department store that was gutted by a fire and shuttered five years prior.

News article: CDC says 6 confirmed and probable cases of Zika sexual transmission The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday reported six confirmed and probable cases of sexual transmission of the mosquito-borne Zika virus from male travelers to female non-travelers. The findings suggest that sexual transmission of the virus might be more common than previously reported, the CDC said. U.S. health officials on Tuesday said it was investigating 14 reports of the Zika virus that may have been transmitted through sex, including to several pregnant women. In two of the suspected cases, the infection had been confirmed in women whose only known risk factor was sexual contact with an infected male partner who had recently traveled to an area with active Zika transmission through mosquito bites, the CDC said on Tuesday. The agency said on Friday that of the nine cases of U.S. pregnant travelers infected with Zika, one delivered a child with birth defects. Pregnancy outcomes among the nine confirmed cases included two early pregnancy losses, two elective terminations, and three live births.

The most important nautical innovation of the Song period seems to have been the introduction of the magnetic mariner's compass, which permitted accurate navigation on the open sea regardless of the weather. The magnetized compass needle – known in Chinese as the \\"south-pointing needle\\" – was first described by Shen Kuo in his 1088 Dream Pool Essays and first mentioned in active use by sailors in Zhu Yu's 1119 Pingzhou Table Talks. There were other considerable advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty. The 10th-century invention of the pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal, which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges. There was the Song-era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships. If ships were damaged, the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water. The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal-like structure. Stern-mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century, as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship. In the Song period, the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths. The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction. David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement \\"[made] them more reliable\\" for anchoring ships.","completion":"Shen Kuo wrote about the first use of the magnetized compass needle in his 1088 Dream Pool Essays."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a standard game of chess, how many queens does each player start with????","completion":"In a standard game of chess, each player begins with one queen. The chessboard is an 8x8 grid, with 64 squares in total, and each player has a total of 16 pieces at the beginning of the game. These pieces include one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The pieces are set up in two rows, with the pawns in the second row and the more powerful pieces in the first row. The queen is considered the most powerful piece on the chessboard, with the ability to move vertically, horizontally, and diagonally for any number of unoccupied squares. In other words, the queen can move like a rook or a bishop, combining their abilities. This flexibility allows the queen to control vast areas of the board and threaten multiple pieces simultaneously. The starting position of the queen is determined by her color. For the white pieces, the queen begins on the d1 square (the fourth square from the left on the first row), while for the black pieces, the queen starts on the d8 square (the fourth square from the left on the eighth row). The queen is positioned next to the king, and an easy way to remember her starting position is by recalling the phrase, \\"queen on her color\\" - meaning the white queen is on a white square, and the black queen is on a black square. During the course of a game, it is possible for either player to have more than one queen. This can be achieved through a process called pawn promotion. If a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board (the eighth rank for a white pawn or the first rank for a black pawn), the player has the option to promote the pawn to any other piece of their choosing (except for a king). Oftentimes, players choose to promote their pawn to a queen, as it is the most powerful piece. This can result in a scenario where a player has multiple queens on the board, further increasing their attacking capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The number of Scottish boats carrying cameras - which monitor the fish being caught - has halved since the scheme was introduced. New species were added to the ban at the start of January. They include North Sea cod and whiting, which can no longer be thrown back into the sea. Fishermen have traditionally discarded unwanted fish because they carry a lower financial value but, if landed, would count against their quotas. The environmental group says the fall in Remote Electronic Monitoring compromises stock management. Figures from the Scottish government show there are now just 15 boats carrying cameras. When the scheme was first introduced in 2014, there were 32. Until this year, skippers were allowed an additional quota for North Sea cod if they agreed to install the camera equipment, but that incentive has ended. The ban on discards is covered by Landing Obligations which are being phased in over a number of years. They identify which species have to be brought ashore once they are caught. Helen McLachlan, the fisheries governance programme manager at WWF Scotland, said: \\"WWF is supportive of the Landing Obligation because, if implemented, effectively it offers clear opportunities, the most obvious of which is healthier fish stocks and a more resilient, profitable industry as a result. \\"However, with North Sea cod and whiting coming under the discard ban at the start of 2017, we have significant concerns about the levels of monitoring and control of the ban. \\"For this policy to work we need to be confident we know what is happening at sea and how much fish is being removed. Yet, on average, it appears that less than one per cent of fishing trips are being monitored.\\" The fishing industry has been opposed to the \\"inflexible\\" way in which the discard ban has been implemented under the Common Fisheries Policy. They say the regulations are the problem rather than monitoring. Bertie Armstron, chief executive of the Scottish Fisherermen's Federation, said: \\"Everybody's on the same side with reducing discards as far as physically possible. It's just a question of getting the rules right, which is a work in progress. \\"Cameras, frankly, are a little sideshow and the presence or absence of them will not solve or fail to solve the problem.\\" Quota incentives for other species still exist under the scheme, even though the incentive for North Sea cod has ended. By 2019, the disposal of all fish at sea will be banned. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \\"No-one wants to see dead fish being thrown back into the sea - least of all our fishermen. \\"Our fleet has already made good progress to reduce the level of discarded fish in Scotland and we are working hard to ensure the ban is implemented in a pragmatic, proportionate and phased way. \\"If managed sensibly, the landing obligation will be good for Scotland and help the conservation of fish stocks that offer up dependable and sustainable catches for fishermen.\\"","completion":"The number of fishing boats in Scotland that have cameras to monitor fish being caught has reduced by half since the introduction of the scheme in 2014, leading to concerns over proper management of fish stocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jean Marc Gaspard Itard A:","completion":"Title: Whispering Wilderness Synopsis: Set in early 19th century France, Whispering Wilderness is an emotive historical drama centered around the lives of Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, a passionate and innovative young physician with a background in education for the deaf, and Victor, a feral child found living in the wild. Act I: In 1800, a group of hunters chance upon Victor, a young boy believed to be 12 years old, roaming the dense Aveyron forests in the south of France. He is unable to speak and apparently displays savage, animalistic behaviors. The authorities capture the \\"wild child\\" and bring him to Paris, where he becomes the talk of the city. As debates over nature versus nurture heat up among scholars and the public alike, the government assigns Victor's guardianship to Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, an innovative young physician with expertise in education for the hearing-impaired. Act II: Itard takes Victor to his home and begins the monumental task of 'taming' and educating the feral boy. At first, progress is slow. The wild child's distaste for captivity is apparent, and he frequently breaks out to roam the streets of Paris, only to be retrieved by a determined Itard. Itard introduces different techniques and methods involving patience, persistence, and intricate visual aids. Gradually, the teacher and student develop a bond, and Victor starts to show progress. Under Itard's guidance, he learns to recognize tactile symbols associated with various objects, responds to his own name, begins showing empathy, and manages to acquire basic social skills. Act III: While Itard's work with Victor proves controversial among the high society, some start to question the efficacy of traditional education systems. The scientific community is torn, with some lauding Itard's rehabilitation efforts as revolutionary and others condemning his \\"tampering with nature.\\" Itard becomes increasingly obsessed with teaching Victor to speak, believing it is the key to his full integration into society and a manifestation of his ultimate intelligence. Act IV: Despite Victor's significant improvement in understanding and various skills, his ability to speak remains limited. Itard is disheartened, but the pair's profound connection endures.

Step 2: Analyze possible feelings Bailey might feel refreshed after riding the bike home and feel engaged while chatting with friends. Social interaction often provides mental stimulation and enjoyment. Step 3: Evaluate the validity of \\"bored\\" Given the circumstances (physical activity and social interaction), it's less likely that Bailey would feel bored afterward.

After purchasing I found this mainly to be what I consider common sense retail concepts. Overall I was disappointed with the content. Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The reviewer seems to have had high expectations for the book \\"The Profitable Retailer\\" based on the positive reviews they had read prior to their purchase. However, upon reading the book, they found it to be lacking in terms of providing insightful information. Instead, they felt that the content mainly covered what they consider to be \\"common sense retail concepts.\\" Their overall disappointment with the book's content is a clear indication of a negative stance towards the product. Several factors contribute to the negative tone of this review: 1. Unmet Expectations: The reviewer's disappointment stems from the initial expectations they had for the book, perhaps led by previous positive reviews they encountered. When a product does not meet or surpass its expectations, it is usual for the consumer to express dissatisfaction, contributing to a negative tone in their review. 2. Lack of Insightful Information: The reviewer mentions that they were anticipating more insightful content from the book. In this context, the absence of valuable information not only leads to dissatisfaction but also conveys the reviewer's disappointment in the lack of novelty or uniqueness of the book's content, representing a negative perspective on the product. 3. Coverage of Common Sense Concepts: The reviewer suggests that the book's main content could be easily classified as common sense in the retail industry. This sentiment further emphasizes their disappointment, as they possibly expected the book to provide new information that might be unknown to them or require more profound analysis and understanding. 4. Overall Disappointment: The review ends with the statement that the reviewer was disappointed with the content. This conclusive remark sets a strongly negative tone for the review, as the reviewer is left underwhelmed by the product despite their initial interest based on other reviews. In summary, the negative tone of this product review arises from the reviewer's unmet expectations, lack of insightful information, coverage of common sense retail concepts, and overall disappointment in the book \\"The Profitable Retailer.\\" These elements collectively contribute to conveying a negative perception of the product under review."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. For every four inches (10cm) above five feet a person was, the researchers said they had a 16% increased cancer risk. The study of more than one million women, published in The Lancet Oncology, suggested chemicals that control growth might also affect tumours. Cancer Research UK said tall people should not be alarmed by the findings. The study followed 1.3 million middle-aged women in the UK between 1996 and 2001. It linked 10 cancers to height - colon, rectal, malignant melanoma, breast, endometrial (uterus), ovarian, kidney, lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukaemia. Those in the tallest group, over 5ft 9in, were 37% more likely to have developed a tumour than those in the shortest group, under 5ft. Although the study looked only at women, the researchers said the height link was also present in men. They combined 10 other research studies which showed a similar link in men. Dr Jane Green, lead researcher and from the University of Oxford, told the BBC: \\"Obviously height itself cannot affect cancer, but it may be a marker for something else.\\" By James Gallagher, Health reporter. Overweight patients may have been told to lose a few inches for the good of their health in the past - this time there's nothing anyone can do about it. Height, however, is not a universally bad thing. It is believed people are becoming taller due to better nutrition and fewer diseases in childhood. Being tall has also been linked to reduced rates of heart disease. It is also not the biggest contributor to cancer. A height link was greatly reduced or eliminated for some cancers in smokers - researchers said the effect of height had been \\"swamped\\". Obesity is also a big factor, a 10 point increase in Body Mass Index increases the risk of breast cancer by around 40%. Height might one day help doctors screen for cancer risk and it is hoped, that by furthering the understanding of cancers, the study will help researchers discover treatments. Scientists believe that as there is a link across many cancers there \\"may be a basic common mechanism\\". They think, but have not proved, that growth hormones - such as insulin-like growth factors - may be the explanation. Higher levels of growth factors could do two things. They could result in more cells - taller people are made of more stuff so there are more cells which could mutate and become tumours. Alternatively, they could increase the rate of cell division and turnover, increasing the risk of cancer. But as Dr Green admitted: \\"The point is we don't know.\\" Cancer Research UK's Sara Hiom said: \\"Tall people need not be alarmed by these results. Most people are not a lot taller, or shorter, than average, and their height will only have a small effect on their individual cancer risk.\\" Dr Caitlin Palframan, policy manager at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: \\"The big question is why this connection exists. If we can unravel why height affects the risk of cancer it will lead us closer to understanding how some cancers develop.\\" The researchers suggested that height could also have contributed to increasing cancer incidence. In Europe, average height is thought to have increased by around 1cm every decade during the 20th Century. They argued that the height increase in that time could have resulted in a 10-15% more cancers than if heights had remained the same.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, let's take a step-by-step approach to analyze and understand the motivations behind patriotism and the slight differences between the questions. 1. Define patriotism: Patriotism is a strong emotional attachment to one's country and its values. It often involves a sense of pride, loyalty, and deep love towards the nation. 2. Identify common reasons for patriotism: People may be patriotic due to a variety of factors such as cultural connections, shared historical experiences, social belonging, and personal upbringing. Patriotism can also be promoted by national symbols, anthems, and rituals that create a sense of unity among individuals. 3. Compare the questions: The first question is asking about the reasons behind some people's patriotism, while the second question is emphasizing the intensity of patriotism in people. Both questions are related, but they approach patriotism from different angles. 4. Are the questions the same? Not entirely. While both questions are asking about the reasons for patriotism, the first question is more focused on why some individuals exhibit patriotic feelings, while the second question is asking why people express strong levels of patriotism. The essence of both questions is similar, but they highlight different aspects of the same topic. In conclusion, while both questions relate to the concept of patriotism, they are not entirely the same as they emphasize different aspects of it. People may be patriotic for various reasons such as shared cultural bonds, historical experiences, social connections, and personal upbringing. The intensity of patriotism varies among individuals and is influenced by the factors that contribute to their attachment to their country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In 1767, the whole of Malabar again revolted Mysore's army of 4,000 men, who were defeated by 2,000 Kottayam Nairs in Northern Malabar. All baggage, arms and ammunition of army was looted by the Nair rebels. Mysorean garrisons were trapped by Nair rebels who seized the countryside and ambushed Mysore convoys and communications with great success. The following year, the English East India Company, under Captain Thomas Henry, sieged the Sultan Bathery Fort to interrupt the supply of arms to Arakkal Kingdom, with a promised help from local kingdoms. But the British were forced to retreat in the retaliation. Mysore army retreated from Malabar temporarily in 1768, successfully crushing the uprisings and building the strategic Palakkad Fort. The authority over Kolathunad was now given to the Arakkal Kingdom. Skirmishes between Arakkal and the Company continued, and in 1770, the Company reclaimed Randattara. In 1773, Mysore forces under Said Saheb and Srinivasarao marched to Malabar through the Thamarassery Pass, since the Hindu rulers had broke the earlier treaties on paying tributes. So, again in the Malabar came under the direct Mysore authority.

The sentence states: \\"The clock of Benjamin was more antique than the clock of Randy because\\" Here, it is mentioned that Benjamin's clock is older compared to Randy's clock. Based on the information provided, we can use the following reasoning: Step 1: Examine both possible answer choices. [1] Benjamin's clock was passed down through the family. [2] Randy's clock was passed down through the family. Step 2: Determine how each answer choice relates to the sentence. Answer [1] would imply that Benjamin's clock is older because it was handed down through the family, which suggests a longer history. Answer [2] states that Randy's clock was passed down through the family, but this doesn't explain why Benjamin's clock would be more antique. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer based on the reasoning. Since answer [1] provides a logical explanation for why Benjamin's clock would be more antique, we'll choose this option.

Ben Richards (Ayres) of the Air Force Space Command insists that Dan is their best pilot, even though when piloting the Y-12 into the ionosphere, he began experiencing flight difficulties. Upon landing, Dan broke flight regulations by going to see his girlfriend (Landi), rather than immediately filing his flight report. Despite these concerns, Capt. Richards insists that Dan pilot the Y-13 after a thorough check-out and briefing by Dr. Paul von Essen ([Jaffe). The Y-13 takes off, and at 600,000 feet, Dan is supposed to level off and begin his descent. But he continues to climb, firing his rocket emergency boost for more speed. He climbs to 1,320,000 feet (250 miles) and suddenly loses control of the Y-13 while passing through a dense cloud of unknown material, which forces him to eject. The New Mexico State Police later send a report that a Mexican farmer spotted a parachute, attached to some sort of aircraft, land near his farm, 10 miles south of Alvarado, New Mexico. Chief Wilson (Bill Nagy) meets with Cmdr. Prescott, showing him the wreckage. Tests later show that the automatic escape mechanism and braking chute operated perfectly.

I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new.

Firstly, the customer mentions they had an \\"awful experience.\\" This negative sentiment is further emphasized by specific details mentioned in their review: 1. The owner charged a higher price (216) than the original quote (176) given by an employee, indicating poor communication within the company and possibly deceitful practices towards customers. 2. The owner's perceived lack of respect and dismissive attitude towards the customer's concern about the price difference, as well as his unwillingness to honor the initial quote. 3. The offensive language (\\"Jew Bastard\\") the owner used when addressing the customer, which showcases unprofessionalism and is unacceptable in any business setting. 4. The customer's strong recommendation against using this company, which serves as a clear indication of their dissatisfaction and negative experience.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Flying for the holidays? Frequent fliers have some tips By Gary Stoller, USA TODAY To avoid congested roads and crowded airports, frequent traveler Rip Russell will fly home on Thanksgiving morning and fly back to his job in Russell, a production accountant working on a movie, says flying on those days to and from Atlanta shortens his holiday but reduces stress. \\"By traveling on the shoulders of these megapeak days, I'm far less likely to arrive stressed from the in-bound trip and the anticipation of the dreaded Sunday-after airport pressure cooker,\\" Russell says. About 24 million air travelers — nearly 4% more than last year — are expected to fly on U.S. airlines during the Thanksgiving holiday, estimates the Air Transport Association, which represents the carriers. Many travelers will be amateurs by the standards of Russell and other frequent fliers. They'll not have flown since this time last year or maybe two or three years ago, when planes and airports weren't as crowded as they'll be this month or next for the Christmas holiday. They lack the strategies that people who put in 50, 100 or more days on the road each year use to avoid hassles and stay cool, calm and collected while trying to get to their destinations. For those infrequent travelers, Russell and other frequent fliers from USA TODAY's panel of Road Warriors, who log millions of miles a year in the sky, offer some tips to ensure holidays aren't spoiled by the rigors of travel. Russell, for instance, suggests avoiding connecting flights on small regional jets in addition to avoiding peak travel days. Instead, he says, he drives the 2½ hours from Atlanta to his cabin in Waynesville, N.C. \\"I avoid the overpriced and cramped regional jet experience,\\" Russell says. \\"The cost savings is significant, and there are fewer headaches and opportunities for flight-related delays or lost luggage.\\" •Jeff Jones, a manager for a food industry manufacturer, says he books an early-morning flight, because airport traffic is lighter, and he has more flight options if his morning flight is canceled or delayed. He also checks in ahead of time online to avoid a wait at the airline counter. \\"I always allow more time for everything,\\" says Jones of Madison, Wis. \\"I double the amount of time I usually plan for getting through security.\\" •Christian Johnson, a vice president for a gaming company, says he books only non-stop flights. \\"Connections domestically are very difficult and unpredictable in the best of times,\\" says Johnson of Las Vegas. \\"During holidays, it's a crapshoot.\\" •Tony Goddard, COO of a company in West Seneca, N.Y., that manufactures equipment for the aviation industry, recommends that fliers without elite frequent-flier program privileges book higher-priced tickets. \\"If a flight is oversold or canceled, and you are fighting for a seat on the next available flight, a higher fare will put you much higher up on a standby list,\\" Goddard says. •Bob Bender, an architect in Lenexa, Kan., says holiday travelers should pack light but make sure necessary items such as prescription medicine and phone numbers are available if a flight is delayed. Bender and other frequent fliers advise travelers to not carry Christmas presents through security but instead ship them or put them in checked bags. Security screeners at passenger checkpoints \\"like boxes that are wrapped,\\" Bender says. Maybe the most important advice, some veteran travelers say, is to be at ease and have a positive mind-set when navigating through even the most crowded of airports, such as Atlanta's Hartsfield or Chicago's O'Hare, the nation's two busiest, respectively. \\"Relax and give yourself time to take in the displays that most large airports have available,\\" Bender says. \\"Atlanta has a great display of African art in the tunnel under the concourses. Chicago has the airplane flown by Lt. Cmdr. Edward O'Hare. And Denver has a great art display on the bridge between the main terminal and Concourse A.\\" Kevin Korterud, a consultant in New Albany, Ohio, says he enjoys flying just before Thanksgiving. \\"I feel a collective experience with so many people headed to destinations anticipating happy times,\\" he says. Korterud says he goes out of his way to help military personnel flying home. Several times, he has given them, \\"as a sign of appreciation,\\" his first-class seat or made them guests at an airline club, he says. Korterud, who travels on business four days a week, says it \\"may sound corny,\\" but he tries \\"to embrace the holidays\\" when traveling. \\"Put some old Christmas music on the iPod and look for large holiday lighting displays when flying at night,\\" he says. \\"Think about all of the people who are not able to travel before the holidays, especially those who are not with us.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who could not see Ninnis? On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

Answer:","completion":"The name of the person who could not see Ninnis is Mertz."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the last name of the person whose baton Monteux studied under? Answer the above question based on the context below: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.

Erin, on the other hand, was fluent in English even though it wasn't her native language. Over time, Erin had invested significant time and effort to learn English, attending classes, and practicing with native speakers in order to become proficient. The child, being a native English speaker, found it easier and more comfortable to converse with Erin as they were able to communicate effortlessly and understand each other perfectly. On the contrary, Tanya, despite her warm and friendly nature, faced linguistic challenges that made it difficult for her to communicate with the child. She had only started learning English a few months ago and hadn't yet achieved a level of fluency to engage in a meaningful conversation. The language barrier between Tanya and the child made it almost impossible for them to connect and share their thoughts, feelings, and ideas with each other. The child, being relatively young, hadn't yet developed the necessary patience and understanding to facilitate communication with someone who didn't speak their language proficiently. As kids often prefer engaging with others who can easily understand them and respond, the child felt more at ease while talking to Erin. This natural tendency played a significant role in their decision to engage more with Erin than with Tanya. It was quite apparent that Tanya wanted to engage with the child as well; she often tried to learn new words and phrases in order to be a part of their conversations. However, her limited vocabulary, coupled with her struggle to comprehend and construct sentences with appropriate grammar, prevented her from participating in deeper conversations. As a result, the child felt inclined to stick to communicating with Erin, who could easily grasp and participate in discussions without needing any additional assistance. This situation, however, also provided an invaluable learning opportunity for Tanya. Her interaction with the child motivated her to enroll in more advanced English courses and actively seek out conversation partners to improve her language skills. Over time, she became more fluent in English and eventually managed to bridge the communication gap that once existed between her and the child. In conclusion, the child talked to Erin but not to Tanya because Tanya didn't speak English very well, making communication difficult. This language barrier deterred the child from engaging with Tanya, while Erin's fluency in English contributed to a smoother and more natural interaction. While the situation might seem unfavorable at first, it eventually became a means for Tanya to further her language-learning journey and effectively enhance her communication skills."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, they are not identical due to a few differences which can be noted. First, the subject in the two statements is not the same. In the first sentence, the subject is vague and generalized as 'someone', which doesn't specify who is performing the action. On the other hand, the second sentence precisely identifies the subject as 'the man'. Secondly, their tense is also different. The first sentence is in the present tense, depicting a current action, whereas the second sentence is in the past tense, referring to an action that has already occurred. The type of oil mentioned also varies. The first sentence explicitly mentions 'olive oil' while the second sentence is generic, simply referring to 'oil' without specifying what type which leaves it open-ended. The form of tomato is slightly different as well. 'Tomato wedges' in the first sentence suggest tomatoes cut into thick slices or quarters, while 'tomato slices' in the second sentence could refer to thinner pieces. Despite these differences, both sentences essentially refer to the same basic action, which is the act of pouring oil onto tomatoes. Given these factors, on the scale of 0 - 5, where 0 is \\"not similar at all\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as +3. This indicates that while there are notable differences, the two sentences do not digress significantly from each other in terms of underlying meaning. They share a common theme of the act of oil being poured on tomatoes, although the subject, tense, type of oil, and form of tomatoes are different. Thus, the rating of +3 accounts for the fundamental similarities while considering the evident disparities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"A website that accused Google of abusing its position in the search market by \\"driving traffic\\" to Google Maps has lost its High Court action.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: High Court Rejects Website's Allegation Against Google for Search Market Abuse The High Court has delivered judgment in favor of tech giant Google in a recent lawsuit, where it was accused of abusing its monopolistic dominance in the search market to allegedly steer traffic towards its in-house application, Google Maps. The website that levelled the allegations, whose identity is kept confidential for legal reasons, has seen its case dismissed. The website took the tech giant to court over claims that Google intentionally manipulated its search engine results to favor its own product, Google Maps, over competitor services. The plaintiff claimed this behavior led to a significant and artificial enhancement of Google's online map service's visibility and user-base at the expense of other market players. However, following an intense legal battle, these allegations did not hold up to the scrutiny of the court. The major point of contention in this case was centred around the assertion that Google was misusing its overwhelming influence in the digital search marketplace. With more than 92% of global search engine market share, the company's position gives it significant sway over which products and services gain online visibility. The plaintiff asserted this influence was being unfairly wielded to drive increased traffic to Google Maps, thereby disadvantaging other online mapping services. Google, on the other hand, steadfastly refuted these claims. The tech leviathan defended its practices, pointing out that its algorithms are designed to offer users the best and most relevant search results. This includes prioritizing Google Maps, which is undeniably a popular and widely-used service, often perceived as more accurate and user-friendly than many of its direct competitors. The defense further underlined that the algorithms consider multiple variables including relevance, usability, and user satisfaction. Thus, the purported higher traffic towards Google Maps, they argued, was an earned outcome of the service's superior attributes rather than a result of undue preferential treatment. After a thorough examination of the evidence, the High Court was not swayed by the website’s argument. The court ruling acknowledged Google’s right to improve its own services and noted the lack of concrete evidence to prove the plaintiff's claims of Google biasing search results. The High Court’s ruling is a resolute endorsement of Google's business practices and a rebuff to accusations of its alleged abuse of power in the search market. The dismissal of the lawsuit reaffirms that, while Google is undeniably a dominant player in the search engine market space, the quality and relevance of its services are significant contributing factors to its leading position. However, this court decision is unlikely to quieten the ongoing debates about the potential exploitation of dominant market positions by big tech companies. Questions of market fairness, consumer choice, and the balancing act between fostering innovation and preventing domination will continue to shape future discussions and potential litigations. While the High Court's ruling stands as a notable milestone in favor of Google, it does underline the necessity for clear and comprehensible regulations in this digital era, forming an intersection between user-centric service, fair business practice, and the immense influence of tech giants. These are issues that will continue to occupy legislators, regulators, and industry players in the years to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert Gordon Orr, OC (born March 20, 1948) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest hockey players of all time. Orr used his ice skating speed, scoring, and play-making abilities to revolutionize the position of defenceman. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for 12 seasons, starting with 10 with the Boston Bruins followed by two with the Chicago Black Hawks. Orr remains the only defenceman to have won the league scoring title with two Art Ross Trophies. By the time Orr turned 16 in 1964, he was still two years away from playing in the NHL and his father Doug was dissatisfied with the Bruins' treatment of the prospect. Doug had asked the Bruins' Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help out with the situation. Eagleson agreed to work with the family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers. The two soon became a team, discussing Bobby's future plans without his father Doug. Eagleson was determined to get Orr a top salary. When Hap Emms, the general manager of the Bruins offered a US5,000 (US37,713 in 2017 dollars) signing bonus and US7,000 and US8,000 (US52,798 and US58,715 in 2017 dollars) for his first two years in the league, Eagleson countered with US100,000 (US754,256 in 2017 dollars) for the two years. or Orr would refuse to play with the Bruins and play for Canada's national team instead, like Carl Brewer. Orr wanted desperately to play in the NHL, but he went along with Eagleson's strategy and was willing to play for the nationals. The Bruins and Orr agreed on a US25,000 signing bonus (US188,564 in 2017 dollars), and a salary \\"less than 100,000\\" for the two years, a figure kept secret. Speculation has ranged on an annual salary of US25,000 to US40,000 (US188,564 to US339,415 in 2017 dollars) at a time when the typical maximum rookie salary was US8,000. (US60,341 in 2017 dollars) The official signing ceremony was done on Emms' boat, the Barbara Lynn, where Eagleson and Emms had conferred during negotiations. At the time, it made Orr the highest-paid player in league history. But beyond that, the signing became one of the most important in the history of professional hockey. Until that time, players had been forced to accept whatever NHL management paid in salaries. It was the start of the player's agent era in professional hockey. For Eagleson, it was the start of his sports business empire. Based on the Orr signing, Eagleson would become the executive director of the new National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and started on his rise to become one of the most powerful men in the sport and business of ice hockey. Orr joined the Bruins for the 1966-67 season, his first as a professional. The Bruins were not convinced Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. At the season's start, the Bruins offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, but Orr chose jersey number 4. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, getting one assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was a slap shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a standing ovation. In that first season, Orr was challenged by the veterans, and he earned respect by defeating Montreal tough guy Ted Harris in his first NHL fight. On December 4, 1966, Toronto Maple Leafs' defenceman Marcel Pronovost checked him into the boards, injuring Orr's knees for the first time in the NHL. He would miss nine games and the Bruins would lose six of them. The team finished with a 17-43-10 record, leaving the Bruins in last place. However, attendance at Boston Garden increased by forty-one thousand fans. For the season, Orr scored 13 goals and 28 assists, one of the best rookie seasons in NHL history to that point by a defenceman. Orr won the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league's outstanding rookie and was named to the NHL's Second All-Star team. New York Rangers defenceman Harry Howell won the Norris Trophy as the league's best defenceman that year. In accepting the award, Howell said he was glad to win when he did, predicting \\"Orr will own this trophy from now on.\\" Orr was runner-up in voting. In 1969-70, Orr almost doubled his scoring total from the previous season, to 120 points, six shy of the league record (which had been set by his teammate Phil Esposito the previous season), leading the league in scoring. As of 2016, Orr is the only defenceman in history to win the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer, which he also achieved a second time, in 1974-75. In addition to the Norris and the Art Ross, Orr captured the first of three consecutive Hart Trophies as regular-season MVP and later won the Conn Smythe Trophy for his playoff performance, becoming the only player in history to win four major NHL awards in one season. Orr went on to lead the Bruins in a march through the 1970 playoffs scoring nine goals and 11 assists. The march culminated on May 10, 1970, when he scored one of the most famous goals in hockey history and one that gave Boston its first Stanley Cup since 1941. The goal came off a give-and-go pass with teammate Derek Sanderson at the 40-second mark of the first overtime period in the fourth game, helping to complete a sweep of the St. Louis Blues. According to Orr: If it had gone by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really trying to get the puck on net, and I did. As I went across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped. The subsequent photograph by Ray Lussier of a horizontal Orr flying through the air, his arms raised in victory - he had been tripped by Blues' defenceman Noel Picard after scoring the goal - has become one of the most famous and recognized hockey images of all time--and today is highlighted in the opening sequence of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Hockey Night in Canada telecasts. Did he get a large salary?","completion":"Yes, Bobby Orr received a large salary. According to the article, \\"The Bruins and Orr agreed on a US25,000 signing bonus (US188,564 in 2017 dollars), and a salary 'less than 100,000' for the two years, a figure kept secret.

A:","completion":"Before Remy is ready to take the walk on the trail and gallop off on their horse, they need to do the following steps: 1. Choose the right horse: Remy must first select a suitable horse that matches their riding ability, experience level, and that is physically capable of undertaking the trail. 2. Check equipment: Remy should inspect their tack (saddle, bridle, reins, etc.) to ensure that everything is in good condition and fits their horse properly. This will help prevent discomfort for both Remy and the horse during the ride. 3. Groom the horse: Grooming the horse is essential to maintaining its health and well-being. Remy should clean the horse's coat, mane, and tail, as well as check the hooves and pick out any dirt or debris. 4. Saddle and bridle: Once the horse is groomed, Remy needs to place the saddle pad and saddle on the horse, ensuring it's secured tightly. After that, they need to put the bridle and reins on the horse, making sure that every part is adjusted correctly. 5. Warm-up: Remy should spend some time warming up the horse before hitting the trail. This may include walking, trotting, and cantering in circles or other patterns to help loosen the horse's muscles and tendons. 6. Map out the trail: It's important for Remy to know the route they are taking so they can plan accordingly. They should study a map of the trail and take note of any particular challenges or hazards they might encounter. 7. Prepare safety gear: Remy should gather any safety gear they might need during the ride, such as a helmet, reflective clothing, and a cell phone. 8. Pack essentials: Depending on the length and remoteness of the trail, Remy might also need to pack some essentials like water, snacks, a small first aid kit, and any necessary tools for their horse or equipment. 9. Check weather conditions: Before setting out, Remy should check the weather forecast for the duration of the ride. Knowing the expected weather conditions can help them prepare for any challenges they might face. 10. Review the plan with others: If Remy is riding with others, they should all review the plan together and make sure everyone is on the same page.

After setting a new world record of 27 consecutive wins earlier in the season, TNS retained the Nathaniel MG League Cup with victory over Barry Town in January and manager Craig Harrison now wants the league secured as soon as possible. \\"You want to win every single game,\\" Harrison said before their defeat at Carmarthen. \\"Winning football games is enough to motivate me and I've got a likeminded group of staff, a likeminded chairman and likeminded players.\\" \\"I certainly don't get bored of winning and it's something I came into football for.\\" Saints' domination of Welsh football has seen them winning the domestic Welsh treble of the league, Welsh Cup and League Cup for each of the previous two seasons. Despite their unprecedented success and having won the league by a clear seven points in 2015-16, Harrison was not afraid to make changes to his playing squad last summer. \\"A lot of people said it was going to be the hardest season we were going to have,\\" Harrison told BBC Radio Wales Sport. \\"People said we weren't going to win the league at a canter this year and maybe not even at all. \\"A lot of clubs invested heavily and bought some very good players - Connah's Quay, Bangor City and Bala strengthened. \\"It was important that we went out and that we recruited players of a very high standard. \\"We had a bit of a turnaround with the squad with three or four going out and three or four coming in and it's been fantastic. \\"The players have been fantastic from the first game of the domestic season.\\" Saints had come into the current Welsh Premier League season after losing to Apoel Nicosia of Cyprus in the Champions League. They have not progressed beyond the competition's second qualifying round during Harrison's time in charge and the manager wants emulate domestic wins in Europe. The 39-year-old is inspired by the achievements of League of Ireland sides Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers, who have reached the Europa League group stages during the past six seasons. \\"We're certainly not going to take our eye off the Welsh Premier League because you've got to win that to get into the Champions League,\\" Harrison said. \\"You don't want to take your eye off the here and now and winning domestic titles because that's your bread and butter and it get you into the Champions League. \\"But we all know that we need to start trying to get to the third and fourth qualifying round or even the Europa League group stages. \\"You look at Dundalk, who are a huge inspiration for a club like ours and are probably not much bigger. \\"It's probably the same budget and they got to the group stages of the Europa League. Media playback is not supported on this device \\"Shamrock Rovers did the same thing five or six years ago so it's something that certainly is our next step.\\" Saints have already gained international recognition for their achievements this season. In December the Oswestry-based club broke a 44-year-old world record held by Dutch giants Ajax for the longest winning streak in top-flight football. \\"Breaking the world record put us on a global scale,\\" Harrison added. \\"We weren't taking it as seriously as what people were making it out to be. You can't compare TNS to Johan Cruyff's Ajax team and all those top drawer players. \\"But in our own way we're very proud of that of record. To win 27 games in a row in any standard is a huge achievement and a huge feat.\\" Harrison's successful five years at Park Hall - in which he has guided the club to 12 domestic trophies - has seen his name linked with clubs in the English pyramid. The former Middlesbrough and Crystal Palace player admits there has been interest from elsewhere, but for now he is fully focused on achieving further glory with Saints. \\"At this moment in time I'm very happy but I am an ambitious manager. I want to manage as high up as I can,\\" Harrison added. \\"We've won one trophy (Nathaniel MG Cup) and we're in a great position to win the Welsh Cup with a quarter final against Bangor City. \\"And in a week's time we're in the semi-finals of the Irn-Bru Cup against St Mirren. \\"The Irn-Bru Cup has been fantastic for TNS because it's almost been like a European experience every other month. \\"We've had something to prepare for, in and out of the Welsh Premier League.\\"","completion":"TNS failed to clinch the Welsh Premier League title early after losing 1-0 to Carmarthen Town, ending their 31-game unbeaten run in all competitions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide an explanation and justification for this answer, let's go through each of the options: (i) varying number: In chemistry, the atomic number (number of protons) defines an element. If the number of protons were to change, the atom would belong to a different element, not the same one. (ii) three: This could only apply to the element lithium, as it has three protons in its nucleus. However, the statement doesn't specify lithium or any specific element, so we cannot assume all elements have three protons. (iii) zero: All elements have at least one proton in their nucleus; otherwise, they would not be atoms but subatomic particles. (iv) same number: This option correctly reflects that all atoms of a particular element must have the same number of protons in their nuclei.

I was deeply touched by it. The girl's father had died years before and her mother had to work hard to support the family. Many times she had seen her mother working deep into the night but never seen tears on her face. Like her mother this girl also works hard at her lessons and she is really good at any of them. I even didn't know anything about her unlucky family. She always appears happy every day so she is really liked by us all, both the students and teachers.

Summarize this article: Moderately increasing your physical activity can help reverse insulin resistance. You don’t have to get ready for a marathon. Just choose a physical activity that you enjoy or are interested in picking up. This way, you're more likely to become active. You may start walking more, climbing more stairs, doing more outdoor activities, hiking, gardening, aerobics, Tai chi, yoga, using an elliptical, using a rowing machine, using a stationary bicycle, or stretching. Consider whether you want to work out alone, with someone else, or play a group sport. Start with 10 minutes of activity a day. When you're comfortable with that level of activity, add a few minutes every week. For example, you may tell yourself to walk more. You might try parking your car farther from the office or getting off of the elevator two or three floors early so you can take the stairs the rest of the way. Increase these amounts by parking even farther away or taking more flights of stairs. Avoid setting an extreme goal for yourself early on. You'll be more likely to remain active if you set small, achievable goals. Once you've been working out for a while, start to challenge yourself. Work yourself up to 30 minutes of activity a day for at least 5 days of the week. To keep things interesting, you may want to mix up the activities you do. For example, you might swim for 20 minutes and jog for 10 minutes one day. Consider joining a gym and getting a personal trainer.

Here is a news article: VATICAN CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was invited to speak at an April 15 Vatican event by the Vatican, a senior papal official said on Friday, denying a report that Sanders had invited himself. U.S. Democratic presidential candidate and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders waits to talk to reporters in New York City April 8, 2016. REUTERS/Brian Snyder “I deny that. It was not that way,” Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo told Reuters in a telephone interview while he was traveling in New York. Sorondo, a close aide to Pope Francis, is chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which is hosting the event. He said it was his idea to invite Sanders. A Bloomberg report quoted Margaret Archer, president of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, as saying that Sanders had broken with protocol by failing to contact her office first. “This is not true and she knows it. I invited him with her consensus,” said Sorondo, who is senior to Archer. An invitation to Sanders dated March 30, which was emailed to Reuters, was signed by Sorondo and also included Archer’s name. ||||| Is Sanders’ Trip to the Vatican a Good Use of His Time? Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ plan to attend a Vatican-sponsored conference put him in the middle of a diplomatic row as a senior Vatican official accused the senator of showing “monumental discourtesy” in angling for an invitation that puts a political cast on the gathering. Sanders, whose foreign policy experience is under attack by competitor Hillary Clinton, said Friday he was “very excited” to have been invited to the conference on economic and social issues hosted by a pontifical academy in Rome on April 15. It will put him at the seat of the Roman Catholic Church four days before the New York primary. It has also inserted Sanders into a dispute among Vatican officials. The president of the academy said Friday that Sanders didn’t follow proper protocol -- he failed to contact her office -- and that his presence threatens to make the event political. The academy’s chancellor said he arranged the invitation and defended the Vermont senator. “Sanders made the first move, for the obvious reasons,” Margaret Archer, president of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences, which is hosting the conference, said in a telephone interview. “He may be going for the Catholic vote but this is not the Catholic vote and he should remember that and act accordingly -- not that he will.” ‘Categorically Untrue’ Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sanders, disputed Archer’s comments and said the characterization of the invitation is “categorically untrue. The invitation came to the senator from the Vatican.” His campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, said the trip wasn’t calculated to help the candidate’s appeal to Catholic voters in the New York primary. Jeff Weaver: Bernie Sanders Won’t Cancel Vatican Trip Sanders’ travel to the Vatican, a day after a debate with Clinton and just before the primary, injects into the Democratic nominating contest the agenda of Pope Francis, one of the most popular world leaders whose papacy is especially admired by the political progressives who play an outsized role in Democratic primaries. The public complaint by Archer feeds into criticism by Clinton of Sanders’ inexperience in diplomacy and dealing with foreign institutions, a central role of the U.S. president. Archer, an English social scientist appointed the head the pontifical academy in 2014, said that while she “quite liked” Sanders’ program on paper, his failure to contact her first is a breach of protocol. “The president of the academy organizing this event has not been contacted with monumental discourtesy,” she said, referring to herself. First Move Sanders “made the first move two or three days ago,” Archer said. She did not know whom he or his representatives contacted. “His use of it is clearly a pretext,” she said. “There are just 20 academics and there will be nothing of policy relevance.” However Bishop Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, the chancellor of the Academy, speaking on the phone from New York, said he extended the invitation to Sanders, though he repeatedly declined to say who initiated the contact. “We are interested in having him because we have two presidents coming from Latin America. I thought it would be good to have an authoritative voice from North America,” Sanchez Sorondo said. Asked when the invitation was extended, he said, “Quite some time ago.” Archer didn’t respond to subsequent phone and e-mail requests from Bloomberg News for a response to Sanchez Sorondo’s remarks. Academy Invitation A copy of the invitation to Sanders provided by the chancellor’s office is dated March 30 and signed by Sanchez Sorondo. The letter says he’s inviting the senator “on behalf of” Archer and the conference organizers. An announcement about Sanders’ participation, also under Sanchez Sorondo’s name, was released early Friday. Bolivian President Evo Morales and Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa are listed as speakers at the event on the academy’s website. Sanders isn’t listed as a speaker. Sanders, who has made economic disparities the centerpiece of his campaign, earlier on Friday said, “This is an invitation from the Vatican, from a pope that I have enormous respect for in term of the level of consciousness that he’s raising on the need to have morality in our economy.” Weaver said on Bloomberg Television’s “With All Due Respect” Friday that Sanders has “great affinity” for the pope and his message on the moral economy, adding that he has no intention of canceling the trip to continue campaigning in New York, which will be a pivotal contest in the Democratic race. “Some things are more important than politics,” Weaver said. “When you get invited by the Vatican, I think you go.” The office of the pope moved to distance the pontiff from the visit. Father Federico Lombardi, the Pope’s spokesman, said Sanders had been invited “not by the pope but by the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences.” Lombardi told the Italian news agency Ansa: “For the moment there is no expectation that there will also be a meeting with the pope.” Pope’s Agenda Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Francis has raised the Catholic church’s emphasis on issues of poverty, environmental stewardship, and aid to refugees. The pope already has played a role in this year’s election through criticism of anti-immigrant policies embraced by Republican candidates. He caused a stir in February with his response to a journalist’s question about Republican Donald Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the U.S. southern border with Mexico to prevent immigrants from crossing illegally. “A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” the Pope said. He demurred when asked if Catholics should vote for Trump. Presidential candidates, including Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, made tours of foreign capitals to respond to criticism of inexperience on the world stage. In both cases, they traveled to multiple countries and waited until after they had clinched their party’s nominations. The conference Sanders will attend marks the 25th anniversary of an encyclical by Pope John Paul II that criticized excesses of unfettered capitalism. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In simple words, Bernie Sanders, who wants to be the president of the United States, was invited to speak at a special event at the Vatican, which is a very important place for the Roman Catholic Church. Some people in the Vatican said that Bernie invited himself, but a very important person in the Vatican, Monsignor Marcelo Sanchez Sorondo, said it was his idea to invite Bernie.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: I saw this movie a million years (5 years to be exact) ago for the first the time. In the light of recent events with the Australian woman Schapelle Corby being imprisoned in Indonesia for so called smuggling pot, I decided to watch this movie again. I excepted to cry my heart out, 'cause I'm sucker for hot girls in need (just read my review of 'the stalking of Laurie Show'). Some moist escaped my eyes, but it were hardly buckets filled with tears. Why? Not because the two heroines weren't utterly adoring and helpless, not because the movie wasn't heartbreaking at the sight of these two kids in the prime of their live locked up in almost inhuman conditions. Why then? Why did I not cry? I wanted to cry! When I rent a movie like this, I except to be moved, to sob like there's no tomorrow, to feel miserable and like it. This movie was simply too short to do this. It was just like the script was reduced to the main plot elements, and while doing this the psychological aspect was thrown aside. Clare Danes and Kate Beckinsale did an excellent job portraying the emotions of the two friends, but this movie just screamed for more footage of these girls in their depressing (and oppressing) surroundings. The mental journey is missing here for some reason. You only get to see the key moments of it (which are very touching, I admit), probably because of bad editing. Sometimes I felt these girls were walking around in a postcard. The relationship with the family members could also have used a bit more attention. What's up with the relationships between the girls and the parents (especially between Alice and her dad)? You catch a glimpse of it, but the film doesn't quite offer the whole picture, sadly enough. Nonetheless this was a great movie, and at the end I even had to bite my lip a bit. But I guess this has more to do with the acting skills (and the looks) of the actresses (and the music) then with the merit of the director. To be honest, I hardly knew who Kate Beckinsale was before I watched this movie (again). Now, I am a fan! Great movie, as long as you don't expect it to be classic cinema.

The key to making a long distance relationship work is to maintain open communication, consistently show your commitment and support, and foster a strong connection despite the miles that separate you. In this article, we will explore strategies for ensuring that you and your partner not only survive but thrive in a long distance relationship. 1. Stay in Contact Communication is the lifeblood of any relationship, and it becomes even more crucial when you are separated by distance. Establish regular communication, whether through daily phone calls, texts, video chats, or emails. It’s important to maintain that connection with your partner, even if you’re unable to be together physically. 2. Talk About the Mundane, Little Things Sharing the small, everyday details of your life can help bridge the gap between you and your partner. Don’t brush off these seemingly insignificant moments – they enable you to build a shared understanding of each other’s daily routines and nurture a deeper emotional connection. The mundane details are also a reminder that your partner is an active presence in your life, even at a distance. 3. Visit Often Physical touch and being in each other's presence are tremendously important aspects of a relationship. Whenever possible, plan visits to see each other – these reunions will reinforce your connection and provide opportunities for making precious memories together. It is also helpful to plan for the next visit, giving both of you something to look forward to and count down to. 4. Get to Know Each Other Invest time in getting to know your partner deeply. Even if you’ve been together for a while, there’s always more to learn about each other. Be curious, ask questions, and show genuine interest in their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This process of discovery will help to strengthen your bond and develop a richer understanding of your partner. 5. Remember that Your Partner is Human Being in a long distance relationship can sometimes lead to idealizing the other person and putting them on a pedestal. Remember that your partner, like all of us, has their flaws and imperfections. Accepting your partner as a complete and complex person can create a healthier, more realistic foundation for your relationship. 6. Support Each Other, Even Over the Distance Give and receive emotional support from your partner. Share your challenges, successes, fears, and joys – and encourage your partner to do the same. Be present and empathetic, offering reassurance when needed. A strong support system is essential for a long distance relationship to thrive. 7. Create Trust Trust is a vital aspect of any relationship, especially in a long-distance context. Be honest, open, and transparent with your partner. Share your feelings and expectations, and strive to create an ongoing dialogue about the relationship. By demonstrating trustworthiness and sincerity, you’ll help build a foundation of trust that is essential for a successful long distance relationship. 8. Be Committed to Each Other Show your partner that they are a priority in your life. Commit to investing time, effort, and resources into nurturing the relationship. Set aside dedicated times for each other, even amidst busy schedules. A strong and unwavering commitment to the relationship is a powerful signal to your partner that you’re in this for the long haul. 9. Don't Do Anything Irrational Just Because You're Angry or Upset Long distance relationships can be emotionally taxing at times, and it’s normal to experience feelings of frustration or anger occasionally. However, reacting impulsively or irrationally to these emotions can be damaging to the relationship. Take a step back, practice self-awareness, and communicate your concerns in a calm and constructive manner. Find ways to address and resolve issues together rather than allowing emotions to drive impulsive actions that can end up hurting both of you. Conclusion Long-distance relationships can be beautiful, enriching experiences – full of opportunities for growth, love, and connection. Implementing the strategies discussed in this article can help you and your partner overcome the challenges of distance and build a rewarding, fulfilling relationship. With dedication, communication, and a healthy dose of patience, the miles between you will only serve to strengthen your unbreakable bond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this: \\"The first Ottoman Medrese was created in İznik in 1331 and most Ottoman medreses followed the traditions of Sunni Islam.\\" \\"When an Ottoman sultan established a new medrese, he would invite scholars from the Islamic world—for example, Murad II brought scholars from Persia, such as ʻAlāʼ al-Dīn and Fakhr al-Dīn who helped enhance the reputation of the Ottoman medrese\\". This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. This sense that the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through globalization is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: \\"Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity.\\" İnalcık also mentions that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans in order to share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan. Hence, this reveals that similar to today's modern world, individuals from the early modern society travelled abroad to receive education and share knowledge and that the world was more interconnected than it seems. Also, it reveals how the system of \\"schooling\\" was also similar to today's modern world where students travel abroad to different countries for studies. Examples of Ottoman madaris are the ones built by Mehmed the Conqueror. He built eight madaris that were built \\"on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madaris for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these.\\" The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for one to get into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): When was the first Ottoman madrasa built?","completion":"The first Ottoman madrasa was built in 1331 in İznik."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: Virally infected cells degrade intracellular viral proteins proteolytically and present the resulting peptides in association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules to CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). These cells are normally prone to CTL-mediated elimination. However, several viruses have evolved strategies to avoid detection by the immune system that interfere with the pathway of antigen presentation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses a predominantly late protein, the BCRF1 gene product vIL-10, that is similar in sequence to the human interleukin-10 (hIL-10). We show here that vIL-10 affects the expression of one of the two transporter proteins (TAPs) associated with antigen presentation. Similarly, hIL-10 showed the same activity. Expression of the LMP2 and TAP1 genes but not expression of TAP2 or LMP7 is efficiently downregulated, indicating a specific IL-10 effect on the two divergently transcribed TAP1 and LMP2 genes. Downregulation of TAP1 by IL-10 hampers the transport of peptide antigens into the endoplasmatic reticulum, as shown in the TAP-specific peptide transporter assay, their loading onto empty MHC I molecules, and the subsequent translocation to the cell surface. As a consequence, IL-10 causes a general reduction of surface MHC I molecules on B lymphocytes that might also affect the recognition of EBV-infected cells by cytotoxic T cells.

Adam A:","completion":"Title: \\"Adam's Covenant\\" Genre: Fantasy/Drama Plot Summary: When the first human, Adam, is created in the Garden of Eden, he forms a mysterious pact with Lucifer, the rebellious angel cast from Heaven. The movie explores the unfolding consequences of this agreement, as two immortal beings find their fates entwined over the centuries. Act 1: The movie opens with Adam (protagonist) discovering the Garden of Eden, where human beings are blissfully innocent, having never experienced hardships or darkness. Lucifer (antagonist), a charismatic fallen angel, observes Adam from afar, intrigued by God's newest creation. Adam, curious about the boundaries of his existence, forms an unlikely bond with Lucifer. Their conversations lead to an enigmatic pact that is meant to ensure Adam's survival and grant Lucifer a foothold on Earth. The deal is struck; Adam will hold Lucifer to his word, and Lucifer will intervene on Adam's behalf when called upon. Act 2: The time fast-forwards a few centuries. Adam, who has retained his immortality, watches over the generations of humanity, realizing the weight of his agreement with Lucifer. Lucifer, too, watches from afar, working discreetly to influence events in favor of chaos and corruption. As the centuries progress, their paths continuously cross, testing the limits of their bond. Adam tries to save humanity from Lucifer's malicious plans, choosing lone individuals who are vulnerable and attempting to guide them toward kindness and compassion. Lucifer, however, is endlessly creative in his schemes to lure people to their darker inclinations. Act 3: The movie culminates in a critical confrontation between Adam and Lucifer. Humanity is on the brink of a catastrophic war, and only a divine intervention can save it from annihilation. As agreed long ago, Adam summons Lucifer to hold him to his promise. Lucifer, bound by their ancient pact, is forced to use his cunning and power to prevent the war. However, the price is heavy: Adam must relinquish his immortality and accept a mortal life. As a symbol of personal growth and redemption, Adam embraces his new existence, trusting in the resilience of the human spirit to continue making the world a better place. In the end, as Adam leaves his immortal life behind, Lucifer, for the first time, reflects on the true meaning of their bond and the profound impact they both had on each other. Their complex relationship leaves the audience wondering who had truly held the upper hand in their centuries-long game of chess."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can do this before going to sleep, at dinner, or halfway through the day. You can do this out loud and with others, or only in your head to yourself. Say thank you to people. After someone has done something nice for you, telling them that you appreciate them can not only make others feel good but can make you feel good as well. Tell your loved ones why you love them. Showing people that you care and are grateful for them can make you less stressed. In addition, your loved ones are more likely to respond positively, and your relationship will be less stressful. For many people, there are certain things that happen that cause stress. Some people find it helpful to recognize in advance what events, things, or people cause them stress (called a “stress trigger”) and remove themselves from the situation. Create a list of times when you get stressed, or what stresses you out. Identify repeating or important factors: “my mother-in-law” or “when it’s 10pm and I still have the dishes to do.” Decide how you want to handle these situations to avoid getting stressed. Often, people find it helpful to think of a reason or way to excuse themselves or ways to communicate with others about their stress in a situation. Try to recognize when stressful events will happen such as looking for warning signs. You want to get good enough that you can anticipate your stress, and take action to avoid getting stressed. For example, if you become stressed when you still have dishes to do late at night, you can avoid your stress trigger by choosing to do the dishes right when you get home. Alternatively, you can ask someone else living with you to do the dishes earlier. It is easy to try to do too many things and overwork yourself. If you do not take time explicitly just to relax, you might increase your stress level. Make sure you unwind during the day to handle your stress and blood pressure. Do something calming that you enjoy. This might include reading, watching TV, yoga, window-shopping, walking, or doing a crossword. Do nothing. Some people consider meditation and focused breathing to be incredibly relaxing. Some also say meditation helps with control over their emotions and thoughts. Your social life is incredibly important to your happiness and health. Spend time around people you enjoy to have a good time and destress.

Context: Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Before going to Iberia, Napoleon decided to address several lingering issues with the Russians. At the Congress of Erfurt in October 1808, Napoleon hoped to keep Russia on his side during the upcoming struggle in Spain and during any potential conflict against Austria.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Every Breath You Take\\" is a song by the English rock band The Police, from their fifth and final studio album Synchronicity (1983). The lead vocalist and bassist, Sting (Gordon Matthew Thomas Sumner), is the primary songwriter and singer of the song. Born on October 2, 1951, in Wallsend, England, Sting is well-known for not only his contribution to The Police but also for having a prolific solo career after the band's disbandment. The Police was formed in 1977, with members Sting, Andy Summers (guitarist), and Stewart Copeland (drummer). They gained significant fame in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. The band was popular for mixing various musical styles such as rock, reggae, punk, and jazz, which resulted in a unique and distinctive sound. \\"Every Breath You Take\\" was released as a single on May 20, 1983. It features an unforgettable guitar riff by Andy Summers, memorable lyrics, and a beautiful melody, which ultimately contributed to the song's massive success. The track reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100. It remained at No. 1 on the US chart for eight consecutive weeks and became one of the most popular and iconic songs of the 1980s. The song's lyrics are often interpreted as portraying romantic love, but Sting once explained that it was written from the perspective of a possessive and obsessive individual, making it more about control and surveillance. This darker underlying theme has led to various interpretations and discussions about the song's true nature over the years. In summary, the song \\"Every Breath You Take\\" was sung by Sting, who was the lead vocalist of the English rock band The Police. The track, written by Sting, became one of the most successful and recognizable songs of the 1980s, solidifying The Police's status as one of the most celebrated bands of their time."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

I took my cat to a vet the cat was given drugs for a cold but the","completion":"cat's condition didn't seem to improve even after a week, so I decided to schedule another appointment to further investigate the issue and make sure my feline companion was receiving the best care possible. At the new appointment, the veterinarian conducted a thorough examination, taking into account not only the unchanging symptoms of the cold, such as sneezing, coughing, and nasal discharge, but also looking for other potential underlying issues that might be contributing to my cat's deteriorating health. Given that my cat was lethargic and had a decreased appetite, the veterinarian also recommended running a complete blood count and a blood chemistry panel to assess the overall health of my pet. As we waited for the test results, the veterinarian asked me about my cat's environment and lifestyle, trying to determine if there were any factors that had remained unnoticed but could be aggravating its symptoms. We discussed my cat's diet, daily routine, activity levels, and exposure to other animals, and found that there had been no significant changes in its routine lately. Once the blood work results were in, the veterinarian pointed out that there were some elevated white blood cell levels, indicative of a more severe infection than previously anticipated. Additionally, the blood chemistry panel results showed some imbalances in electrolytes, suggesting that my cat was dehydrated as a result of the prolonged illness. Taking these findings into consideration, the veterinarian adjusted the treatment plan for my cat. She prescribed a stronger antibiotic in order to better target the stubborn infection while also suggesting that we administer subcutaneous fluids for a few days to support the rehydration process. Furthermore, she recommended using a humidifier in the room where my cat spends most of its time to help alleviate the congestion and promote easier breathing. I followed the vet's recommendations diligently, closely monitoring my cat's response to the new treatment plan in order to identify any signs of progress. It was crucial for me to make sure that my feline friend was on the road to recovery. I gave the prescribed medications promptly, added a soothing humidifier in the room, and paid extra attention to the cat's needs, offering fresh water and enticing, nutritious food frequently. Over the next couple of days, I began to notice small yet encouraging improvements in my cat's health. Its sneezing fits and coughing episodes became less frequent, and the nasal discharge gradually diminished. Noticing that my cat was getting better filled me with relief, as I wanted nothing more than to see my furry companion healthy and lively again. After about two weeks, my cat had fully recovered from the cold and was back to its playful, energetic self. This experience taught me the importance of being attentive to my cat's well-being, paying close attention to any unusual symptoms, and seeking professional help as soon as possible. It also reminded me that, as a cat owner, it is my responsibility to provide a safe, comfortable, and healthy environment for my pet to thrive in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This was not what I expected. I purchased the large one since I have two loving cats. The large is not enough for both of them. If you are the type of person who does not check the litter every day, this is not the box for you. I found that when I check the box every other day, it wasn't sufficant. I was finding a box that gave me the freedom from cleaning each day. If you go away for a few days and have someone take care of your kittys, this would not be something you would want to come home to. Also, if you do not have it connected correctly, it spills every where. I went back to the traditional littler box since I have to check it everyday until I find one that suits my needs. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light.

Northern region where the animals are exposed to a lot of abiotic stress, and the southern region, where the animals experience almost no abiotic stress. Hint: Biodiversity is determined by many things, and one of them is abiotic stress. If an environment is highly stressful, biodiversity tends to be low. If abiotic stress does not have a strong presence in an area, the biodiversity will be much higher.This idea leads into the understanding of how abiotic stress and endangered species are related. It has been observed through a variety of environments that as the level of abiotic stress increases, the number of species decreases. This means that species are more likely to become population threatened, endangered, and even extinct, when and where abiotic stress is especially harsh. The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the regions mentioned: Northern region and Southern region. 2. Find information about abiotic stress in these regions: Northern region has high abiotic stress and Southern region has low abiotic stress. 3.

Second question: I have a family member living in Canada, so can get permanent residence in Canada? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Possible answers: 1). no 2). yes","completion":"First question: The best method for getting a visa for a newly married Indian spouse of an Indian permanent resident of Canada The most appropriate procedure for getting a visa for a newly married Indian spouse of an Indian permanent resident based in Canada is through the Family Class Sponsorship category of the Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). The Canadian government gives high importance to family reunification, making it possible for permanent residents to sponsor their spouses to join them in Canada. Below are the steps to follow: 1. Determine eligibility: First and foremost, you should ensure that both sponsor (the permanent resident) and sponsored person (the newly married spouse) meet the eligibility criteria. The sponsor must be a Canadian permanent resident, at least 18 years old, and willing to sign an agreement to provide financial support, if needed. The spouse must be legally married to the sponsor and be at least 18 years old. 2. Submit application package: The sponsor should gather all necessary documents, including forms, verification documents, and other paperwork relevant to the situation. Some of the important documents needed include a marriage certificate, photographs, passport, birth certificate, and language test results (if applicable). 3. Review application: It is crucial to review the application thoroughly, ensuring that all required information has been provided, appropriate signatures affixed, and supporting documents submitted. 4. Pay application fees: The application fees, which include processing fees, right-of-permanent-residence fees, and biometric fees, should be paid using a valid payment method. 5. Submit application: Once the application package is completed and reviewed, it should be mailed to the IRCC Centralized Intake Office in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, for further processing. 6. Application processing: IRCC will review the application and may request additional documents or information, if needed. They may also request that the spouse undergo a medical examination and biometric screening. 7. Decision: Based on the assessment of the submitted information, the IRCC will make a decision on whether to grant the spousal sponsorship application. If the application is approved, the spouse will be granted a permanent resident visa in Canada. Second question: Can a person get permanent residence in Canada if they have a family member living there? Having a family member living in Canada can help in obtaining permanent residence, but it does not guarantee it. The Canadian government has instituted various immigration programs designed to reunite family members; however, said family member must meet specific eligibility criteria to be considered as an applicant. For the Family Class Sponsorship program mentioned above, eligible relationships include spouses, common-law partners, dependent children, parents, and grandparents. Other family members, such as siblings, nieces, or nephews, may not be sponsored through the Family Class Sponsorship program. Nonetheless, having a close relative living in Canada can offer some benefits in other immigration categories. For instance, in the Express Entry system that manages Federal Skilled Worker, Federal Skilled Trades, and Canadian Experience Class programs, applicants receive additional points if they have a sibling living in Canada. Additionally, some Provincial Nominee Programs (PNPs) also consider having a connection to the province through a family member as one of their selection criteria. In conclusion, the two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question specifically addresses the best method for obtaining a visa for a newly married Indian spouse of an Indian permanent resident in Canada, while the second question focuses on whether having a family member living in Canada can potentially help someone become a permanent resident themselves. Although both questions address aspects of Canadian immigration, they cover separate subjects and scenarios. Therefore, the correct answer is: 1).

All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya.

It has a population of about 25 million, making it the second most populous city after Mumbai and most populous urban agglomeration in India and 3 largest urban area in the world. Urban expansion in Delhi has caused it to grow beyond the NCT to incorporate towns in neighbouring states. At its largest extent, there is a population of about 25 million residents . According to data released by Oxford Economics, Delhi NCR urban agglomeration has replaced Mumbai Metropolitan Region urban agglomeration as the economic capital of India. However the comparison of the figures specific to the Metropolis of Delhi and Metropolis of Mumbai was not provided by this institution. These figures however did not match with those revealed by the reserve bank of India, The economic survey of India, The economic survey of Delhi and Maharashtra. - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Maharashtra (Marathi: pronunciation: , abbr. MH) is a state in the western region of India and is India's third-largest state by area and is also the world's second-most populous sub-national entity.

Let's break down the differences between them. 1. \\"The large area of black is shaded first with green and then with blue.\\" In this sentence, the large area of black is initially shaded with the green color. After the green shading is complete, the same area is then shaded with the blue color. This implies that the green shading occurs before the blue shading. Depending on the materials and techniques used, the final visual effect might be different, as the blue shade could either mix with the green shade or cover it completely. 2. \\"The large area of black is first shaded with blue and then with green.\\" In this sentence, the large area of black is initially shaded with the blue color.

These binders often feature colorful and eye-catching designs and are an essential school accessory. 2. An elegant mansion, in contrast, is a large and luxurious house that often exudes a sense of grandeur. The decoration and design of such mansions tend to be more sophisticated and costly. Now, based on the goal – to acquire stickers – we can evaluate each option: (A) Decorating trapper keepers in a fun way with stickers is a common practice, especially among school-going children and individuals who want to personalize their school supplies. By incorporating stickers into the design, people can make their trapper keeper more visually appealing and express their personality. As stickers come in various shapes, sizes, and themes, there is considerable flexibility in customization. This method directly involves the use of stickers and is an engaging way to achieve the goal of obtaining and utilizing them. Stickers in this context are not only meaningful, but their acquisition and usage serve the intended purpose. (B) Decorating an elegant mansion in a fun way with stickers would be an unconventional approach, as stickers generally don't align with the sophistication and grandeur associated with mansions. Most mansion owners would prefer other forms of decoration that reflect the mansion's elegance, like high-quality furnishings, artwork, or other refined embellishments. Using stickers to decorate a mansion is not only an improbable method, but it also undermines the ultimate objective: to acquire and make use of stickers in a more suitable context. In conclusion, based on the goal of obtaining stickers, option (A) – decorating trapper keepers in a fun way – is the more reasonable method. This approach involves using stickers in a relevant and appropriate context, while option (B) – decorating an elegant mansion in a fun way – doesn't quite align with the fundamental premise of using stickers for personalization and enjoyment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Both gross and tragic. The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. Question: How long ago was the women involved in the crime deemed young? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The woman involved in the crime was deemed young 38 years ago, as mentioned in the context provided. At that time, she was involved in the 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack, which led to tragic events unfolding at the Nyack Hospital."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This movie, which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver-less, moving vehicle, has quite the quirky little personality to boot. The cast of seven (although one girl doesn't hang around for the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is) are all super-hot, as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert (an odd but effective choice of setting), who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck. It predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date (\\"The Trip\\", \\"Joy Ride\\", \\"Jeepers Creepers\\") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. The killer himself is quite creepy, and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in Jennifer McAllister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black, while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire, as scanty and stonewashed as it may be). Director Bill Crain does some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on screen, and the cast tries their absolute best. There's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough T&A from a couple of the girls to please T&A fans. Overall, this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video. Highly recommended.

I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

To provide a better understanding, here is the revised and complete process: 1. Accumulation of organic material: Dead plants and microorganisms accumulate in an anoxic environment such as the seafloor or in a freshwater sedimentary basin, where they are protected from decomposition by the lack of oxygen. 2. Over time, more sediment piles on top: These organic remains become buried under additional layers of sediment, which can include sand, silt, and clay. 3. Heat and pressure transform the organic layer into kerogen: As the layers of sediment build up, the increased pressure and temperature cause the organic material to undergo chemical changes, forming a dark, waxy substance known as kerogen. 4. Kerogen molecules eventually crack: With even more time, pressure, and heat, the kerogen molecules start to crack, breaking their chemical bonds. 5. Formation of hydrocarbon molecules: As the kerogen molecules crack, they break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen atoms. These are the basic building blocks of hydrocarbons, which include petroleum and natural gas. 6. Final transformation into petroleum or natural gas: The specific composition of the hydrocarbon molecules and the prevailing geological conditions determine whether the end-product will be petroleum, also known as crude oil, or natural gas, composed mostly of methane, ethane, propane, and butane. This entire process typically occurs over millions of years, and the resulting petroleum or natural gas can migrate upward, accumulating in reservoir rocks such as porous sandstone or fractured limestone, where it can be extracted through drilling and other techniques."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: 20 Million Miles to Earth Movie plot: Off the coast of a small Italian fishing village, Sperlonga (in the province of Latina), not Sicily as it is erroneously mentioned, two fishermen watch in amazement as a spaceship pierces the skies and crashes into the sea. The men, Mondello (Don Orlando) and Verrico (George Khoury), row out to the site and pull two space travelers from the capsized craft before it shudders and sinks into the sea. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Major General A. D. McIntosh (Thomas Browne Henry) discovers that the government's missing spacecraft, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder (William Hopper), has been located off the coast of Italy. As McIntosh flies to Italy, Pepe (Bart Braverman), a little boy who lives in the fishing village of Gerra, finds a metal capsule that has washed up on the beach. Upon opening the capsule, he finds a jelly-like glob inside and sells it to Dr. Leonardo (Frank Puglia), a visiting zoologist who is studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's medical-student granddaughter Marisa (Joan Taylor) is summoned to town to take care of the injured Calder and his companion, Dr. Sharman. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds Sharman in the last throes of the fatal disease that decimated his crew. That night, after Marisa returns home to the trailer that she shares with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the glob and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size, and McIntosh arrives in Gerra, accompanied by government scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with Calder and Signore Contino, a representative of the Italian government. As Leonardo and Marisa hitch up the trailer containing the creature to their truck and head for Rome with their discovery, McIntosh informs the astonished Contini that Calder has just returned from Venus. Calder's spacecraft, crippled by a meteor, carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn species of animal life from the planet. As police divers begin to search for the capsule, McIntosh offers a reward for its recovery, prompting...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Sakic was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, to Marijan and Slavica Sakic (originally Sakic, Croatian pronunciation: [Sakitc]), immigrants from Croatia in what was then Yugoslavia. Growing up in Burnaby, he did not learn to speak English well until kindergarten, having been raised with Croatian as his mother tongue. At the age of four, Sakic attended his first NHL game, a match between the Vancouver Canucks and Atlanta Flames; after watching the game, Sakic decided that he wanted to become a hockey player. As a smaller player, he was forced to use skill rather than size to excel, and modeled himself after his idol, Wayne Gretzky. Sakic was drafted 15th overall by the Quebec Nordiques in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Rather than make the immediate jump, he told the Nordiques management he would prefer to spend the 1987-88 season in Swift Current to prepare for the NHL. He made his NHL debut on October 6, 1988, against the Hartford Whalers and registered an assist. His first NHL goal came two days later against goaltender Sean Burke of the New Jersey Devils. During the season, he wore #88 because his preferred number, #19 was already taken by a teammate, Alain Cote. While considered a front-runner for the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year due to his rapid scoring pace, an ankle injury that forced him to miss 10 games in December and the resulting scoring slump helped quash any hopes of winning the award. He would finish his rookie season with 62 points in 70 games. In 1989-90, his second NHL season, Sakic was able to switch his number back to his familiar #19 (Alain Cote had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At the start of the next season, 1990-91, he was named co-captain along with Steven Finn (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during 1991-92 to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while Mike Hough was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the Eric Lindros holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, \\"We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game.\\" Lindros was traded a year later, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the Adams Division and last in the entire league for three straight years, from 1989 to 1991. Starting with the 1992-93 season, Sakic became the sole captain of the franchise. Under his leadership, the Nordiques made the playoffs for the first time in six years and set a franchise record for wins and points in the process (since broken by the 2000-01 Colorado Avalanche team). Sakic reached the 100-point plateau, the third time he did so in five years, by scoring 48 goals and 105 points in the regular season, and added another six points in the playoffs. In the shortened 1994-95, after the 1994-95 NHL lockout, Sakic was eight points behind Jaromir Jagr for the scoring title with a fourth-place finish, and helped the Nordiques win the division title, their first since the 1985-86 season. Sakic had an extensive international hockey career, representing Canada at seven international competitions. After being drafted by the Nordiques in 1987, he went on and helped Canada win the 1988 World Junior Championship. His next tournament was the 1991 World Championships, where Canada won the silver medal and Sakic contributed eleven points in ten games. He tried out for the 1991 Canadian Canada Cup team, but was the first player to be cut, being cited for his weak leg strength. Sakic was bitter about the experience, feeling he was not given a good enough chance to prove himself, and called the whole experience \\"a complete waste of time.\\" Sakic's first successful professional tournament was the 1994 World Championships, where Canada won its first gold medal in the tournament since 1961. Sakic's seven points in eight games were a crucial part of the team's success. During the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, he played only a minor role in Canada's second-place finish as he scored one goal and two assists in six games. However, the tournament allowed him to showcase that he was indeed a dominant player who had simply been overlooked. Sakic's first Olympic appearance came in 1998 at Nagano, Japan, after the event allowed NHL players to compete for the first time. Bothered by a knee injury, he only scored three points in four games, as the Canadian squad failed to meet expectations and finished in fourth. Sakic's second Olympic appearance came in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Led by his strong play, the Canadian team played their way to the gold medal match against Team USA, where Sakic had four points and helped the team win its first gold medal in 50 years. He was later named MVP of the tournament with a cumulative tally of four goals and six assists and became one of the first Canadian members of the Triple Gold Club. Sakic also played a part in Canada's triumph in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, where he scored six points in six games. On December 21, 2005, Sakic was named captain of Team Canada for the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Once again, Team Canada was heavily favored and given high expectations, but they failed to medal, finishing seventh overall. Sakic finished the tournament with three points. After he retired, Sakic decided to take time off from hockey and spent time with his family. In 2011, two years after his retirement, Sakic returned to the Avalanche to work in their front office. He was named an executive advisor and alternate governor for the team, effective at the end of the 2010-11 season. In his role as an advisor, Sakic would advise the team in hockey-related matters, and as an alternate governor, would represent the team at Board of Governors meetings. On June 26, 2012, Sakic was selected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 12, 2012, along with Mats Sundin, Pavel Bure and Adam Oates. Sakic was the only member of his class who won the Stanley Cup during his career. On May 10, 2013, the Avalanche promoted Sakic to Executive Vice President of Hockey Operations. In this expanded role, Sakic has the final say on all matters regarding hockey personnel. During Patrick Roy's time as head coach, they shared most of the duties normally held by a general manager. General Manager Greg Sherman remained in his post, but served mainly in an advisory role to Roy and Sakic. This de facto arrangement was formalized the following season, when Sakic was formally named general manager and Sherman was demoted to assistant general manager. Apart from his two years away from hockey, Sakic has spent almost three decades with the Nordiques/Avalanche organization as either a player or executive.","completion":"This text is about Joe Sakic, a former professional ice hockey player and current executive for the Colorado Avalanche in the National Hockey League (NHL).

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: The First of March is my most hated day of the year. Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff. Question: After the end of the story, the narrator is probably feeling Answer: The answer is:","completion":"After the end of the story, the narrator is probably feeling a bit more uplifted and cheerful. This is inferred from how the narrator mentions lifting their end of Summer blues by giving themselves a bright, cheerful manicure. The color they chose, a luscious purple cream, was likely also chosen to evoke a feeling of happiness and brightness to combat the sadness they feel about the impending end of their favorite season, summer. Furthermore, using a nail polish brand that avoids harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde likely contributes to their improved mood, as they have a considerable aversion to the substance due to their background in Forensics. Thus, although the beginning of March causes them some sadness because it signals the end of their preferred season, their self-care and conscious choices likely leave them feeling somewhat cheered up by the end of the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He made his debut for India in the 2003/04 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, and was a core member of the national team until a decline in form set in during 2006, forcing him out of the team. Since then, he has been in and out of the limited-overs teams (ODIs and T20Is), and has only sporadic appearances in Test cricket. Pathan played his last Test in April, 2008 at the age of 24. At the start of the 2000-01 season, Pathan was immediately back in the Under-19s, this time bowling more, often delivering more than 20 overs per innings. In four matches, he scored 102 runs at 102.00 including a best of 63 not out, and took 10 wickets at 32.50. He was then promoted to the Under-22s, where he scored 44 and took 4/71 in his first match against Saurashtra, prompting the Baroda selectors to propel him into the senior team. In 2003-04, he was then selected for India Emerging Players for a series of limited-overs matches against counterparts from Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Pathan took seven wickets at 11.00 in three matches, including 4/22 and 3/35 in two matches against Pakistan. In late 2003, he was selected for the India Under-19 team to compete in an Asian youth ODI competition in Pakistan, where he was the leading bowler with 18 wickets at 7.38, with an economy rate of 3.54. This was more than twice that of the second leading wicket-taker. He was named as the player of the tournament, which India won after defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final. Pathan was featured on the headlines when he claimed 9/16 against Bangladesh, helping to bowl them out for 34, and helped India to emerge victorious over Sri Lanka in the final, taking 3/33. Pathan also scored 94 runs at 31.33 with the bat, compiling scores of 32, 28 and 34. Pathan returned to India and took 3/51 and 1/33 and scored 26 and 12 in his first Ranji Trophy match for the season, against Andhra Pradesh.

Then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as Steven Spielberg's Minority Report or Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly. An amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director Christian Volckman's bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut. But although Volckman's work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them, such a simplistic hybrid does not do Renaissance, Volckman's end result, justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that. Genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. As such, Renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least, with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama, which serve to compliment each other's storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion. The screenplay is a clever and intriguing one (although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the English translation - the film's title also becomes far more poignant) managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through. Though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers, the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes, making for a truly compelling work. Volckman's film truly excels in its visual component, and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film's highlight - superbly moody and stylish, it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have. With tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot, and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene, the film appears straight out of a Frank Miller comic, but with a twist, the end result being consistently visually sumptuous. The film's English rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting. The gruff voice of Daniel Craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim, stoic policeman Karas, and Catherine McCormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister's disappearance he is investigating. Despite a wavering English accent, Romola Garai does great work as the frantic sister in question, and Jonathan Pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation Avalon. Ian Holm's reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist, and Holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes. All together, Renaissance boasts a visually stunning, unique and compelling futuristic thriller, just as intelligent as it is entertaining. Though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be, the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms. For fans of either of the film's intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of Frank Miller, or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted, slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller, the film is without question worth a watch. -8/10 What is the sentiment of this review? pick from the following.

Choose from: -- yes -- it is not possible to tell -- no","completion":"yes The premise tells us that \\"A little boy in a yellow shirt looks at something he holds in his hand.\\" This means that the boy is looking at whatever he is holding. The hypothesis says, \\"A boy looks at what he holds.\\" Since both statements talk about the same situation of the boy looking at what he holds in his hand, we can say that the premise tells us the hypothesis is true. The other options, \\"it is not possible to tell\\" and \\"no,\\" are wrong because the premise gives us enough information to show that the hypothesis is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do the following two sentences have the same meaning? Three-year-old Jaryd Atadero vanished on Oct. 2 , 1999 while on a hiking trip with a church group . He was on a hiking trip that day with a church group .","completion":"While both sentences convey that Jaryd Atadero was on a hiking trip with a church group, they do not have the exact same meaning due to the differences in information provided and the focus of each sentence. The first sentence, \\"Three-year-old Jaryd Atadero vanished on Oct. 2, 1999, while on a hiking trip with a church group,\\" emphasizes the event of Jaryd's disappearance. It provides specific details about his age (three years old) and the exact date of the incident (October 2, 1999). The primary focus of this sentence is the mysterious vanishing of the child. The second sentence, \\"He was on a hiking trip that day with a church group,\\" highlights the fact that Jaryd was on a hiking trip with a church group on the day in question. This sentence does not explicitly specify his age or the exact date of the trip. Additionally, this sentence does not directly address the fact that Jaryd vanished during the hike. The main focus here is the context of the occurrence, which is the hiking trip and the church group's involvement. In summary, both sentences relay the information that Jaryd Atadero was on a hiking trip with a church group, but they differ in terms of their focus and the level of detail provided. The first sentence emphasizes the disappearance event and offers more specific information, while the second sentence mainly revolves around the context of the event - the hiking trip and the church group Jaryd was with at the time."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","completion":"To accurately answer the question \\"What is the regular price?\\", one would need to know the context and the specific product or service being referred to. The regular price typically refers to the standard cost of a product or a service before any discounts, promotions, or other adjustments are applied. However, without any further information on the product or service in question, it is impossible to provide an exact value or even a ballpark estimation. There are various scenarios and entities that would be able to answer this question given the appropriate context, including: 1. Retail store staff or customer service: If the question was regarding the regular price of an item in a physical store, a salesperson or staff member would be able to provide that information. They are familiar with their inventory and pricing systems and can either look up the price or know it from memory. 2. Online retailer websites: When shopping online, the regular price of an item is usually displayed on the product's webpage. If there are any applicable discounts or promotions, those would be shown alongside the regular price. Most e-commerce platforms also include search filters to browse items within certain price ranges. 3. Manufacturers: In some cases, contacting the manufacturer of a product directly could provide you with information on the regular price. They would have the suggested retail price (MSRP) for their products, although it's important to note that third-party retailers may offer different prices. 4. Market research and price comparison tools: There are various platforms and tools that allow users to compare prices across different retailers or service providers. These could help you determine the regular price of a specific product or service by showing the range of prices offered by various sellers. Keep in mind that the accuracy of these tools depends on data availability and frequency of updates. 5. Asking other consumers: Forums, social media groups, and discussion boards are popular platforms where people discuss prices and share their experiences. By participating in these communities, you could potentially find an answer to your question, as someone in the group may have recently purchased the same item or service. In summary, the regular price of a product or service can be best answered by someone or something with specific knowledge or access to that particular item's pricing information. This could range from retail store staff and manufacturers to online research tools and discussions with other consumers. This information would be more accurate if the context of the product or service in question could be provided, such as the product's name, brand, or the service provider."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: This article: Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person to whom Bartok dedicated the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928?, what is it ?

Write an article based on this \\"Inverness Caledonian Thistle have parted company with manager Richie Foran following relegation from the Scottish Premiership.\\"","completion":"Title: Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Richie Foran Part Ways Following Relegation Introduction In a recent turn of events, Inverness Caledonian Thistle Football Club has announced their decision to part ways with their manager, Richie Foran, following the team's relegation from the Scottish Premiership. This move comes as a blow to Richie Foran's managerial career as he hoped to help the club maintain their status in the top tier of Scottish football. This article will delve deeper into the fallout between the club and their manager, examining the reasons behind the split, Foran's management history at the club, and what the future might hold for both parties. Background Inverness Caledonian Thistle, commonly known as Caley Thistle or simply ICT, is a professional football club based in Inverness, Scotland. Established in 1994, the club has shown remarkable growth over the years, reaching the pinnacle of Scottish football – the Scottish Premiership. However, the 2016-2017 season proved to be a catastrophic campaign for the team, resulting in their relegation to the Scottish Championship for the first time since 2010. Richie Foran, a former player and captain of the team, took over as the club’s manager in 2016 after the departure of John Hughes. Despite his dedication and commitment to the club, Foran was unable to yield positive results as the team struggled throughout the season. Reasons for Parting Ways There are a few reasons why Inverness Caledonian Thistle decided to part ways with Richie Foran after the team's relegation from the Scottish Premiership. 1. Poor Performances: In the 2016-2017 season, under Foran's management, Inverness found themselves at the bottom of the Scottish Premiership table, leading to their eventual demotion to the Scottish Championship. The performance of the team was unconvincing and lacked the energy and drive needed to compete in such a fiercely contested league. 2. Lack of Experience: As a relatively new and inexperienced manager, Richie Foran faced an uphill battle trying to manage a team struggling in a high-pressure environment. Despite his passion for the club and dedication to his role, it became clear that his inexperience significantly contributed to the team's poor performance. 3. Inability to Turn Things Around: Despite Foran's many efforts, including overhauling the squad and implementing various tactics and formations, the team failed to respond positively. Inverness continued to struggle and, ultimately, could not recover from their downward spiral. 4. Long-Term Stability: The club's top priority following relegation is to regain their spot in the Scottish Premiership as quickly as possible. This necessitates a fresh approach with a new manager who can steer the club back to its previous successes. Inverness Caledonian Thistle believes that parting ways with Foran is in the best interest of the club’s long-term stability and growth. Foran's Management History with the Club Richie Foran, a former Irish footballer, became Inverness Caledonian Thistle's manager in 2016, following the departure of John Hughes. As a former player and captain for the club, he enjoyed a strong connection with the fans and had a good understanding of the club's culture. However, his tenure as the team’s manager was marred by poor performances, leading to the club's relegation from the Scottish Premiership the following year. What Lies Ahead for Both Parties 1. Inverness Caledonian Thistle: The club's immediate focus will turn to finding a suitable replacement for Foran. They will look for an experienced manager with a proven track record in turning struggling teams around and guiding them to success. Once a new manager is in place, the team can focus on rebuilding and regaining their position within the Scottish Premiership. 2. Richie Foran: For Foran, this marks the end of a bittersweet chapter in his managerial career. Despite his dedication and hard work, he was unable to save the team from relegation. However, this experience may provide valuable lessons for him moving forward. The Irishman will likely take some time to assess his options and decide on the best course of action for his future managerial career. Conclusion In conclusion, the parting of ways between Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Richie Foran is an unfortunate but necessary decision following a disappointing season. The club now faces the task of rebuilding and regaining their place in the Scottish Premiership. For Foran, the future may be uncertain, but he can draw on the lessons learned from his time at Inverness as he charts a new path in his managerial career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - friendly - smile - greeting - introduce yourself - look over The answer is \\"introduce yourself\\" because A:","completion":"Introducing yourself is an essential and significant step when meeting people for the first time, as it sets the foundation for building relationships and establishing rapport with others. Although being friendly, smiling, offering a greeting, and making eye contact are also important when meeting new people, these actions should be seen as complementary components of the introduction process that work in conjunction with the main task of introducing oneself. Introducing yourself entails sharing basic information about who you are, what you do, and possibly mentioning some of your interests or goals. This helps to create a sense of familiarity and understanding between you and the person you have just met. It gives the other person an opportunity to form a mental image of you, as well as providing a basis for future conversations and interactions. Being friendly, on the other hand, is a valuable trait that contributes to the overall atmosphere and ambiance during the introduction phase. A friendly demeanor encourages a pleasant and welcoming environment, making the other person feel at ease and more likely to reciprocate the positive energy. However, being friendly alone does not provide enough information about who you are, which is why it cannot be considered the primary strategy for meeting people for the first time. Smiling is another important aspect of making a good first impression, as it demonstrates warmth and approachability. A genuine smile can instantly put others at ease, making them more receptive to further interaction. However, like friendliness, smiling alone is not enough to convey all the necessary information about yourself. A proper greeting, such as saying \\"Hello\\" or \\"Hi,\\" is a polite and respectful way to initiate a conversation with someone you have just met. It serves as an icebreaker and an indication of your willingness to engage with the other person. Nonetheless, the greeting itself does not provide much insight into your identity, which is why it is not sufficient as a standalone solution. Looking over someone might be a natural response when meeting new people, as one might want to assess the other person's appearance, body language, or overall demeanor. However, this action is not an effective means of introducing yourself and could be perceived as impolite or dismissive in some situations. In conclusion, while being friendly, smiling, offering a greeting, and making eye contact all contribute positively to the process of meeting new people, they are not adequate substitutes for properly introducing yourself. The act of introducing yourself is the most crucial step, as it provides the necessary foundation for establishing connections and forming relationships with others. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize introducing oneself when meeting people for the first time, followed by complementing that introduction with friendly gestures, a smile, a greeting, and attentive eye contact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[ii] Rachel moved infrequently.. Answer:","completion":"Rachel moved infrequently. Thus, the decision came down to their contrasting lifestyles. Lindsey, being a more settled individual, possessed the stability to welcome a foster cat into her home with open arms. She understood the responsibilities and commitment associated with caring for a feline companion, and her predictable routine would enable her to create a secure and nurturing environment for the animal. On the other hand, Rachel's more nomadic lifestyle meant that adopting a foster cat would not only be impractical, but also potentially detrimental to the cat's well-being. In spite of Rachel's strong desire to become a foster parent to a cat in need, she accepted the reality of her current situation and acknowledged that her frequent moves would not permit her to provide the appropriate level of care for the animal. Foster cats, like any pets, require a constant presence and stable living conditions in order to thrive. Rachel's frequent relocations and the resulting changes in living environments would only add undue stress on any cat under her care. Moreover, the process of acclimating the cat to new surroundings over and over again could hinder its chances of developing a strong bond with her. However, Rachel's passion for helping animals did not end with this realization. Instead of adopting a foster cat, she opted to contribute in alternative ways. She started volunteering at local animal shelters on weekends, assisting in cleaning, feeding, and playing with the animals to make their temporary homes more comfortable. Rachel also kept a close eye on the progress of Lindsey's foster cat and offered her support whenever she could, whether it was through offering advice, accompanying Lindsey and the cat on vet visits, or just being there to share in the joys and challenges of foster pet parenting. Together, Lindsey and Rachel supported one another as they both pursued their dreams of making a difference in the lives of cats in need. Lindsey's stable and nurturing home environment allowed her to provide foster care to multiple cats over time, each one eventually finding their forever homes. Rachel's volunteer work at the animal shelter not only brought comfort to the animals but also positively impacted the shelter's resources, ensuring it could continue providing refuge to displaced cats. Through their combined efforts, Lindsey and Rachel came to realize that contributing to animal welfare was not confined to a single method or path.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: In my early 20s, I was a one-on-one aide for a couple of teenagers with cerebral palsy. With the first one, I was hired by and worked for the family. I picked the teen up from school every day and took care of him until he was in bed for the night. When he passed away, I took a job with the local school district. My client at the school had spastic quadriplegia. He could talk and was actually very smart, but he had no control over his arms or legs. He couldn’t walk. He was never going to walk. The law requires that special education students be put in the least restrictive classroom environment possible. Since this kid was smart and could communicate well, and wasn’t a discipline problem, he had all regular classes. His only accommodation was a one-on-one aide (me), and he was allowed to be late to classes without consequence because we sometimes had to stop in a special room, get him out of his chair, and stretch his legs a little. Basically ten minutes of physical therapy, two or three times per day. Anyway, since this kid was legally required to take all the classes a normal student his age would take, he had to take Physical Education (gym). And, legally, his aide (me) had to accommodate his participation in every class as much as possible, including gym. Most gym classes began with the students doing laps around the track, then participating in a team sport. He couldn’t do the team sport, but, according to the lawyers involved, he should participate in the “laps around the track” part of gym. So I had to push this kid in a wheelchair around the track for about 15 minutes each day, until the other kids were all done and off doing the next activity. Then he and I were able to leave gym class and go do some physical therapy in his own little room just for that. Because, you know… lawyers and rules.

The surroundings cause them to recall their relationship as young women, and the summers they had enjoyed there in the past. They reflect on the passage of time, and the bitterness, jealousies and misunderstandings that slowly festered over the years and kept them from establishing a true closeness in their relationship. Libby, played by Davis, is the elder and the more infirm of the two sisters, and her nature has become bitter and cold as a result. Sarah, played by Gish, is the younger sister, a softer and more tolerant character, intent on nursing her sister through her discomfort and trying to breach the gulf that has grown between them. The resentment that Libby so clearly displays to her stifles Sarah's every attempt at making a friendly overture towards her, and Sarah cautiously retreats from her. Ironically, Gish was actually 15 years older than Davis. Maranov (Price) is an expatriate from Russia who has recently lost the friend that he has been living with. Tisha (Sothern) is a vivacious lifelong friend who provides common sense, fun and laughter, and is the catalyst for some of the sisters' conversations and revelations.

Carroll, an RAF flying instructor, and actress Hazel Bainbridge (born Edith Marion Bainbridge; 25 January 1910 - 7 January 1998). Her younger sister is actress Belinda Carroll. After boarding school she attended art school before becoming a full-time actress. O'Mara made her stage debut in a production of The Merchant of Venice in 1963, although her first film role was some years earlier (under the name Merrie Carroll) in Home and Away (1956) with Jack Warner, as her father, and Kathleen Harrison. Her earliest television appearances, in the 1960s, included guest roles in Danger Man, Adam Adamant Lives!, The Saint, Z-Cars and The Avengers. In 1970, she appeared in two Hammer Studio horror films: The Vampire Lovers and The Horror of Frankenstein. In the former, she had an erotically charged scene with Ingrid Pitt, in which O'Mara was meant to be seduced; the two women were left laughing on set, however, as Pitt's fangs kept falling into O'Mara's cleavage. O'Mara's work in The Vampire Lovers impressed Hammer enough for them to offer her a contract, which she turned down, fearful of being typecast. She had a regular role in the BBC drama series The Brothers (1975-76) as Jane Maxwell, and in the early 1980s, O'Mara starred in the BBC soap opera Triangle (1981-82), sometimes counted among the worst television series ever made. She played the villainous Rani in Doctor Who. The character, as played by O'Mara, appeared in two serials, The Mark of the Rani (1985) and Time and the Rani (1987) and the Doctor Who 30th Anniversary Special Dimensions in Time (1993), part of the Children in Need charity event. Between these appearances in Doctor Who, she played Caress Morell in the American primetime soap opera Dynasty. As the sister of Alexis Colby (Joan Collins), O'Mara appeared in 17 episodes of the sixth season and 4 episodes of the seventh during 1986. \\"We had a tremendous bitchy tension between us\\", the actress recalled about performing opposite Collins. \\"My character Caress was like an annoying little mosquito who just kept coming back and biting her.\\" O'Mara disliked living in California, preferring the change of seasons in Britain, and to her relief was released from her five-year contract after Collins told the producers that having two brunettes in the series was a bad idea. After returning to the UK, she was cast as another scheming villain, Laura Wilde, in the BBC soap Howards' Way (1989-90).

Jeanette Anna MacDonald (June 18, 1903 - January 14, 1965) was an American singer and actress best remembered for her musical films of the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier (The Love Parade, Love Me Tonight, The Merry Widow and One Hour With You) and Nelson Eddy (Naughty Marietta, Rose-Marie, and Maytime). During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars ( In the mid-1950s, MacDonald toured in summer stock productions of Bitter Sweet and The King and I. She opened in Bitter Sweet at the Iroquois Amphitheater, Louisville, Kentucky, on July 19, 1954. Her production of The King and I opened August 20, 1956, at the Starlight Theatre. While performing there, she collapsed. Officially, it was announced as heat prostration, but in fact it was a heart seizure. She began limiting her appearances and a reprisal of Bitter Sweet in 1959 was her last professional appearance. MacDonald and her husband, Gene Raymond, toured in Ferenc Molnar's The Guardsman. The production opened at the Erlanger Theater, Buffalo, New York, on January 25, 1951, and played in 23 northeastern and midwestern cities until June 2, 1951. Despite less than enthusiastic comments from critics, the show played to full houses for virtually every performance. The leading role of \\"The Actress\\" was changed to \\"The Singer\\" to allow MacDonald to add some songs. While this pleased her fans, the show still closed before reaching Broadway. In the 1950s, talks with respect to a Broadway return occurred. In the 1960s, MacDonald was approached about starring on Broadway in a musical version of Sunset Boulevard. Harold Prince recounts in his autobiography, visiting MacDonald at her home in Bel Air to discuss the proposed project. Composer Hugh Martin also wrote a song for the musical entitled, \\"Wasn't It Romantic?\\". MacDonald also made a few nightclub appearances. She sang and danced at The Sands and The Sahara in Las Vegas in 1953, The Coconut Grove in Los Angeles in 1954, and again at The Sahara in 1957, but she never felt entirely comfortable in the smoky atmosphere.","completion":"This text is about Jeanette Anna MacDonald, an American singer and actress who was best remembered for her musical films in the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier and Nelson Eddy.

Sentence from a movie review: roiling black-and-white inspires Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review \\"roiling black-and-white inspires,\\" it is quite difficult to make a definitive conclusion as to whether the movie was seen positively or negatively. However, let's analyze the sentence to try to decipher some meaning. The phrase \\"roiling black-and-white\\" suggests that the film uses black-and-white cinematography. Roiling is an adjective that typically describes a churning or turbulent motion, which, when used to describe cinematography, could express a sense of movement, agitation, or intensity in the visual presentation of the film. The word \\"inspires\\" can often be seen as a positive term, as it usually implies that something is moving, uplifting, or thought-provoking. In the context of the movie review, this could mean that the way the black-and-white cinematography has been executed in the film is engaging and innovative, sparking emotions or ideas within the viewer. While one could interpret the sentence as being positive based on the use of the word \\"inspires,\\" it's essential to take into account that individual words within a sentence can be insufficient to make a complete judgment on whether the movie was viewed positively or negatively overall. The context of the entire review and the opinions of the critic matter, and without more information, it is challenging to make a well-informed conclusion. In summary, based on the limited information provided in the sentence from the movie review, it is difficult to determine with certainty whether the movie was seen positively or negatively. However, considering the use of the term \\"inspires,\\" there might be a positive element in the way the movie's black-and-white cinematography was executed.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise, let's analyze the given statements. Premise: This person doesn't want to see a particular movie because they love buffaloes and know that the ones in the movie are fake. The person expresses a strong interest in and affection for buffaloes. However, this statement doesn't specifically mention any related information, such as having pictures of buffaloes at home. Hypothesis: The person has a lot of pictures of buffaloes at home. It can be assumed that someone who loves buffaloes might have pictures of buffaloes at home. However, just loving buffaloes doesn't necessarily mean the person has pictures of them at their residence. The individual could appreciate buffaloes through different means, such as visiting them in the wild, at sanctuaries, or through online photos or videos. To clarify further, let's look at the logical structure of the given statements. Premise: Interest in buffaloes ➝ Doesn't want to see the movie (Positive correlation between love for buffaloes and not wanting to see the movie) Hypothesis: Interest in buffaloes ➝ Having pictures of buffaloes at home (Positive correlation between love for buffaloes and having pictures at home) The premise and hypothesis have one common element, which is the person's interest in buffaloes. However, their relationship to the conclusion (having pictures at home) is not explicitly stated in the premise. Therefore, it is merely an assumption based on common sense but isn't guaranteed to be accurate. In conclusion, while it is plausible that the person may have pictures of buffaloes at home based on their affection towards them, we cannot directly infer the hypothesis from the premise since it lacks explicitly stated information that confirms the conclusion. The premise provides insight into the person's love for buffaloes but does not give enough evidence to support the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Information: - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ariidae or ariid catfish are a family of catfish that mainly live in marine waters with many freshwater and brackish water species . They are found worldwide in tropical to warm temperate zones . The family includes about 143 species . - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms). - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'ariidae' with the relationship of 'parent taxon'. Choices: - animal - area - areas - argentina - bacteria - corydoradinae - corydoras - fungi - hagfish - human - loricariidae - mammal - olfactores - pangasianodon - plant - siluriformes - silurus - trichomycteridae - vandellia The answer is:","completion":"- Siluriformes The Ariidae, or ariid catfish, belong to the order Siluriformes, making Siluriformes the parent taxon of Ariidae. In biological classification, a parent taxon is a taxonomic category (for example, a species, genus, family, or order) to which another, more specific, taxon is subordinate. Here's a more detailed explanation: In biological taxonomy, animals are grouped based on their characteristics and evolutionary history. Each species belongs to a specific genus. Each genus, in turn, belongs to a specific family. Each family is part of an order, which belongs to a class, and so on, up to the highest rank - the domain. This hierarchical classification system is rooted in a concept called monophyletic groups, or clades. Each clade is a group of organisms that consists of a single common ancestor and all its lineal descendants. The \\"parent taxon\\" is essentially the next highest rank in this hierarchy. In the context of the question, the Ariidae, or ariid catfish, is a family of catfish. They belong to the order known as Siluriformes. Hence, the parent taxon of Ariidae is Siluriformes. It's important to note that the Ariidae family is further divided into various genera and species. The term \\"parent taxon\\" is often used in the context of phylogenetic trees, which are branching diagrams or \\"trees\\" showing the inferred evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other entities based upon similarities and differences in their physical and/or genetic characteristics. The parent taxon is a larger, more inclusive category. In essence, the parent taxon is the next highest rank up from the category under consideration. In this case, the category under consideration is the family Ariidae, and the next highest taxonomic rank is the order Siluriformes. Therefore, Siluriformes is the parent taxon of Ariidae."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the question: This article: Sir Georg Solti, (born György Stern; 21 October 1912 – 5 September 1997) was a Hungarian-born orchestral and operatic conductor, best known for his appearances with opera companies in Munich, Frankfurt and London, and as a long-serving music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Born in Budapest, he studied there with Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner and Ernő Dohnányi. In the 1930s, he was a répétiteur at the Hungarian State Opera and worked at the Salzburg Festival for Arturo Toscanini. His career was interrupted by the rise of the Nazis' influence on Hungarian politics, and being of Jewish background he fled the increasingly harsh Hungarian anti-Jewish laws in 1938. After conducting a season of Russian ballet in London at the Royal Opera House he found refuge in Switzerland, where he remained during the Second World War. Prohibited from conducting there, he earned a living as a pianist. After the war, Solti was appointed musical director of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich in 1946. In 1952 he moved to the Oper Frankfurt, where he remained in charge for nine years. He took West German citizenship in 1953. In 1961 he became musical director of the Covent Garden Opera Company, London. During his ten-year tenure, he introduced changes that raised standards to the highest international levels. Under his musical directorship the status of the company was recognised with the grant of the title \\"the Royal Opera\\". He became a British citizen in 1972. In 1969 Solti became music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 22 years. He relinquished the position in 1991 and became the orchestra's music director laureate, a position he held until his death. During his time as the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's eighth music director, he also served as music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975 and principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra from 1979 until 1983.

Title: Rock Star Movie plot: Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) is a Pittsburgh fanatical admirer of a 1980s heavy metal band called Steel Dragon. By day, Chris is a photocopier technician and by night, he is the lead singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band called Blood Pollution (the name is taken from a Steel Dragon song). Internal struggles among the actual Steel Dragon band members culminate with the firing of their lead singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), and the starting of recruitment sessions to find a new vocalist. Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm (Timothy Olyphant). During a live performance, Rob's playing fails to live up to Chris' over-demanding standards regarding note-for-note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon recordings, and Chris sabotages Rob's amplifier mid-song - a fight breaks out between the two onstage. The next day, Chris arrives at Blood Pollution's rehearsal space (the basement of an X-rated theater) to find that he's been fired and replaced with his arch-rival, the (now former) lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob also cites Chris' inability to create his own musical style, preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band. One day in 1984, Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon's founder and rhythm guitarist, Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West), and is offered an audition for the band (thanks to two of Blood Pollution's groupies, who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution's concerts). After hanging up on Kirk once, thinking he's being made fun of, Chris ecstatically agrees. At the studio, he meets the band, as well as learning that Bobby Beers was fired because he was a closeted gay, and gives an outstanding performance of \\"We All Die Young\\" (a Steel Dragon song in the movie, but it is actually a song by Steelheart, whose lead vocalist Miljenko Matijevic provides Cole's singing voice for the film).

Question: Given the below context: The village is home to the Briarcliff Manor Union Free School District, which covers 6.58 square miles (17.0 km2) of land and most of the village of Briarcliff Manor and an unincorporated portion of the town of Mount Pleasant. Parts of Briarcliff Manor not covered by the school district include Scarborough and Chilmark; these areas are part of the Ossining Union Free School District. The district serves over 1,000 students and includes Todd Elementary School, Briarcliff Middle School, and Briarcliff High School. From Briarcliff Manor's settlement until 1918, students in grades 1–8 were taught within one school facility; from 1919 until the 1940s, students in grades 1–12 were as well. The district is noted for its annual high-school musicals. The elementary school (opened in 1953) is named after George A. Todd, Jr., who was the village's first teacher, first superintendent of schools, and taught for over 40 years. The middle school became a Blue Ribbon School in 2005.Briarcliff Manor has been home to a number of schools. Long Hill School was a public school in Scarborough until 1912, with about 70 students, two classrooms, and two teachers. Dr. Holbrook's Military School was on Holbrook Road from 1866 to 1915. Miss Tewksbury's School and later Mrs. Marshall's Day & Boarding School for Little Girls was at Dysart House. Miss Knox's School ran from 1905 in Pocantico Lodge, a hotel on Pleasantville Road under Briarcliff Lodge management. When it burned down in 1912, the school moved to Tarrytown and then to Cooperstown. Since 1954, the Knox School has been located at St. James, New York. The Scarborough School was first Montessori school in the United States; it was located at the Beechwood estate from 1913 until it closed in 1978. Since then, The Clear View School has run a day treatment program for 83 students from nursery school age to 21 there.

First, we have to simplify the equation. We can do that by combining the numbers without the letter \\"b\\". So we have -137039 + 15288 = 1598 * b + 47183 - 17124 Now, let's add and subtract numbers on both sides: (-137039 + 15288) = (47183 - 17124) -121751 = 30059 Now, the equation is: -121751 = 1598 * b + 30059 Next, we want to isolate \\"b\\" by moving the number without \\"b\\" to the other side. To do that, we will subtract 30059 from both sides of the equation: -121751 - 30059 = 1598 * b Now, we have: -151810 = 1598 * b Next, we want to find the value of \\"b\\". To do that, we will divide both sides by 1598: -151810 ÷ 1598 = b And after dividing, we get: b ≈ -95 So the solution for the equation is b ≈ -95.

In an attempt to prove her father's death was not in vain, she is determined to become the best agent and close out the cases that have long remained unsolved. One day, her mentor, Agent Jack Crawford, assigns her with an unprecedented task - to interview the notorious and manipulative psychiatrist-turned-serial-killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The objective is to extract valuable information to help solve a recent string of grisly murders that have left the country in fear. Agent Crawford believes that Dr. Lecter holds the key to identifying the serial killer, known only as \\"The Shadow.\\" Act 2: The Interview and The Road to Enlightenment Clarice, undeterred by the stories she has heard about the brutal nature of Dr. Lecter, enters the high-security prison, which is a far cry from her day-to-day work. She is determined to build a rapport with Dr. Lecter and hopes that he might reveal critical information. Their initial conversations prove challenging as Dr. Lecter's unnerving, intellectual, and taunting nature threatens Clarice's strong resolve. However, through her perseverance and by sharing discrete information about her past, she gradually gains Dr. Lecter's trust and curiosity. During their conversations, Clarice also starts to learn about the intrinsic works of Dr. Lecter's psyche and the gruesome details of his own actions. Simultaneously, in the outside world, another victim is discovered along with evidence that suggests \\"The Shadow\\" is growing bolder and more dangerous with each passing day. The race against time begins for Clarice to decipher the cryptic clues provided by Dr. Lecter and apprehend the elusive killer before it is too late. Act 3: The Unraveling of Two Worlds Clarice becomes increasingly absorbed in the twisted, dark world of Dr. Lecter as she delves deeper into the psyche of \\"The Shadow.\\" As the personal connection between Clarice and Dr. Lecter grows, she finds herself beginning to question her own moral boundaries. A parallel is drawn between the complex relationship of Clarice and Dr. Lecter and that of the predator and prey, echoing through the entire film. With \\"The Shadow\\" on the brink of leaving no more traces, Clarice finally cracks the code that leads them to the shocking revelation of the serial killer's identity - a high-ranking, respected police officer who once worked alongside her father. This realization shatters Clarice's perception of the world and those she has trusted, and her determination to bring \\"The Shadow\\" to justice becomes personal. Act 4: Climactic Showdown and Resolution Meanwhile, Dr. Lecter, with the help of his cunning mind manipulation tactics, manages an elaborate escape from his confinement. He leaves Clarice one last cryptic message, setting her on a path to face her destiny. In the final confrontation between Clarice and \\"The Shadow,\\" she finds herself in a life-or-death struggle. Against all odds, Clarice manages to overcome her adversary, avenging her father's death and closing the case that has tormented her for so long. Clarice, having faced her darkest fears and finding the strength to bring \\"The Shadow\\" to justice, returns to the prison only to find that Dr. Lecter has vanished. The film ends with ambiguous hints about the possible continuation of their relationship, leaving Clarice and the audience to ponder if the entangled worlds of good and evil can always be kept separated or if, at times, lines blur and grasp the fragile threads of humanity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What piece was composed as a tribute to Albert Libon?, using the article: For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music. Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere. In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged. His four-act \\"drame lyricque\\", Le timbre d'argent (\\"The Silver Bell\\"), to Jules Barbier's and Michel Carré's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production. The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances.The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy \\"To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition\\". Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died. He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities. After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all.

Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Drunken driving--sometimes called America's socially accepted form of murder--has become a national epidemic . Every hour of every day about three Americans on average are killed by drunken drivers, adding up to an incredible 250,000 over the past ten years. A drunken driver is usually defined as one with a 0.10 blood alcohol content or roughly three beers, glasses of wine or several glasses of whisky drunk within two hours. Heavy drinking used to be an acceptable part of the American manly image and judges were serious in most courts, but the drunken slaughter has recently caused so many well-publicized tragedies, especially involving young children, that public opinion is no longer so tolerant. Twenty states have raised the legal drinking age to 21, reversing a trend in the 1960s to reduce it to 18. After New Jersey lowered it to 18, the number of people killed by 18-20-year-old drivers more than doubled, so the state recently upped it back to 21. Reformers, however, fear raising the drinking age will have little effect unless accompanied by educational programs to help young people to develop \\"responsible attitudes\\" about drinking and teach them to resist peer pressure to drink. Though new laws have led to increased arrests and tests and, in many areas already, to a marked decline in accidents, some states are also punishing bars for serving customers too many drinks. A bar in Massachusetts was fined for serving six or more double brandies to a customer who \\"obviously drunk\\" and later drove off the road, killing a nine-year-old boy. As the accidents continue to occur daily in every state, some Americans are even beginning to speak well of the 13 years of national prohibition of alcohol that began in 1919, what President Hoover called the \\"noble experiment\\". They forgot that legal prohibition didn't stop drinking, but encouraged political corruption and organized crime. As with the booming drug trade generally, there is no easy solution. Question: What can be inferred from the fact of the traffic accidents in New Jersey? Options: A: The legal drinking age should be raised. B: Young drivers were usually bad. C: Most drivers hoped to raise the legal drinking age. D: Drivers should not be allowed to drink.

Movie title: Bad News Bears Movie plot: Morris Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton) is a washed-up alcoholic baseball player who was a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners before getting kicked out of professional baseball for attacking an umpire. He works as an exterminator and is a crude womanizer. He coaches the Bears, a children's baseball team with poor playing skills. They play their first game and do not even make an out before he forfeits the game. The entire team decides to quit after but Buttermaker forces them out of quitting and promises to be a better coach. Amanda Whurlitzer (Sammi Kane Kraft), a skilled pitcher, is the 12-year-old daughter of one of his ex-girlfriends. After a couple requests, she decides to join the team. Kelly Leak, a local troublemaker but solid hitter, also joins the team, and the Bears start winning games. The Bears eventually make it to the championship game. In the middle of that game, the Bears and Yankees fight after Amanda is shoved during a play at the plate. A few innings later the Yankees coach Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) has his son Joey intentionally walk Mike Engleberg, one of the Bears' best hitters. Instead of walking him, he almost hits Engleberg, causing Ray to push Joey to the ground in anger. As revenge, Joey throws Engleberg an easy pitch which he smacks for a home run and would leave the game with his mother. Later, Buttermaker changes the lineup, putting the benchwarmers in and taking out some of the good players which causes the Bears to fall behind heading into the last half of the inning. With two outs, one of the Bears players, Garo, drives in two runs and tries to score to tie the game but is thrown out at the plate on a close call, causing the Bears to lose the championship 8â7. After the game, Buttermaker gives them non-alcoholic beer, and they spray it all over each other. Although they did not win the championship, they have the satisfaction of trying, knowing that winning is not so important.

Article:For Cave and everyone else competing in the Ironman World Championship in Kailua-Kona on 8 October, Hawaii will mean blistering heat, barren fields of black lava and desiccating crosswinds. There's also the small matter of swimming (2.4 miles), cycling (112 miles) and running (26.2 miles) a total of 140.6 miles. Most people will need a holiday after just reading about it. But Leanda Cave is not like most people. More than 14 years after claiming a triathlon silver medal for Wales at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Cave is preparing to put herself through the one of the toughest challenges facing endurance athletes. And the 38-year-old, who won the event in 2012, has no problem explaining why. \\"It's the glory of winning,\\" she said. Listen again: Leanda Cave on BBC Radio Wales \\"There's nothing like it and I've experienced it - I guess it's almost like a drug, it's an addiction, you want it, you crave it. \\"When you're on the start line you're all going for the same thing, to win a race and it's only one person who can win the race and it's nice to be in the mix and give it a shot.\\" Cave has won world titles at Olympic distance, long distance, half-Ironman and Ironman triathlons. Yet the feeling that she still has something to prove after crashing out of last year's race is part of the incentive for Cave as she goes into the last stages of a month-long preparation in Hawaii. \\"It's funny because I ask myself this same question why I come back every year - and here I am doing it again,\\" Cave explained. \\"Last year I crashed my bike and I thought that would be the end of me. \\"It took a huge emotional toll but then I guess it's that fighting spirit that you want to get to the finishing line and you want to succeed and you don't want things to stop you. \\"So after I got over the emotional stress of crashing last year I felt like I couldn't not come back. \\"I have to get to the finish line and sure it's a year later but it's me wanting to redeem myself for some misfortune in the past.\\" In a sport of extremes, the race in Hawaii takes even Ironman triathlon to the limit of physical endurance and mental stress. In addition to the heat - which can top 90 degrees Fahrenheit - and the distance, there is the wind. It's a blast so notorious it has a name - \\"Ho'omumuku\\". It's a physical force competitors have to battle during the cycle phase in particular, and a dehydrating factor for athletes whose metabolisms are operating at the limits of capability. Cave has won races in Arizona and Florida in a career that has taken her around the world but has the utmost respect for the harsh challenge Hawaii presents for athletes. \\"I always get out here about the month before the race,\\" she said. \\"It's definitely some of the toughest conditions I've experienced in this sport. \\"It's hot and very windy and the terrain is black. It's volcanic and it's just very tough and I like to make sure I'm ready for it not in the physical sense but in the mental sense. \\"This is my 10th year here in Kona and I have had success here in the past. \\"But I've also failed miserably many times and it's just good to come back and feel confident that I know the course and I know the weather and nothing comes as a surprise on race day. \\"I suppose the unique thing about Hawaii is because it's such a tough race it's sometimes not so much the fittest person on the day who wins. \\"It's having everything go right for the one particular athlete on the day - on days when all your cards are right, you get dealt the good hand and somehow magic happens. \\"I feel really good. But this year has not gone as well - I haven't had a very solid season and I wouldn't say that's lack of results or performances, it's just I haven't raced a lot and I've normally raced 10 times a year before I get to Kona. And this year I've dialled it back a bit because I've had several other commitments on the table. \\"But in saying that it's given me a little bit longer to prepare for this event. \\"I'm feeling pretty good but this race I feel at times it's still a bit of a mystery. \\"I'm nervous and I think that's a good thing to come here and not expect to do well, I've got to race smart and put in the best performance I can do.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"In the Ironman World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, on 8th October, athletes will face extreme heat, harsh terrain, and the notorious \\"Ho'omumuku\\" wind while competing in a grueling race that consists of 2.4 miles of swimming, 112 miles of cycling, and 26.2 miles of running.

Along the dark street, he comes to the residence of a creature named The Once-ler, a being who is never seen, except for his long green arms. He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax.The land once thrived with truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage are the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who eat truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond live the Humming Fish, and overhead fly the Swomee Swans. The trees amaze the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon builds a small shop in the area. After cutting down a truffula tree, the Lorax pops out of it's stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demands to know what the Once-ler is doing. The Once-ler explains that he is using the truffula tree's tufts to make something called a Thneed...a fine thing that all people need.The multi-purpose item soon attracts the attention of many customers, and the Once-ler continues to cut down more truffula trees. When it seems that the business is growing too big for just one Once-ler, he calls his relatives to help him with his thriving business.The business keeps growing and growing, until finally the Lorax demands an audience with the Once-ler, explaining that with the number of trees having been cleared, the Bar-ba-Loots have run out of truffula fruits, and have left to find new sources of food.The Once-ler ignores this, but is then met by the Lorax again, who explains that the smog from the factories has overwhelmed the Swomee Swans. Unable to sing because of the smog, the Lorax sends them off. The Once-ler claims he will 'think about it,' but this answer does not sit well with the Lorax. The Lorax then reveals that the factory's pollution is gumming up the Humming Fish's pond.

Yes The premise and hypothesis in this context both inquire about the certainty of chloral being involved. \\"There's no doubt it was chloral?\\" is a question that implies that the assumption or belief is that chloral was indeed involved, and the person is either seeking confirmation or challenging that assumption.

Thus, the premise does entail the hypothesis, as both are essentially posing the same inquiry about the certainty of chloral's involvement.

Political activist and Legislative Council member Leung Kwok-hung (Longhair) also joined the protest, saying \\"I'm very proud that in Hong Kong we still have people brave enough to speak out.\\" Pro-democracy activists were overwhelmed by a crowd of torch supporters with insults like \\"running dog,\\" \\"traitor,\\" \\"get out!,\\" and \\"I love the Communist Party.\\" At the same time, about 10 members of the Civil Human Rights Front had orange banners calling for human rights improvements and universal suffrage. Onlookers were saying \\"Aren't you Chinese?\\" in Mandarin putonghua as they tried to cover the orange banners with a large Chinese national flag. One woman had an orange sign that said, \\"Olympic flame for democracy\\", while a man carried a poster with a tank and the slogan \\"One world, two dreams\\".

She was among the protesters who were advocating for democracy, accountability for the Tiananmen Square incident, and human rights improvements, including universal suffrage. By expressing her opinions and joining the protest, Chan was exercising her right to freedom of speech, assembly, and expression, which are fundamental human rights recognized worldwide. During the protest, Chan wrapped herself in the Tibetan snow lion flag, which represents the Tibetan independence movement, another controversial issue in Chinese politics. The act of displaying this flag might have been regarded as a provocative demonstration against the Chinese government's policies in Tibet. Consequently, she faced verbal abuse and heckling from onlookers in support of the Olympic torch relay and the Communist Party. The Hong Kong authorities intervened and took Chan and some other protesters away involuntarily via a police vehicle. This intervention is what Chan claims to be a breach of her human rights, as it may represent an infringement on her rights to freedom of speech, assembly, and expression. In her lawsuit against the Hong Kong government (case number HCAL139/08), Chan is likely seeking legal acknowledgment of the violation of her human rights during the incident, as well as seeking accountability from the authorities who were responsible for taking her and other protesters away from the scene against their will.

Authorities say that the Chisholms lived in an upscale lakefront home, owned a 1.2 million yacht, and ran a kennel raising elite Cavalier King Charles spaniels, indicative of a wealthy lifestyle that far surpassed the conditions for which welfare programs are provided. The significant amount of public assistance money wrongfully obtained served as a costly burden on taxpayers and disrupted the funds that were intended to go to families in actual need. Lady Chisholm's involvement in the fraud demonstrates the lengths some individuals may go to further indulge in their opulent lifestyles, taking away valuable resources meant for the less fortunate. The sentencing of Lady Chisholm serves as a reminder that the welfare system is designed to provide support to those genuinely struggling to make ends meet, and it is not a tool to be manipulated to finance extravagant lifestyles. The authorities brought the Chisholm case to court to send a clear message about the consequences for those who defraud the welfare system and exploit its services. Welfare fraud not only has financial implications for the taxpayers and the government but also impacts the societal integrity and trust in public assistance programs. Cases like that of the Chisholms risk the credibility of welfare systems and exacerbate the stigma surrounding individuals genuinely seeking assistance. As such, it is essential to crack down on fraud and enforce strict punishment to preserve the integrity of the system. In conclusion, the case of Andrea Chisholm, the self-proclaimed Scottish noblewoman, showcases the severe consequences of abusing the public assistance system. Her one-year prison sentence sends a message to potential fraudsters and ultimately emphasizes the importance of upholding the fairness and functionality of welfare programs. Authorities must continue to remain vigilant in investigating and prosecuting such cases to maintain the trust and legitimacy of public assistance initiatives and ensure that these resources are allocated to those who genuinely require them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Juan Zarate, 38, of San Francisco is facing charges in connection with the incident reported Sunday at the pet store, which is located on S. El Camino Real and West Hillsdale Blvd. Company officials said he has been suspended, pending the outcome of an internal investigation it has launched into the incident. San Mateo police were called to the pet supply store shortly after 5 p.m. to investigate a report of a dog that had died on the premises. Police said they spoke to a San Mateo resident, who told police he brought his 1-year old male Dachshund to the store to be groomed. \\"About three minutes after the groomer took the dog into the back to be groomed, the groomer came out and was saying the dog was having a medical emergency. The owner said that he could see the dog was foaming at the mouth and had some blood in his mouth,\\" said police spokesman Sgt. Rick Decker. \\"We're certain it was not an accident.\\" Decker said the store's veterinarian did a post-mortem X-ray on the dog and discovered he had two broken ribs and a punctured lung. KTVU Viewer Vote The dog died just a few minutes after he was rushed to the on-site vet. Investigators have concluded that Zarate's actions likely contributed to the animal’s death. He was arrested at the scene and booked for Felony Animal Cruelty.

Cheryl Hurd reports. (Published Monday, May 16, 2016) Dog Dies at San Mateo PetSmart While in Care of Groomer A PetSmart groomer has been arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty after a dog died in his care at a store in San Mateo, California, authorities said. The dog, a 1-year-old male dachshund named Henry, died Sunday at the PetSmart in the 3500 block of South El Camino Real. Officers responded and spoke with the dog's owner, a 47-year old San Mateo resident who said he brought Henry to the store to be groomed, according to police. About three minutes later, the groomer, identified as 38-year old Juan Zarate of San Francisco, exited the grooming office holding Henry and told officers the dog was suffering a medical emergency, police said. Henry was bleeding from the mouth and having trouble breathing. Zarate took Henry to the on-site veterinarian, who took emergency measures to try to save him. The dog died a few minutes later, police said. A dog died while in the care of a groomer at a San Mateo PetSmart store. A postmortem X-ray determined Henry had suffered two broken ribs and a punctured lung, authorities said. San Mateo police determined Zarate's deliberate actions contributed to the dog's death. Zarate was arrested at the scene and booked on suspicion of felony animal cruelty. He posted bail Monday and is no longer in custody. It's not clear if he has hired an attorney. The Humane Society will conduct a necropsy on Henry to determine his cause of death. PetSmart said in a statement Monday it is \\"heartbroken over the loss of Henry.\\" \\"Nothing is more important than the health and safety of pets, and we take full responsibility for the pets in our care,\\" PetSmart said. The company said it is conducting an internal investigation, and Zarate is suspended pending the outcome. Juan Zarate has been arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty.

Hartman, who has taken up the cause, said there is no law in California regulating pet groomers. While some are licensed, Hartman said, it's not mandated by the state. A bill dubbed \\"Lucy's Law\\" was proposed in 2012 after a dog was severely injured by a groomer. Lawmakers rejected the measure, and Hartman has been fighting to revive it ever since. \\"If the groomer is no longer working in that salon, he could be grooming a mile down the street,\\" she said. Teri DiMarino, president and founder of the California Professional Pet Groomers Association, said \\"Lucy's Law\\" is not the answer. \\"Legislation and licensing is not going to do a whole lot of good because as with any licensed industry, there is no standard and no test for carelessness and stupidity,” DiMarino said. ||||| Juan Zarate, 38, of San Francisco ( San Mateo County Sheriffâ s Off ) SAN MATEO -- A pet groomer was arrested on suspicion of animal cruelty after a 1-year-old Dachshund died in his care, police said Monday.

Jordan). After commandeering a train in an early morning heist, Cassidy and Sundance come across a treasure map, but with a twist: it reveals the location of a mythical treasure called \\"The Dark Shore,\\" a hidden paradise allegedly filled with untold riches and gold from ancient civilizations. Cassidy and Sundance decide to team up and follow the map, hoping to gain enough wealth to escape their outlaw lifestyles and survive outside the grasp of the law, starting fresh lives in a peaceful, unknown territory. Along the trail, they befriend an enigmatic Native American woman named Running Winds (played by Q'orianka Kilcher) who possesses insight into the mystical legends surrounding the Dark Shore and its connection to her ancestors. Running Winds agrees to help the duo, driven by a desire to reunite with her long-lost tribe and uncover the truth behind the Dark Shore. As Cassidy, Sundance, and Running Winds journey across the treacherous and unforgiving wild west landscape, they encounter a multitude of obstacles, including fierce storms, hostile natives, and even mystical creatures guarding the path to the Dark Shore. Meanwhile, Sheriff Wallace, consumed by his eagerness for capturing the notorious outlaws, continues to hunt them down relentlessly, hellbent on putting an end to their reign of crime. Throughout the journey, the bond between Cassidy and Sundance grows stronger as they learn more about each other's pasts and the experiences that shaped them. At the same time, a romantic tension develops between Sundance and Running Winds, as her resilience, grace, and wisdom captivate the notorious gunslinger. Sundance begins questioning his path and starts to imagine a life with Running Winds, away from the perilous outlaw existence that accompanies being Butch Cassidy's closest companion. As the trio approaches the Dark Shore's hidden location, Cassidy starts to question the authenticity of the treasure and the true cost of finding it. However, driven by their desires for redemption and freedom, they forge ahead while the relentless posse led by Sheriff Wallace rapidly closes in. Upon arriving at the mystical Dark Shore, the trio discovers an astounding truth: the treasure is not gold or material riches, but a powerful secret rooted in ancient wisdom and the revered natural world. Realizing that the greatest treasure is the connection they have formed with one another and Running Winds' people, Cassidy and Sundance make the ultimate decision concerning their fates as outlaws. As the posse finally catches up to the treasure seekers, Cassidy makes a selfless sacrifice, confronting the lawmen, which allows Sundance and Running Winds to escape and start a new life together in the mystical realm of the Dark Shore. In a climactic face-off, Cassidy tests his wit and skill against Sheriff Wallace, providing the ultimate showdown between law and outlaw in the untamed Wild West. \\"Riders of the Dark Shore\\" explores themes of friendship, loyalty, redemption, and the pursuit of freedom against all odds while blending action-packed western adventure with a touch of mysticism and ancient lore – an unforgettable odyssey into the heart of the American frontier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Arpaio already has these posses patrolling local schools, a plan that's not universally adored. Saturday's training session involved a simulated school shooting at a vacant school; 25 teen volunteers took part while posse members practiced how to deal with multiple shooters.

Article:","completion":"Title: Seaport City: A Plan to Expand Manhattan by 500 Feet Hey kids, today we are going to talk about a really exciting plan to expand Manhattan, an important and busy part of New York City, by 500 feet! That's almost as long as two football fields! This idea is called the \\"Seaport City\\" project and it is now considered \\"financially feasible,\\" which means that people who work with money think it's a good idea and they have enough funds to make it happen. Are you ready to learn more? Great! Let's go! If the Seaport City plan becomes a reality, it could provide two new city blocks. A city block is a big piece of land with buildings, trees, and roads. Think about the blocks you see when you play with your toys - they would be like that, but much, much bigger. Adding these two city blocks means that more people would have space to live, work, and play in Manhattan. But that's not all! The Seaport City project could also help keep Manhattan safe from floods. Remember when it rains a lot and sometimes puddles form on the ground? Well, sometimes there's so much water, it can cause a flood. Floods can be dangerous because they can damage houses, roads, and other things we need. Seaport City could be built with a levee scheme, which is kind of like a big wall made to protect the area from too much water. Where would this new Seaport City be? If everything goes as planned, it will stretch from East 13th Street to Corlears Hook Park. That's a big space to cover! So, what do you think? Wouldn't it be great to have a bigger, safer Manhattan for everyone to enjoy?

Use this fact to answer the question: wind is used for producing electricity wind is used for producing","completion":"electricity To answer the question about how wind is used for producing electricity, let's break down the process into steps and consider the underlying principles involved: Step 1: Understand the basics of wind energy Wind is a form of kinetic energy created by the movement of air. As the sun's rays heat the Earth's surface, the heat creates temperature differences resulting in air movement. This movement of air contains kinetic energy that can be harnessed and converted to other forms of energy, such as electricity. Step 2: Identify the technology behind wind energy conversion Wind turbines are the primary technology used to harness and convert wind energy. These turbines come in various sizes and shapes, but they all rely on wind passing through their blades to generate electrical power. Step 3: Analyze the wind turbine's components and functioning The main components of a wind turbine include the rotor, blades, a generator, and a tower. The rotor is connected to the blades, and as the wind blows, the force causes the rotor to spin. The spinning rotor then drives a generator, which converts the mechanical energy (i.e., kinetic energy) into electrical energy. The generated electricity is then sent through a power grid for distribution. Step 4: Explore the advantages and disadvantages of wind energy Wind energy has both advantages and disadvantages. On the positive side, wind energy is a renewable resource, meaning it won't run out over time, and it produces zero emissions or pollution. This makes it an environmentally friendly option for power generation. However, on the negative side, wind energy is variable and intermittent, as wind speeds and directions can change frequently. Additionally, wind turbines can be expensive to install and may have negative effects on local wildlife and aesthetics. So, in conclusion: Wind is used for producing electricity by harnessing the kinetic energy of air movement through wind turbines. These turbines convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical energy, which is then distributed through power grids. While wind energy is a renewable and environmentally friendly source of power, it has its share of challenges like variability and costs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"Don't be a little fool! \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Don't be ridiculous.\\"?","completion":"If we assume that the premise \\"Don't be a little fool!\\" is true, we can analyze the relationship between this premise and the hypothesis \\"Don't be ridiculous\\" to understand whether one entails the other. First, we need to understand the meaning of both statements. The premise \\"Don't be a little fool!\\" is a cautionary statement directed at an individual, advising them to avoid behaving foolishly or naively. The intent is to motivate the person to engage in reasonable, clear-headed thinking and act sensibly. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"Don't be ridiculous\\" is an admonition against engaging in absurd, irrational, or nonsensical behaviors or thoughts. This statement also encourages the individual to embrace rationality and logic in their decision-making process. Now, we look at the connection between these two statements: 1. Both statements share a common theme: They advocate for rational and reasonable behavior. 2. They both share the same directive or instructional format. They communicate their meaning by giving orders or instructions to the individual. 3. The language used in both statements is somewhat informal and conversational. Given these similarities, it can be argued that there is a relationship between the two statements. However, the key question is whether the premise \\"Don't be a little fool!\\" entails the hypothesis \\"Don't be ridiculous.\\" Entailment is a relationship between two statements where the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of the other. While \\"Don't be a little fool!\\" and \\"Don't be ridiculous\\" share similarities, the first statement does not necessarily entail the second statement. Acting foolishly or naively is not the same as acting ridiculously. However, there is some overlap in the behaviors and actions that would fall under both categories. For example, while someone acting foolishly might make a naïve or uninformed decision, that doesn't necessarily mean the decision is completely absurd or nonsensical. On the contrary, someone acting ridiculously may be engaging in actions that are not only irrational but also exaggerated, bizarre, or otherwise inappropriate for the situation. In conclusion, the premise \\"Don't be a little fool!\\" does not necessarily entail the hypothesis \\"Don't be ridiculous,\\" despite the similarities and overlapping characteristics of the two statements. The primary difference between them lies in the degree of irrationality and absurdity involved in the behavior being warned against. Though there may be instances where these two statements apply to the same situation, the truth of one statement does not guarantee the truth of the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What was exactly \\" reborn\\" during the Renaissance? To answer this question, we need to look back at the time of the Roman Empire. At this time Roman artists, scientists and writers influenced by Greek ideas were the world's most advanced. They had become skilled observers of the natural world around them, and had become experts in studying animals, plants, the human body or the stars and planets. They wrote down their ideas about what they saw, and based their theories about the world on their observations. During the fourth and fifth centuries the Roman Empire slowly broke down. Many of the Romans' art and sculptures were destroyed and some manuscripts were lost as well. But most importantly, some of the ancient attitudes were lost. A questioning approach to the world was replaced by an unquestioning one. Why did this happen? One reason was to do with the influence of the Christian Church. Through the thousand years following the fall of the Roman Empire, the Church controlled many aspects of life including education and learning. The Church ran all the universities and thought that the aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. The scholars in the universities were expected to study God and heaven from the Bible and ancient books, rather than the world around them. Take medicine for example. The main textbook for doctors had been written by a Greek doctor called Galen more than a thousand years earlier. But when Roger Bacon, a thirteenth-century priest , said that a new approach to medicine was needed --- doctors should do their own original research instead of reading writers from the past such as Galen-the Church put him in prison. By the time of the fourteenth century, however, some parts of the Christian Church were becoming less strict about their ideas and there was a new state of mind among artists, doctors and scientist. People wanted to find out more about... Question: Roger Bacon was put in prison because he _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"challenged the Church\\"?","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"challenged the Church.\\" Roger Bacon was put in prison because he challenged the Church's approach to learning and education. He advocated for a new approach to medicine where doctors should conduct their own original research instead of relying solely on the writings of ancient authors like Galen. This went against the Church's belief that the primary aim of a university should be to teach old ideas more clearly, not to introduce new ones. By suggesting a new approach to medicine and deviating from the established teachings, Roger Bacon was perceived as challenging the authority of the Church, which ultimately led to his imprisonment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] I am facing a new situation today: The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea. Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which of the two areas had more phytoplankton? A:","completion":"Area B Based on the information provided in the background article and the description of the two areas in the Black Sea, it is reasonable to conclude that Area B would have more phytoplankton in comparison to Area A. This conclusion can be drawn based on three main points: water stratification, nutrient mixing, and oxygenation. 1. Water stratification: In Area A, there is a significant presence of water stratification due to the fresh water discharge from the Danube River. As explained in the background article, stratification creates layers of water with distinct properties, such as density, temperature, and salinity, which act as barriers to water mixing. Conversely, Area B has less stratification and a more homogeneous water column. 2. Nutrient mixing: Water stratification acts as a barrier to nutrient mixing between layers, limiting the availability of nutrients in the photic zone (the uppermost layer of water where light penetrates and photosynthesis occurs). Since Area A has higher stratification, it is expected that the nutrient mixing in Area A would be more restricted as opposed to Area B, where water is less stratified and nutrients can move more freely in the water column. 3. Oxygenation: Area B is described as being more oxygenated than Area A. Oxygen is vital for many marine species, including phytoplankton, to survive and thrive. Higher levels of oxygen in Area B would support a more robust and diverse ecosystem, including a greater abundance of phytoplankton. Based on these factors, it can be concluded that Area B, with its less stratified and more oxygenated waters, would provide a more favorable environment for phytoplankton growth and abundance due to the increased nutrient availability and better oxygen conditions. Therefore, Area B is likely to have more phytoplankton than Area A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, what is your weight in newtons? An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon? [Figure 3] Question: \\"When does the force of gravity change\\" Answer: \\"When we change planets\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. The force of gravity changes when we change planets or celestial bodies, such as moons, because each celestial body has a different mass and size, which affects the gravitational force experienced on its surface. To elaborate, let me explain how mass and weight are related, and how gravitational force changes on different celestial bodies: First, let us clarify the difference between mass and weight. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and is constant, regardless of where the object is in the universe. It is typically measured in units of kilograms. Weight, on the other hand, is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and can change depending on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight is commonly measured in newtons (N). The force of gravity pulling an object towards the center of a celestial body depends on both the mass of the object and the mass of the celestial body. The equation to calculate weight is: Weight = Mass × Gravitational Acceleration On Earth, the standard gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.81 m/s². If you have a mass of 50 kg on Earth, your weight can be calculated as follows: Weight = 50 kg × 9.81 m/s² = 490.5 N Now, let us examine the case of an astronaut on the Moon. The gravitational acceleration on the Moon is about 1/6th of that on Earth, which is approximately 1.63 m/s². When the astronaut with a mass of 80 kg on Earth travels to the Moon, his mass will remain the same (80 kg) since the amount of matter in his body does not change. However, his weight on the Moon will be different due to the change in gravitational acceleration. The astronaut's weight on the Moon can be calculated with the same formula: Weight (Moon) = 80 kg × 1.63 m/s² = 130.4 N So, to answer the initial question, the force of gravity (or weight) changes when we move from one celestial body to another with different mass and size, which results in different gravitational accelerations. The example of an astronaut traveling from Earth to the Moon demonstrates how the force of gravity changes when switching planets or celestial bodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(also known as AOL Time Warner from 2001-2003; stylized as TimeWarner) is an American multinational media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in New York City. It is currently the world's third largest entertainment company in terms of revenue, after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company. It was also once the world's largest media conglomerate. Time Warner was first founded in 1990 with the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications (as well as HBO, a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the merger), and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (which was acquired by the company in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount in publishing operations. Among its most popular assets are HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW Television Network, Warner Bros., CNN, DC Comics, and as of August 2016, Hulu, owning 10%. In the past, other major divisions of Time Warner included Time Inc., AOL, Time Warner Cable, Warner Books and Warner Music Group. All of these operations were either sold to other investors or spun off as independent companies from 2004 to 2014. - Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass.

It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world. - Satellite television is according to \\"article 1.39\\" of the International Telecommunication Unions (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR) a \\"Broadcasting-satellite service\\". - Home Box Office (HBO) is an American premium cable and satellite television network that is owned by Time Warner through its respective flagship company Home Box Office, Inc. Programming featured on the network consists primarily of theatrically released motion pictures and original television series, along with made-for-cable movies and documentaries, boxing matches, and occasional stand-up comedy and concert specials. - Sherwin David \\"Wood\\" Harris (born October 17, 1969) is an American actor. He is best known for his roles as the drug kingpin Avon Barksdale on the HBO crime drama \\"The Wire\\", cocaine dealer Ace in \\"Paid in Full\\" and high school football player Julius Campbell in the 2000 film \\"Remember the Titans\\". - Avon Randolph Barksdale is a fictional character in \\"The Wire\\", played by Wood Harris. Avon is one of the more powerful drug dealers in Baltimore, Maryland, running the Barksdale Organization. His Organization territory is based in the heart of west Baltimore's ghetto, solidifying his power in the drug trade. - Opium (poppy tears, with the scientific name: \\"Lachryma papaveris\\") is the dried latex obtained from the opium poppy (scientific name: \\"Papaver somniferum\\"). Opium latex contains approximately 12 percent of the analgesic alkaloid morphine, which is processed chemically to produce heroin and other synthetic opioids for medicinal use and for the illegal drug trade. The latex also contains the closely related opiates codeine and thebaine, and non-analgesic alkaloids such as papaverine and noscapine. The traditional, labor-intensive method of obtaining the latex is to scratch (\\"score\\") the immature seed pods (fruits) by hand; the latex leaks out and dries to a sticky yellowish residue that is later scraped off and dehydrated. The word \\"meconium\\" (derived from the Greek for \\"opium-like\\", but now used to refer to infant stools) historically referred to related, weaker preparations made from other parts of the opium poppy or different species of poppies. - Boxing is a combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring. - Naltrexone is a medication that reverses the effects of opioids and is used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence. - Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung affecting primarily the microscopic air sacs known as alveoli. Typical signs and symptoms include a varying severity and combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and trouble breathing, depending on the underlying cause. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses or bacteria and less commonly by other microorganisms, certain medications and conditions such as autoimmune diseases. Risk factors include other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, and asthma, diabetes, heart failure, a history of smoking, a poor ability to cough such as following a stroke, or a weak immune system. Diagnosis is often based on the symptoms and physical examination. Chest X-ray, blood tests, and culture of the sputum may help confirm the diagnosis. The disease may be classified by where it was acquired with community, hospital, or health care associated pneumonia. Vaccines to prevent certain types of pneumonia are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed to be due to bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low. Pneumonia affects approximately 450 million people globally (7% of the population) and results in about 4 million deaths per year. Pneumonia was regarded by William Osler in the 19th century as \\"the captain of the men of death\\". With the introduction of antibiotics and vaccines in the 20th century, survival improved. Nevertheless, in developing countries, and among the very old, the very young, and the chronically ill, pneumonia remains a leading cause of death. Pneumonia often shortens suffering among those already close to death and has thus been called \\"the old man's friend\\". - Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant \\"Papaver somniferum\\". The psychoactive compounds found in the opium plant include morphine, codeine, and thebaine. The term \\"opiate\\" should be differentiated from the broader term \\"opioid,\\" which includes all drugs with morphine-like effects, including opiates, semi-synthetic opioids derived from opiates (such as heroin, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone), and synthetic opioids which are not derived from opiates (such as fentanyl, buprenorphine, and methadone). All opioids, including the opiates, are considered drugs of high abuse potential and are listed on various \\"Substance-Control Schedules\\" under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the United States. - The Barksdale Organization is a fictional drug dealing gang on the television series \\"The Wire\\". Many of the characters featured in season one of The Wire belong to this organization. Season one largely deals with the Baltimore Police Department setting up a Major Crimes Unit to investigate the organization. The Barksdale Organization is led by Avon Barksdale who is portrayed as the most powerful drug kingpin in Baltimore. - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet. - Melvin Douglas \`\` Little Melvin '' Williams ( December 14 , 1941 -- December 3 , 2015 ) was an American actor and criminal . He was known for trafficking heroin in his native Baltimore , Maryland , in the 1970s and 1980s . He appeared as an actor in the HBO series The Wire , which explores many Baltimore - related subjects , including narcotics trafficking , and served as an inspiration for the character of Avon Barksdale . - Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, or bumping the \\"funny bone\\". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: \\"Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.\\" In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition. - Heroin, also known as diamorphine among other names, is an opiate typically used as a recreational drug for its euphoric effects. Medically it is occasionally used to relieve pain and as a form of opioid replacement therapy alongside counseling. Heroin is typically injected, usually into a vein; however, it can also be smoked, snorted or inhaled. Onset of effects is usually rapid and lasts for a few hours. Common side effects include respiratory depression (decreased breathing) and about a quarter of those who use heroin become physically dependent. Other side effects can include abscesses, infected heart valves, blood borne infections, constipation, and pneumonia. After a history of long-term use, withdrawal symptoms can begin within hours of last use. When given by injection into a vein, heroin has two to three times the effect as a similar dose of morphine. It typically comes as a white or brown powder. Treatment of heroin addiction often includes behavioral therapy and medications. Medications used may include methadone or naltrexone. A heroin overdose may be treated with naloxone. An estimated 17 million people as of 2015 use opiates such as heroin, which together with opioids resulted in 122,000 deaths. The total number of opiate users has increased from 1998 to 2007 after which it has remained more or less stable. In the United States about 1.6 percent of people have used heroin at some point in time. When people die from overdosing on a drug, the drug is usually an opioid. Heroin was first made by C. R. Alder Wright in 1874 from morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Internationally, heroin is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is generally illegal to make, possess, or sell heroin without a license. In 2015 Afghanistan produced about 66% of the world's opium. Often heroin, which is illegally sold, is mixed with other substances such as sugar or strychnine. - David Judah Simon (born February 9, 1960) is an American author, journalist, and a writer/producer of television series.

As noted below, its major effects included updating the Paris Convention of 13 July 1931 to include the vast number of synthetic opioids invented in the intervening thirty years and a mechanism for more easily including new ones. From 1931 to 1961, most of the families of synthetic opioids had been developed, including drugs in whatever way related to methadone, pethidine, morphinans and dextromoramide and related drugs; research on fentanyls and piritramide was also nearing fruition at that point. - The verb license or grant license means to give permission. The noun licence (British, Indian, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish, or South African English) or license (American English) refers to that permission as well as to the document recording that permission. - Opioids are substances that act on opioid receptors to produce morphine-like effects. Opioids are most often used medically to relieve pain, and by people addicted to opioids. Opioids include , an older term that refers to such drugs derived from , including morphine itself. Other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. The terms and are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. , derived from words meaning or , as an American legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials; it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. In other jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as \\"narcotics\\". The term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged where that is the case. Primarily used for pain relief, including anesthesia they are also used to suppress cough, suppress diarrhea, treat addiction, reverse opioid overdose, and suppress opioid induced constipation. Extremely strong opioids are approved only for veterinary use such as immobilizing large mammals. Opioids act by binding to opioid receptors, which are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. These receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. Opioid drugs include partial agonists and antagonists, which produce moderate or no effect (respectively) but displace other opioids from binding in those receptors. The side effects of opioids may include itchiness, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. Tolerance and dependence will develop with continuous use, requiring increasing doses and leading to a withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt discontinuation. The euphoria attracts recreational use, and...

In their first home game in nearly a month, the Patriots faced the Broncos, winners of 16 of the last 19 games between the two teams, on Monday Night Football; earlier that day, the Patriots placed Maroney on injured reserve with a shoulder injury after he had missed two of the team's last three games, and activated offensive lineman Stephen Neal from the physically unable to perform list. After winning the coin toss, the Patriots deferred their pick to the start of the second half; the Broncos elected to receive. On the opening series, Broncos quarterback Jay Cutler injured his finger on the first play, but led the Broncos into Patriots territory, where running back Andre Hall, who replaced injured starter Michael Pittman two plays prior, fumbled at the Patriots' 30-yard line; Patriots defensive lineman Le Kevin Smith's recovery gave the Patriots the ball at their own 32-yard line to begin their first drive. A 29-yard reception by Watson brought the Patriots into the Broncos' red zone, where the drive ended and a 31-yard Gostkowski field goal gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. On the fourth play of the Broncos' ensuing drive, Hall fumbled again; this time, a scramble for the ball pushed it 25 yards in the Patriots' favor to the Broncos' 37-yard line, where Mayo recovered it. A Broncos unnecessary roughness penalty on the play gave the ball to the Patriots at the Broncos' 22-yard line, but after failing to make a first down, a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal extended the Patriots' lead to 6-0. An exchange of three punts brought the game into the second quarter, where Morris ran for 34 yards on the second play of a Patriots drive to put them in the Broncos' red zone yet again. Four plays later, on 4th-and-1 from the Broncos' 4-yard line, Morris ran for a 4-yard touchdown that gave the Patriots a 13-0 lead. The Broncos' next drive ended with Meriweather intercepting a deep throw by Cutler, setting up the Patriots' next series at their own 16-yard line. After a sack of Cassel put the Patriots even deeper into their own territory, a facemask penalty on Cassel on third down by Broncos linebacker Jamie Winborn gave the Patriots a new set of downs. Five plays later, on another 4th-and-1, Morris ran for 29 yards to give the Patriots a first down from the Broncos' 13-yard line; he ran for a total of 138 yards on 16 carries. On the next play, Moss caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to extend the Patriots' lead to 20-0. The Broncos' next drive began with backup Patrick Ramsey replacing Cutler at quarterback. On the fourth play, defensive lineman Mike Wright sacked Ramsey and forced a fumble, which undrafted free agent linebacker Gary Guyton caught to give the Patriots the ball at midfield. Cassel suffered his fifth sack on the next play, the final of the first half. The Patriots chose to receive the ball to open the second half. Another undrafted rookie, running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis, elevated from the Patriots' practice squad before the Chargers game, replaced Morris, who left the game with a knee injury. A Patriots punt was followed by a Broncos three-and-out; Welker returned the punt 44 yards to give the Patriots the ball at the Broncos' 28-yard line. After two Green-Ellis carries gained one yard, Cassel used a screen play to throw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Moss to extend the Patriots' lead to 27-0. Three completed passes and an unnecessary roughness penalty on Patriots defensive lineman Vince Wilfork moved the Broncos' next drive into Patriots' territory before the Broncos turned the ball over for the fifth and final time, with safety James Sanders intercepting a Cutler pass; a second unnecessary roughness call, originally on Wilfork but later changed to be on Sanders, gave the Patriots the ball at their own 20-yard line to begin the ensuing drive. Three plays after a 27-yard Welker catch put the Patriots in Broncos territory, Broncos safety Calvin Lowry appeared to have intercepted an errant Cassel throw at the Broncos' 1-yard line, but, when the Patriots challenged, the pass was deemed incomplete, as the ball touched the ground before Lowry had possession. Two plays later, Welker caught his first touchdown pass of the season, this one from 6 yards out, to give the Patriots a 34-0 lead. Four plays later, former Patriots tight end Daniel Graham caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Cutler to cut the Patriots' lead to 34-7. The Patriots' next drive got as far as the Broncos' 33-yard line but eventually ended in a punt. The Broncos, facing 3rd-and-21 on their next drive, had a 21-yard completion by Cutler pushed back by a Broncos holding penalty; Richard Seymour sacked Cutler on the next play, forcing the Broncos to punt on 4th-and-23 with 6:35 left in the game. On the ensuing Patriots drive, two 10-yard runs by Green-Ellis and 16- and 15-yard runs by Faulk put the Patriots in the red zone, where Green-Ellis earned his first NFL touchdown, running in untouched from the 1-yard line, to score the final points of the game. Another Broncos punt gave the Patriots the ball to end the game with a 41-7 victory that took the Patriots' record to 4-2. The Patriots accumulated 257 rushing yards, their largest total since the 1985 season. Cassel, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 185 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions, finished with a passer rating of 136.3, one of the ten highest single-game ratings in Patriots history, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. On the final play of the third quarter, as the Broncos were driving into Patriots territory, Harrison was injured while attempting to tackle Cutler. Harrison, whose 2005 and 2006 seasons were cut short by knee injuries that caused ligament damage, suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in his right leg. Harrison was carted off the field and placed on injured reserve two days later. Safety Antwain Spann was then activated from the practice squad. The Broncos also lost players to injury: Ramsey and linebacker Boss Bailey were also placed on injured reserve, while cornerback Champ Bailey was sidelined for several weeks by a torn groin muscle.

Background: Bure was born in Moscow in 1971 to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. At age 12, his parents separated, and he remained with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school at the age of six, despite his limited skating ability. Context: The New York Rangers acquired Bure on March 18, 2002, along with Florida's second-round pick in the 2002 draft (Lee Falardeau) for Igor Ulanov, Filip Novak, as well as the Rangers' first and second-round choices in the 2002 draft (Petr Taticek and Rob Globke, respectively) and a fourth-round choice in the 2003 draft. The Rangers had shown interest in Bure when he requested a trade from the Canucks in 1997. After losing their initial bid for Bure, Wayne Gretzky, who retired the same season Bure was dealt to Florida, announced prior to the 1999-2000 season he would have extended his career had the Rangers been able to pull off the trade. Bure made his Rangers debut against the Vancouver Canucks the day after his trade on March 19, scoring a goal against his former team. He scored 12 goals and 20 points in 12 games after being traded, bettering his pace with Florida that season. Between the two teams, he finished the season with 34 goals and 69 points. Bure suffered another knee injury in the 2002-03 pre-season; combined with a case of strep throat, he missed the first three games of the regular season. After returning to play, he had 14 goals and 21 points in his first 27 games, including two goals and an assist in his first game back, before a knee-on-knee collision in December forced him back out. After undergoing surgery 10 days later, it was revealed that there was no damage to the ACL as previously feared, but instead a tear to the meniscus in his left knee, which was repaired. Bure returned that season to appear in 39 games, managing 19 goals and 30 points. Even after two operations, Bure did not play in 2003-04 due to the lingering effects of the knee injury. He failed a pre-season physical and was declared medically unable to play. Left with his fully insured 10 million salary (80 percent of which would be reimbursed to the team), the Rangers left him unprotected in the NHL's Waiver Draft, where he was unclaimed. Question: who was he traded from before the new york rangers. Whats the answer?","completion":"Pavel Bure was traded from the Florida Panthers before joining the New York Rangers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Debbie Barker has been jailed for three years over the late-night crash which killed hotelier Tom Bannister as they drove home from his Coniston Hotel near Skipton, North Yorkshire. Police found Barker, 43, lying in a field in her nightdress four hours after she lost control of her Range Rover and hit a wall, a court heard. She was still over the drink-drive limit. Killed: Debbie Barker (left) has been jailed for three years after she crashed while over the drink drive limit in a country lane, killing Tom Bannister (right) as she gave him a lift home his hotel near Skipton, North Yorkshire. Event: The pair had left the Coniston Hotel near Skipton, North Yorkshire, which Mr Bannister's family owned. Bradford Crown Court heard Mr Bannister, 48, had accepted a lift with Barker after an event at the hotel his family owned on June 22 last year. As she wound through the Yorkshire Dales National Park near the village of Bell Busk, where he lived, the car rolled on a moderate bend and hit a wall, coming to rest in a field. Father-of-one Mr Bannister was thrown from the car while Barker survived, concussed and unable to remember the car leaving the road. She later told police that she did not have her phone, so she went to her friend's nearby home to raise help. Sentence: Barker arriving at Bradford Crown Court yesterday, where she was jailed for three years. Ian Howard, prosecuting, said she was unable to gain a response so she then walked across fields to reach her own house. But instead of phoning 999 she phoned Mr Bannister’s father, Michael, who went outside and found his son showing no signs of life. An ambulance finally arrived at 2.57am and the victim, who suffered severe head injuries, was pronounced dead at the scene. Half an hour later officers visited Barker's home, but saw she was not there and two mobile phones were on the kitchen table. After a short search, they found her in a field just yards from her home at 4.09am. Several breath tests revealed Barker was over the drink drive limit. Police estimated she was at around twice the legal limit at the time of the accident, believed to have been around midnight. Mr Howard said the call to Michael Bannister was 'probably made about two hours after the accident had taken place'. Barker pleaded guilty to two charges - causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed limit, and failing to report an accident. Prosecutors argued Barker knew she was over the legal limit and wanted to delay being tested. Malcolm Swift QC, defending, said the case was instead one of a 'ridiculous and stupid error'. He told the court: 'She was briefly concussed for a short period of time after the accident and had no recollection of the car leaving the road. 'She was lying down in the field about 20ft from the house (when she was found). She says she didn’t know how she came to be in the that position but she came round when she heard voices.' But Recorder of Bradford Judge Roger Thomas QC said Barker had done everything 'to keep herself out of the way and avoid detection'. He added: 'The only sensible reason is she was trying to lie low and avoid the situation'. The judge told her: 'You must have been significantly over the prescribed limit for driving. 'You failed to negotiate a fairly moderate bend in the road, going straight on a hitting a wall. It must have been apparent to you he was very badly injured.' The court heard the Barkers and the Bannisters were friends, and Mr Bannister’s family had supported Barker after the accident. Traffic Constable Andy Macleod, of North Yorkshire Police’s Roads Policing Group, said: 'Barker showed a callous disregard for Mr Bannister’s welfare when she left the scene of the collision. Isolated: Police said the crash was in a country lane (pictured) between the villages of Airton and Bell Busk. Businessman: Police said hotelier Mr Bannister was a popular member of the community and his family was on good terms with Barker's. His relatives remained supportive towards her after the accident, the court heard. 'The sentence reflects the gravity of the offences she committed and how seriously all agencies in the criminal justice system view them.' Gerry Wareham, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor for Yorkshire and Humberside, added: 'By getting behind the wheel of her vehicle after she had been drinking she took a huge and irresponsible risk and, very sadly, Mr Bannister paid for it with his life. 'She then neglected to alert emergency services as soon as practicable and it was several hours after the accident before any potential help arrived. 'Thomas Bannister was very well-known and much-loved in the local community. He was a father, a son and a friend to many and will be sorely missed. 'This terrible case has resulted in the loss of his life and devastated that of many others. I hope it serves as a stark warning of the potentially tragic consequences of drinking and driving.' Barker, of Gargrave, North Yorkshire, was jailed for three years and banned from driving for five years.

Given the following context: A show composed of a concert, circus acts, and broadway is taking place at a theater in the city. One of the stars of the show is a lady cat dancer whom Oswald suddenly has affection for upon seeing a poster. For admission, patrons have to pay 50 cents. Unfortunately for Oswald, his pockets are empty. Oswald notices a stage entrance where performers and certain officials can come in, and admission is unnecessary. Because of this, Oswald comes up with an idea of impersonating a performer by bulging his chest (possibly pretending to be a stuntman). The guard by the door isn't deceived and prevents the penniless rabbit from coming in. After a bit of a struggle, Oswald ties the guard to a lamp post and proceeds toward the inside of the theater. However, he is forced back outside by the glaring performers. While thinking of a way to get back in, Oswald sees a man in a thick fur coat coming out of a taxi and heading towards the theater entrance. Oswald hides under the man's shadow. As the man with the coat enters, the guard becomes suspicious upon noticing a lump on the shadow. Thinking he made it inside undetected, Oswald comes out but doesn't notice the guard approaching him. When he realizes the guard was right behind him, Oswald quickly makes his move. Oswald prevails in losing the guard by going inside a cage. However, he is met with more trouble when the cage contains a jaguar. The jaguar chases him into the stage where acrobats are doing a balancing act with a long pole. Oswald climbs up the pole and grabs the ceiling for his safety. One of the acrobats also goes up the pole and clings onto the rabbit's legs. Bothered by having someone hanging under him, Oswald grabs a mallet and strikes off the acrobat. Oswald plunges down and drops on the jaguar.

Paragraph: Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history. Question: \\"Who was forced to flee after he raised taxes and civil disturbances broke out?\\" Answer: \\"Louis\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"Louis\\" is correct.

Paragraph: Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" Question: \\"What kind of grades has Malaysia received concerning its handling of the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" Answer: \\"It has passed\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer is not correct.

The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut Context: David Byrne, Chris Frantz, and Tina Weymouth were alumni of the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island. There, Byrne and Frantz formed a band called \\"The Artistics\\" in 1973. Weymouth was Frantz's girlfriend and often provided transportation for the band. The Artistics dissolved the following year, and the three moved to New York, eventually sharing a communal loft. Unable to find a bass player in New York City, Frantz encouraged Weymouth to learn to play bass by listening to Suzi Quatro albums. They played their first gig as \\"Talking Heads\\" opening for the Ramones at CBGB on June 5, 1975. In a later interview, Weymouth recalled how the group chose the name Talking Heads: \\"A friend had found the name in the TV Guide, which explained the term used by TV studios to describe a head-and-shoulder shot of a person talking as 'all content, no action'. It fit.\\" Later that year, the trio recorded a series of demos for CBS, but the band was not signed to the label. They quickly drew a following and were signed to Sire Records in November 1976. The group released their first single in February that year, \\"Love - Building on Fire\\". In March 1977, they added Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), formerly of Jonathan Richman's band The Modern Lovers. Their first album was released soon afterwards, Talking Heads: 77, which did not contain the earlier single. The album received considerable acclaim and spawned what became the group's first charted single, \\"Psycho Killer\\". The song was released to the radio just months after the serial killer known as the Son of Sam had been terrorizing New York City, prompting many to assume some eerie connection. However, it was later revealed that Byrne had written the song nearly four years earlier. Question: When did the band form?.

Sources say he was not prepared to be dictated to by the teams, so he did not present that option when the decision to change was put to a vote of the F1 Commission, which includes all teams, the FIA, F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone and representatives of the circuits, sponsors and tyre suppliers. Instead, Todt offered the choice of a slightly amended elimination format - with the first two sessions slightly extended and only the third session running as 2015 - or to stick with the new rules. McLaren, Red Bull, Toro Rosso and Force India all voted against the tweaks because it was not what had been agreed by the teams in Australia. Insiders say by doing so they hoped to force Todt to run a second vote with the option of reverting to 2015's format but this did not happen. Several drivers made the point that the fiasco underlined their reasons for writing an open letter last week pleading for F1's governance to be changed to stop decisions being made on the sport's future. Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel, a director of the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, said he hoped the letter would lead to a \\"re-think of what is currently happening\\". He added: \\"Obviously it is clear if you write the letter it doesn't change tomorrow, we didn't give any proposals, we just made clear something is not right and something has to change. our intention was to really question our current situation and decision-making and hopefully improve that in the future.\\" Hamilton is one of a handful of drivers who are not members of the GPDA but he said the drivers were unanimously behind the letter. Media playback is not supported on this device McLaren driver Jenson Button, also a GPDA director, said: \\"We wrote it to show we care. \\"We're very passionate about the sport. We grew up loving watching F1 and dreaming of being in an F1 car and racing against the best drivers in the world. \\"We are very emotional about our decisions, which sometimes is not the best, but you do need emotion about the way a sport should work and our input could be very useful. \\"We're not putting a statement out to show how strong we are as drivers.

Complete the following sentence. Lindsey understood chemistry more than Victoria so","completion":"Lindsey understood chemistry more than Victoria so she naturally became the go-to tutor and mentor for her peers in their high school chemistry class. Due to her innate ability to comprehend complex chemical concepts, Lindsey was able to effortlessly break them down into simpler, more easily digestible pieces for her classmates, including Victoria. It was evident that Lindsey had a genuine passion for chemistry. She spent hours poring over her textbooks, perfecting her understanding of the periodic table, and experimenting with various chemical reactions. This dedication to study extended to her willingness to help her peers, as she demonstrated incredible patience and enthusiasm in assisting those who struggled with the subject. She would also stay after school to set up chemistry labs for her fellow students to come and explore hands-on learning. While Victoria was also interested in chemistry, she found it rather challenging to grasp some of the more advanced concepts, such as stoichiometry and chemical equilibrium. However, she was determined to improve her understanding and excel in the subject. She appreciated the tenacity and intellect that Lindsey displayed and admired her willingness to help others. Victoria knew that by learning from Lindsey, she could bolster her chemistry knowledge and, perhaps in due time, conquer her difficulties in the subject area. Their high school instructor quickly recognized the exceptional relationship between Lindsey and Victoria and the positive impact they had on their classmates. As a result, the teacher provided additional support to Lindsey by giving her access to extra resources and lab equipment, knowing that her contributions would benefit the entire class. He encouraged Lindsey to lead study sessions and group projects, creating an inviting and inclusive atmosphere where everyone could thrive, with Victoria taking on a more active role as she continued to learn from Lindsey. As the school year progressed, Lindsey played a pivotal role in not only Victoria's academic success but also that of many of their classmates. They would often work together as a team, with Victoria bringing challenging problems that she faced to Lindsey, who would then investigate and break down the concepts in a manner that Victoria and others could understand. As Victoria's knowledge grew, so did her confidence, and she soon found herself excelling in areas of chemistry that she had once found daunting. This collaboration between Lindsey and Victoria fostered a heightened sense of camaraderie and mutual respect among their classmates. As the semester went on, the entire chemistry class noticed a significant improvement in overall performance and enthusiasm for the subject matter. This renewed excitement for learning chemistry extended beyond the classroom as well, generating discussions and debates about the real-world applications of chemistry in everyday life. Ultimately, Lindsey's superior understanding of chemistry not only cemented her position as a skilled and empathetic mentor for her classmates like Victoria, but it also served as a catalyst for an entire group of students to discover the joy of learning, the power of collaboration, and the importance of perseverance in the face of academic challenges. This inspiring story speaks to the transformative influence that one person with a passion for a subject can have on others around them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Variation in plumage also allows for the identification of birds, particularly between species. Visual communication among birds may also involve ritualised displays, which have developed from non-signalling actions such as preening, the adjustments of feather position, pecking, or other behaviour. These displays may signal aggression or submission or may contribute to the formation of pair-bonds.

Kindergartners at PS 90 in Coney Island will not be allowed to sing “God Bless the USA” at graduation on June 20, after their principal, Greta Hawkins, proclaimed that “we don’t want to offend other cultures,” according to the teachers who witnessed it. But “Baby” by Justin Bieber remains on the program. A spokeswoman for the Department of Education told the New York Post that the lyrics of “God Bless the USA” were “not age-appropriate.” First off, the point of a patriotic song is not to avoid offending other cultures. Consider the lyrics of, well, every national anthem ever written. The French sing, loosely translated by Marseillaise.org, “Listen to the sound in the fields/The howling of these fearsome soldiers/They are coming into our midst/To cut the throats of your sons and consorts/To arms citizens/ Form your battalions/March, march/Let impure blood/Water our furrows!” The lyrics of “God Bless the USA” are not only age-appropriate, they involve very little watering of furrows with blood. And even if they did, it would still be a better song. “Baby,” meanwhile, runs as follows: “Baby, baby, baby, ooh. Baby, baby, baby, ooh. Baby, baby, baby, ooh — ” Well, you get the idea. There are also other lyrics in there about “She knows she got me dazing ‘cause she was so amazing.” These are not age-appropriate either: They are an insult to the intelligence of any self-respecting kindergartner. Not only that, but he’s Canadian.","completion":"Title: \\"Cultural Sensitivity or Misguided Priorities? The Controversial Song Selection for PS 90 Kindergarten Graduation\\" In an effort to avoid offending other cultures, PS 90 in Coney Island has placed a ban on the inclusion of the patriotic song \\"God Bless the USA\\" at their kindergarten graduation ceremony on June 20. This decision, made by Principal Greta Hawkins, has stirred a wave of controversy as it was witnessed by several teachers. According to a Department of Education spokesperson, the exclusion of the song comes on the basis that the lyrics are \\"not age-appropriate.\\" Conversely, Justin Bieber's \\"Baby\\" is still permitted to feature on the program. The intended purpose of a patriotic song is to instill a feeling of pride within those who share a common nationality, not to purposefully cause offense to those of differing cultural backgrounds. Various national anthems throughout the world often contain strong, emotive language, highlighting the nature of their patriotic themes. The lyrics of \\"God Bless the USA,\\" in comparison, are relatively mild and age-appropriate, focusing more on instilling pride rather than violent imagery. Despite the exclusion of \\"God Bless the USA,\\" the inclusion of Justin Bieber's \\"Baby\\" raises its own concerns as its lyrics can be interpreted as inappropriate for young children as well, containing lyrics that could be seen as an insult to their intelligence. Furthermore, the fact that Justin Bieber is Canadian adds an additional layer of controversy as the school opts to feature a non-American artist rather than a patriotic American song in their program. This decision by PS 90 raises questions about the balance between embracing cultural sensitivity and retaining a sense of national pride, as well as the appropriateness of songs chosen for events involving young children. One must ask if the decision to exclude \\"God Bless the USA\\" on the grounds of not wanting to offend other cultures sends a message that prioritizes this goal over instilling a sense of pride in the nation's young citizens. Additionally, it begs the question of whether a suitable alternative could have been selected instead, one that honored the school's stance on cultural sensitivity while still fostering a connection to patriotism and the American spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: According to Greek mythology, Penelope was whose faithful wife?","completion":"In Greek mythology, Penelope was the faithful wife of the legendary hero Odysseus. Odysseus, also known by his Latin name Ulysses, was the King of Ithaca, an island in the Ionian Sea. He played a crucial role in Greek mythology, especially as one of the central characters in Homer's epic poem, the Odyssey, which narrates his adventurous and arduous ten-year journey back home after the fall of Troy. Penelope, the daughter of Icarius of Sparta and the nymph Periboea, was highly admired in the ancient world for her virtue, wisdom, and loyalty. She was also the cousin of the renowned Helen of Troy, who played a pivotal role in the famous Trojan War by causing the conflict between the Greeks and Trojans. When Odysseus set off to participate in the Trojan War, Penelope was left behind to manage their kingdom and protect their young son, Telemachus. Despite being separated from her husband for 20 long years, Penelope never wavered in her loyalty to him, remaining steadfastly devoted to him throughout the duration of his absence. During Odysseus' absence, Penelope received numerous suitors who hoped to win her hand in marriage and take over the kingdom of Ithaca. These suitors, recognizing that Odysseus might never return, were increasingly insistent in their pursuit of Penelope. However, Penelope was able to artfully avoid choosing a suitor by employing a clever ruse. She declared that she would make her decision only after she had completed the weaving of a burial shroud for her father-in-law, Laertes. In an incredible display of cunning and wisdom, Penelope weaved the shroud during the day and secretly unraveled her work at night. In this way, she managed to stall her decision for several years, maintaining her fidelity to Odysseus. When Odysseus finally returned to Ithaca, he arrived in secret at first, disguised as a beggar. His identity unknown to almost everyone, including Penelope, he began to systematically eliminate the multitude of suitors who had been pursuing his wife. Ultimately, Penelope devised a challenge for the suitors to determine the true identity of her husband – stringing Odysseus' famous bow and shooting an arrow through a line of small rings. Only Odysseus, with his great strength and skill, could accomplish this seemingly impossible task. With the suitors recognized and defeated, Odysseus finally revealed himself to Penelope, and the two were joyfully reunited. Their love and fidelity, tested by the many years of separation and adversity, remained unwavering – a testament to the virtues of loyalty, patience, and resourcefulness. Penelope's devotion to her husband has made her an iconic symbol of marital fidelity and a model of the ideal wife in literature and art throughout history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are many crows and hyenas roving around the bodies. The priest reaches the dead body of another priest and tries take a small demon idol of the head of Pazuzu from his hand, but, suddenly, the dead priest briefly comes back to life and stops the living priest from taking it.

He is haunted especially by an incident in a small village in the occupied Netherlands during World War II, where he served as parish priest: near the end of the war, a sadistic Nazi SS commander, in retaliation for the murder of a German trooper, forces Merrin to participate in arbitrary executions in order to save a full village from slaughter. After World War II, Merrin is an archaeologist in Cairo, when he is approached by a collector of antiquities named Semelier who asks him to come to a British excavation in a valley called Derati the Turkana region of Kenya. This dig is excavating a Christian Byzantine church built circa 500 A.D. â long before Christianity had reached that region of Africa. Semelier asks Merrin to recover an ancient relic of a demon, thought to be in the church, before the British can find it. The relic is the small head of the Pazuzu idol. Merrin agrees and travels to the dig site. He is joined by Father Francis, a Vatican... My question: What did Father Lankester Merrin serve as in World War II?

As a teenager, he was greatly troubled by the Metaphysics of Aristotle, which he could not understand until he read al-Farabi's commentary on the work. For the next year and a half, he studied philosophy, in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled inquiry, he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then go to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties. Deep into the night, he would continue his studies, and even in his dreams problems would pursue him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through the Metaphysics of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found illumination, from the little commentary by Farabi, which he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhams. So great was his joy at the discovery, made with the help of a work from which he had expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and bestowed alms upon the poor.

These curses are illegal in the wizarding world, and their use is strictly prohibited and punishable by imprisonment in Azkaban, the maximum-security wizarding prison. 1. Avada Kedavra (Killing Curse): The first and most feared of the Unforgivable Curses is the Avada Kedavra, also known as the Killing Curse. When cast successfully, this spell causes instant and painless death to the victim. No counter-curse or shield can block the effects of Avada Kedavra, except for sacrificial protection, as demonstrated by Lily Potter's protection of her son, Harry. The only known survivor of the Killing Curse is Harry Potter, who, due to his mother's sacrifice, was left with a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead after Lord Voldemort unsuccessfully attempted to kill him. 2. Imperius Curse (Imperio): The second of the Unforgivable Curses is the Imperius Curse. When cast, it gives the caster complete and total control over the victim, allowing them to command the individual and bend their will to fulfill their own desires. The victim becomes a puppet or slave to the caster, carrying out any order, no matter how immoral or dangerous. Some strong-willed individuals, like Harry Potter and Barty Crouch Jr., have shown the ability to resist the effects of the Imperius Curse, but for others, resisting has proven to be quite challenging. 3. Cruciatus Curse (Crucio): The third Unforgivable Curse is the Cruciatus Curse. This particularly cruel and painful spell inflicts unbearable pain and suffering upon its victim. Often referred to as \\"torture,\\" the Cruciatus Curse is frequently utilized by dark witches and wizards to punish and interrogate their enemies. As the intensity and duration of the curse increase, the victim may become both physically and mentally damaged. Prolonged exposure to the curse, as experienced by characters like Frank and Alice Longbottom, can lead to permanent insanity or disability. In the Harry Potter series, the Unforgivable Curses represent the darkest and most dangerous aspects of magical power. Their use highlights the thin line between good and evil and serves to emphasize the importance of choice and morality in the wizarding world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Determine your goal(s) and objectives. Consider ordering your work plan by \\"SMART\\" objectives. List your resources. Identify any constraints. Who is accountable. Write your strategy.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Creating an Effective Work Plan: An In-Depth Guide to Achieving Success in Project Management Introduction In an increasingly competitive and fast-paced work environment, effective project management has become an absolute necessity for organizations to scale and adapt to growing demands. A work plan serves as the core of any project, providing a clear roadmap to success in meeting goals and objectives. This article is designed to guide you through the process of developing an efficient work plan by outlining its key components with a focus on incorporating \\"SMART\\" objectives. We will further explore how to efficiently allocate resources, overcome constraints, and ensure seamless accountability for all stakeholders. Background A work plan is a written document that outlines the steps, resources, and timeframes required to complete a project. It is a crucial element in project management, as it helps in setting expectations, managing risks, coordinating teams, and measuring progress. With proven benefits such as increased productivity, maximized resource utilization, and improved communication, work plans are now a fundamental aspect of not just businesses but also nonprofits and governmental organizations. Determine Your Goal(s) and Objectives Identifying clear and measurable goals and objectives is the first step in creating an effective work plan. Goals are high-level, broad statements that define the desired outcome of the project, while objectives are more specific and concrete statements that outline the necessary actions required to achieve the said goals. It is essential to keep your goals in line with your organization's vision and mission, ensuring the project aligns with your strategic direction. Consider Ordering your Work Plan by \\"SMART\\" Objectives To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of your work plan, it is crucial to incorporate \\"SMART\\" objectives. \\"SMART\\" is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. By using the SMART criteria, you can ensure your objectives are clear, actionable, and trackable, leading to better overall project outcomes. Here is a brief description of each criterion: 1. Specific: The objective should be clearly defined and easy to understand, focusing on only one aspect of the project. 2. Measurable: The objective should be quantifiable, allowing you to track performance and measure progress. 3. Achievable: The objective should be realistic and within the team's capabilities. 4. Relevant: The objective should be aligned with the overarching goals and the overall success of the project. 5. Time-bound: The objective should have a defined time frame to encourage prompt action and establish a sense of urgency. List Your Resources An essential aspect of an efficient work plan is the comprehensive listing and allocation of resources. Resources encompass the tools, equipment, materials, personnel, and finances required to accomplish your objectives. Accurate resource estimation ensures smooth project execution, minimizes potential bottlenecks, and helps stakeholders make informed decisions. Documenting and regularly updating your resource list enables efficient tracking, control, and optimization. Identify Any Constraints Recognizing and addressing potential constraints is crucial in the development of a comprehensive work plan. Constraints can range from limited budgets and tight schedules to inadequate skillsets within the team or competing priorities. Identifying these challenges early on enables you to adapt your work plan and ensures timely mitigation, thereby reducing the risks of project delays or failures. Who is Accountable? Establishing clear roles and responsibilities for all team members is a vital aspect of effective work plan implementation. Each team member should have a clear understanding of their tasks, competencies, and reporting lines. Additionally, assigning an accountable project manager ensures effective project oversight and reduces uncertainties and confusion. Regular communication of expectations and progress further promotes a culture of accountability and drives team performance. Write Your Strategy The final step in creating an effective work plan is outlining your strategy. This encompasses the series of actions and approaches that will be taken to achieve your objectives and goals. Your strategy should describe the critical milestones, key activities, and potential risks and mitigation measures. Developing a well-structured and easily comprehensible strategy ensures your work plan remains focused, cohesive, and easy to follow for all stakeholders. Conclusion An effective work plan is the cornerstone of successful project management. By following the steps outlined in this article, including adopting SMART objectives, allocating resources, identifying constraints, and promoting accountability, you will be well on your way to unlocking your project's full potential. A comprehensive and well-executed work plan not only maximizes efficiency and minimizes risks but also allows your organization to build a strong foundation for sustained growth and success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which river had a food source mostly derived from algae? Hint: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.","completion":"The Mures river, which is slow-moving and deep, likely had a food source mostly derived from algae.

Amphipods are a type of crustacean that includes more than 10,000 known species found in various aquatic habitats, such as oceans, lakes, and wetlands. These small and inconspicuous creatures are essential in the marine food chain, acting as a critical food source for larger organisms including fish and birds. Typically, anisogammarids inhabit shallow waters and are known for their excellent adaptation to different environments, including fresh to slightly brackish water conditions. As benthic organisms, they dwell at the bottom of bodies of water, where they contribute to ecosystems as scavengers and decomposers of plant and animal matter. Consequently, this maintains water quality and ensures the health of their habitats. The family Anisogammaridae includes several genera, which represent further sub-classifications of these animals based on shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships. Through studying these diverse amphipods, researchers can better understand their ecological roles and the broader marine ecosystems in which they play a part. In summary, the text provides information about a specific family of marine animals, Anisogammaridae, that comprises small benthic amphipods found in the northern part of the Pacific rim. Thus, the most suitable category for this text is \\"animal.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The audience members jumped in their seats, caught off guard by the sudden increase in volume. Realizing his mistake, John quickly switched off the megaphone and searched for the microphone. Step 1: Describe the consequence of John's mistake. Justification: It's important to illustrate the outcome of using the megaphone, so the reader can understand the situation and the reaction of the audience. As he picked up the microphone, he sheepishly apologized to the stunned audience. \\"Sorry about that, folks,\\" he said, trying to lighten the atmosphere with a sheepish grin. He successfully caught their attention, but now needed to win back their trust. Step 2: Show John's reaction and attempt to remedy the situation. Justification: The reader needs to see John's response to his mistake and how he tries to regain control of the situation. John took a deep breath and began his speech again, this time using the microphone. His voice was clear and at a comfortable volume. He spoke passionately about the importance of community engagement and their local environment.

See the multi-choice question below: Sentence 1: Keeping Tabs would never presume to speak for Ms. Sentence 2: Keeping Tabs isn't speaking on her behalf. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? OPTIONS: a. yes. b. it is not possible to tell. c. no.","completion":"The answer to this question is a. yes. To fully understand the reasoning behind this answer, let's break down each sentence separately and then examine them together. Sentence 1: Keeping Tabs would never presume to speak for Ms. This sentence informs us that Keeping Tabs (presumably an entity or individual) does not have the intention or believes it has the authority to speak for \\"Ms.\\" Here, \\"not presume\\" suggests an active avoidance in engaging in any activity that may involve speaking on behalf of Ms. Sentence 2: Keeping Tabs isn't speaking on her behalf. This sentence is a present tense affirmation of the idea that Keeping Tabs is not speaking for the aforementioned \\"Ms.\\" The use of \\"isn't\\" is a contraction of \\"is not,\\" which means that Keeping Tabs is currently not engaging in the act of speaking on her behalf. Now, let's examine these sentences together to determine if the second sentence can be true, assuming the first sentence is true. If Keeping Tabs would never presume to speak for Ms. (as true in Sentence 1), then it means that at any given moment, Keeping Tabs is not speaking on her behalf. This aligns perfectly with the statement in Sentence 2 that Keeping Tabs isn't speaking on her behalf.

Tekstiilituotteiden merkintöjen uudet säännöt ovat olennaisia, jotta voidaan estää ne ongelmat, jotka syntyvät silloin, kun kuluttajille ei tarjota riittävästi tietoa tuotteista. Tämän vuoksi lainsäädäntöä on päivitetty ja uudet säännöt astuneet voimaan. Uudet säännökset kattavat erilaiset tekstiilikiuista valmistetut tuotteet, kuten vaatteet, kodin tekstiilit, jalkineet ja asusteet. Näiden tekstiilituotteiden raaka-aineiden alkuperä sekä valmistustiedot tulee esittää selvästi tuotteen merkinnöissä. Tämä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi, että tuotteen valmistuksessa käytettyjen kuitujen osuudet on ilmoitettava prosenttiosuuksina ja tuotteen valmistusmaan tulee olla selkeästi esillä. Näiden tietojen avulla kuluttajat voivat tehdä paremmin informoituja ostopäätöksiä ja välttää mahdollisten allergioiden, ihon ärsytyksen tai muiden haitallisten terveysvaikutusten aiheuttamat ongelmat, jotka voivat johtua esimerkiksi kuitujen laadusta, kemikaalien käytöstä tai eettisistä kysymyksistä, kuten lasten työvoiman käytöstä. Lisäksi tämä auttaa kuluttajia tunnistamaan eettisemmät ja ympäristöystävällisemmät vaihtoehdot ja ohjaa heitä suosimaan tällaisia tuotteita. Uusien sääntöjen avulla pyritään myös estämään harhaanjohtavia markkinointikäytäntöjä, jotka voivat vahingoittaa kuluttajien luottamusta ja aiheuttaa kilpailuvääristymiä markkinoilla. Tämä käsittää esimerkiksi tekstiilituotteiden väittämien, kuten \\"ympäristöystävällinen\\" tai \\"eettisesti valmistettu\\", perusteellisen valvonnan, jotta voidaan varmistaa, että tällaiset merkinnät ovat perusteltuja ja luotettavia. Merkintöjen selkeys ja tarkkuus auttavat paitsi kuluttajia myös yrityksiä, sillä ne edistävät reilun ja avoimen kilpailun puitteita tekstiilialalla. Lisäksi ne edistävät innovaatiota, koska ne rohkaisevat yrityksiä kehittämään ja markkinoimaan uusia, kestävämpiä ja eettisempiä materiaaleja ja tuotteita. Yhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että tekstiilituotteiden uudet merkintäsäännöt ovat olennaisen tärkeitä ongelmien ratkaisemiseksi, jotka aiheutuvat puutteellisesta tai harhaanjohtavasta informaatiosta kuluttajille. Ne edistävät paremman tiedon saamista, turvallisempaa kulutusta, reilua kilpailua, innovaatiota ja kestävämpää kehitystä tekstiilialalla."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1999, Aaliyah landed her first film role in Romeo Must Die, released March 22, 2000. Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to \\"make it easier on\\" herself, but she heard \\"that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted.\\" In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was \\"a natural\\" and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, \\"they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks.

Skim reading involves reading very quickly, only briefly pausing to examine details. Skimming can help you get a general idea of what a piece of writing is about before you read it again, saving you time and energy in the long run. There's no \\"right\\" way to skim read, but one good policy is this: Read the entire intro paragraph Read the first sentence of each body paragraph Read the entire conclusion paragraph Now that you've done a skim reading and you know the rough \\"point\\" of the essay, it's time to read it \\"for real.\\" Proceed through the whole essay again, this time reading each sentence slowly and carefully. Don't hesitate to read sentences or paragraphs again if you're having a hard time understanding the content. Don't rush — slowing down helps you connect with the text. Taking notes in a class can help you retain more information — doing so while reading is no different. Writing down key thoughts and phrases will make you actively pay attention to what’s going on in the text. You can also jot down questions you have so that you can try to answer them later. Mark words and concepts that you don't understand for later reference. If you understand every word and concept you came across in the essay, you're in luck — you can move on. However, if there was anything in the essay that you didn't understand, now is your chance to enlighten yourself. Filling in the gaps in your knowledge will help you gain a fuller understanding of the text. Dictionaries and thesauruses can help with words you don't know. However, technical terms and unknown concepts may require you look up help articles online. For instance, if you're reading an article about \\"4K\\" television, you probably won't be able to find a definition for 4K in the dictionary. Now, do another quick skim reading. After each paragraph, ask yourself, \\"What was the point of what I just read?\\" Express your answer in your own words — try not to copy the essay's.

Step 4: Explore the benefits of the deal's resolution With this deal, Welsh rugby is set to build on its recent successes and create a prosperous future. While the dispute was detrimental to Welsh rugby both on and off the field, its resolution will have positive implications for the sport, players, and fans. The £60m investment in the sport reflects the joint commitment to promoting a stable and competitive professional rugby environment in Wales, fostering a sense of unity and collaboration. Step 5: Look forward to the future of Welsh rugby The signing of this deal promises a brighter future for Welsh rugby. As the agreement ensures the financial support and stability for the sport, Welsh rugby can now focus its energies on building a world-class competitive environment and nurturing homegrown talent.

Question: \\"What was Walter Cunningham's social standing?\\" Context: \\"In a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was \\"to be ... the Jane Austen of South Alabama.\\" Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so. Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia. One writer notes that Scout, \\"in Austenian fashion\\", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify. Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: \\"affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status\\".\\" Answer:","completion":"To determine Walter Cunningham's social standing, I will analyze the context provided and extract relevant information. 1. It is mentioned that Scout embarrasses Walter Cunningham, which indicates that he may come from a lower social standing than her. This assumption is supported by the fact that Walter is described as a \\"poorer classmate.\\" 2. The mention of Atticus respecting Calpurnia's judgment and standing up against Aunt Alexandra for considering firing Calpurnia implies that he values individual worth over social standing. This further suggests that Walter Cunningham's social standing might be lower than that of the Finch family, but Atticus still deems it important to respect him despite his social position. 3. The context also discusses the common values shared by Jane Austen and Harper Lee, which include \\"respect for the individual without regard for status.\\" This implies that the characters in their stories, such as Walter Cunningham, might experience varying social positions, yet they are still depicted as deserving respect and equal rights despite their social status. After analyzing the context, Walter Cunningham's social standing can be inferred to be lower than that of the Finch family. He comes from a poorer background, but the book emphasizes the importance of respecting individuals regardless of their social standing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This means watering them about every 5-7 days through the summer or perhaps every 3 days in very dry, hot weather. Also give your carnations regular feeds, pinch the stems and remove the withered flower heads. It's important to protect perpetual flowering carnations from frost. You can grow them under glass or in a polytunnel, but it's vital to keep them above 45F so you may need a source of heat, even in a greenhouse. Of course, you can also grow them as house plants. Avoid using manure or high-nitrogen fertilizers for carnations, as they won't bloom as well. Also keep in mind that you should never mulch carnation plants. If planted outside, you should add lime to the soil to improve the alkalinity, and use a fertilizer that isn't too high in nitrogen relative to other components, such as potash (potassium) and phosphorus.

This list contains mixed elements like numbers and characters. You need to understand that you're dealing with a diverse list when you initiate the task. Part #2: Identifying elements that are numbers Usage: Among the diverse elements, one would scan through the list and pick out numbers such as '4661', '2865', '4049', '7255', '3267', '7299', '3935', '3183', '3149', '6715', '8781', '2637'. To do this, check whether a Python function, int(), raised a ValueError exception when applied to each element. This way, we can distinguish numeric strings from non-numeric ones. Part #3: Preserving the order of the numbers Usage: In this task, the order in which numbers appear in the original list matters. Hence, while scanning and selecting numbers, make sure you preserve their original order in the list. As an example, for the given sample input the output should have the numbers '4661', '2865', '4049', '7255', '3267', '7299', '3935', '3183', '3149', '6715', '8781', '2637' in this particular order, as they appear in the original list. Part #4: Output of the task Usage: The final output of this task should be a list of all numbers from the original list, presented in their original order. If we apply these instructions to our given sample input, our output should be ['4661', '2865', '4049', '7255', '3267', '7299', '3935', '3183', '3149', '6715', '8781', '2637']. Here, this list is only composed of number strings extracted from the original list, and they've been maintained in the order they appeared."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"Since the Great Collapse, every country on Earth has had a particular national stereotype, and all the history books have been altered to make it seem forever-so.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"History has been changed since the Great Collapse to fit different stereotypes.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, it seems highly likely that the hypothesis \\"History has been changed since the Great Collapse to fit different stereotypes.\\" is true. This conclusion stems from three key factors: the existence of the Great Collapse event, the alteration of history books, and the dissemination of national stereotypes. First, let us examine the Great Collapse event. As a significant incident that impacted every country on Earth, it might have created a before-and-after duality in terms of global dynamics. Thus, the enormous societal and political changes brought about by the Great Collapse could have motivated various actors to alter historical records. Next, the alteration of history books has evidently occurred. If we look more deeply into this aspect, several explanations can be considered: 1. Intentional distortion: Following the Great Collapse, certain political or ideological groups could have sought to consolidate power by imposing their version of history on the general population. Rewriting history books enabled them to create or enhance national stereotypes, shaping citizens' identities and values to suit their agendas. 2. Loss of reliable resources: A significant amount of historical data could have been lost or damaged during the Great Collapse. As a result, some countries may have had to reconstruct their history from scratch, leading to the development of a version riddled with inaccuracies or deliberately adapted to fit specific stereotypes. 3. Fragmentation of historical narratives: In the aftermath of the Great Collapse, countries could have withdrawn into their national shells and adopted insular perspectives. This would result in the creation of competing perspectives on history, where each nation chose to interpret the past through the lens of its unique cultural or nationalistic stereotype. Finally, let us consider the establishment of specific national stereotypes. Given that the history books were altered to emphasize these stereotypes, it is reasonable to infer that the record of past events was manipulated to make them \\"forever-so.\\" For example, if a country's stereotype were to promote its image as a peace-loving, environmentally-conscious society, its history books might overemphasize accomplishments in diplomacy and conservation while downplaying or omitting acts of aggression or exploitation. In conclusion, given the context of the Great Collapse, it is highly probable that the hypothesis \\"History has been changed since the Great Collapse to fit different stereotypes\\" is true. The combination of a world-altering event, the apparent alteration of history books, and the existence of national stereotypes suggest that history has been adjusted and manipulated to perpetuate these characterizations across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Excalibur Context: The sorcerer Merlin (Nicol Williamson) retrieves Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake for Uther Pendragon (Gabriel Byrne), who secures a brief alliance with Gorlois, the Duke of Cornwall. Uther's lust for Cornwall's wife Igrayne (Katrine Boorman) soon ruins the truce, and Merlin agrees to help Uther to seduce Igrayne on the condition that he gives Merlin whatever results from his lust. Merlin transforms Uther into Cornwall's likeness with the Charm of Making. Cornwall's daughter Morgana senses her father's mortal injury during his assault on Uther's camp; and, while Igrayne is fooled by the disguise and Uther impregnates her, Morgana sees through it, watching Uther as Cornwall dies in battle. Nine months later, Merlin takes Uther's son Arthur. Uther pursues but is mortally wounded by Gorlois' knights. Uther thrusts Excalibur into a stone, crying that \\"None shall wield Excalibur, but me!\\", and Merlin proclaims, \\"He who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.\\" Years later Sir Ector and his sons, Kay and Arthur (Nigel Terry) attend a jousting tournament. Sir Leondegrance (Patrick Stewart) wins the chance to try pulling Excalibur from the stone, but he fails. Kay's sword is later stolen, and Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone while trying to replace the stolen sword. Word spreads, and Merlin announces to the crowd that Arthur is Uther's son and, hence, the rightful ruler. Leondegrance immediately proclaims his support for the new king, but not all are willing to accept. While the others argue, Merlin and Arthur enter the forest, where Merlin tells Arthur that he is the rightful king and that the king and the land are one. Overwhelmed, Arthur falls into a long sleep. When he wakes, Arthur goes to aid Leondegrance, whose castle is under siege by Arthur's enemies, led by Sir Uryens. During the battle, Arthur defeats Uryens and then demands Uryens knight him, handing him Excalibur to do so.

Jack has a wife named Maria and three kids named Joanne, Julia, and Andrew. Jack subtly changes the family vacation from a lazy week of Mediterranean fun and sun in Corfu, Greece, to a tour of India, because of a story he has to cover. Maria is not as impressed by this as the kids are. Jack himself envisioned a chance to simultaneously work an easy reporting assignment and spend a little quality time with his family. But on the way to India, the airplane, a 747 owned by AM Air, an American airline, makes an unscheduled stopover in Limassol Cyprus, because of a mechanical problem. After a while of waiting inside the Limassol airport, everyone gets back on the plane -- which is then hijacked by a group of terrorists known as the August 15th Movement, led by a Serbian man named Ivanic Loyvek and his right-hand man Karadan Maldic. The terrorists take a silver briefcase from an diplomatic courier, an older man, and it appears to be an important object of their hijack. And they are demanding 50,000,000 from the US State Department in one hour, or everyone on the airplane will die.The demand is met, and Loyvek and Maldic start releasing the women and children, with the men to go last.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You have complete physical more often happens, how will it affect \\"Kidneys function more poorly\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis concerns the situation in which a person undergoes more frequent complete physical exams. In this scenario, we need to consider whether these frequent physical exams will have a direct or indirect effect on the kidneys functioning poorly. To evaluate the potential impact of this perturbation, we must first review the main processes carried out by the kidneys, as mentioned in the initial question. Kidneys play a critical role in maintaining the body's overall health by: 1. Filtering waste out of the blood 2. Regulating the composition of the blood 3. Maintaining a constant volume of water in blood 4. Keeping pH at a constant level 5. Helping to regulate blood pressure 6. Stimulating the production of red blood cells 7. Maintaining calcium levels Now, let's analyze the potential impacts of undergoing more frequent complete physical exams on these kidney functions. Complete physical exams typically consist of various tests and evaluations to assess an individual's overall health. These exams may include blood tests, measurements of vital signs like blood pressure, and evaluations of organ function, among other assessments. By conducting frequent physical exams, doctors would be able to identify any abnormalities or complications arising from poor kidney function at an early stage. In terms of direct effects, more frequent physical exams could indirectly contribute to better kidney function by: 1. Early identification and treatment of kidney-related issues: Routine physical exams can help detect early signs of kidney problems, such as increased blood pressure, changes in blood chemistry, or imbalances in electrolyte levels. By identifying and addressing these issues early on, doctors can take appropriate measures to manage or even reverse the decline in kidney function. 2. Improved management of comorbidities: Regular physical exams can help manage other health conditions that can negatively impact kidney function, such as diabetes and hypertension. Prompt and adequate treatment of these comorbidities can help preserve kidney function and prevent further deterioration. 3. Lifestyle modifications: Frequent physical exams can help guide individuals to adopt healthier lifestyle habits that benefit kidney function, such as exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding smoking or excessive alcohol intake. By making these adjustments under a doctor's guidance, individuals can potentially improve their kidney function and overall health. However, it is important to note that the direct effect of frequent physical exams on kidney function may not be significant, as these exams don't necessarily target the kidneys themselves. Instead, the benefits stem from a more comprehensive approach to managing overall health and associated conditions. In conclusion, while frequent complete physical exams may not have a direct effect on kidney function, they can indirectly support better kidney health by promoting early detection, treatment, and management of health conditions that impact kidney function. Furthermore, they can help guide individuals to adopt healthier lifestyles, which can ultimately lead to improved kidney function and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Add spaces: Temapark(2005)isagoodexampleofthesespatialinterplays.","completion":"The sentence with spaces added becomes: \\"Temapark (2005) is a good example of these spatial interplays.\\" In this sentence, the subject is \\"Temapark (2005),\\" an apparent reference to a theme park, project, or event that took place in the year 2005. The predicate of the sentence, \\"is a good example of these spatial interplays,\\" indicates that Temapark 2005 serves as a noteworthy illustration of spatial interplays. Spatial interplays refer to the relationships and interactions between various elements within a defined space. This concept is frequently used in disciplines such as architecture, urban planning, and geography to describe how different components, such as physical structures, natural features, and human activities, work together within a particular environment. The spatial interplay can also encompass intangible factors such as culture and social dynamics. In the context of a theme park, spatial interplay might refer to the arrangement and layout of attractions, walking paths, and other amenities within the park. This can involve placing contrasting attractions near one another to create a sense of variety or grouping similar attractions together to establish themed areas. It could also refer to taking advantage of natural features, such as hills and trees, to enhance the park's visual appeal, provide shade, or create geographical landmarks. Another potential aspect of spatial interplay in a theme park setting is the flow of visitor traffic. Designers and planners may use various techniques to encourage people to move through the park in specific patterns or to distribute crowds evenly, thus minimizing congestion and long queues for popular rides. This can involve using strategic signage, subtle changes in path width or paving materials, or incorporating visual \\"magnet\\" features – such as iconic landmarks or large-scale sculptures – to draw people toward certain areas of the park. Furthermore, spatial interplay can extend to how the theme park relates to its surrounding environment, such as integrating the park's edges with nearby urban or rural areas, preserving and celebrating local ecological features, or incorporating elements of local history and culture into the park's design. By describing Temapark (2005) as a good example of these spatial interplays, the sentence suggests that this particular park successfully demonstrates a thorough understanding of the interplay among the many elements that contribute to creating an engaging, functional, and aesthetically pleasing environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: You might not understand exactly what your friend is going through, but you can still let them know you’re there to support them. Reassure them that they’re not alone and that you’re there to listen and help them if they need it. It can sometimes be helpful to share a story about a time when you were emotionally struggling and asked for help. This lets your friend know that difficult times happen to everyone and that it’s okay to reach out. Asking the right question will not only help you better understand what your friend is going through, it will help your friend get out their emotions. Try to keep questions open-ended to encourage your friend to talk about what they’re thinking and feeling rather than probing for details. Questions like, “How are you feeling right now?” give your friend more space to express their emotion than questions like, “Are you mad?” It can take a lot of courage for your friend to reach out, especially if they’ve done something they’re not proud of. Try to listen to them without judgment. You don’t need to agree with what they’re saying or what they did, but remember that all people make mistakes. Listen, and understand that your friend has flaws just like every other person. Avoid placing blame for problems. If your friend cheated on a test, for example, don’t tell them they’re a bad student. Instead, say, “Math can be a tricky subject. Instead of cheating next time, though, why don’t we do our homework together so I can tutor you?” If your friend needs help to get them through a difficult time, offer to help them reach out. It can be scary and isolating to ask for help on your own. Offer to go with them or help them research options. This lets them know they’re not alone, and that it’s okay to get help for hard times. For example, if your friend is struggling with depression, they might be afraid to talk to a therapist. Offer to look up a few therapists in their area that specialize in helping patients with depression.","completion":"Support your friend by reassuring them that they're not alone and you're there to listen and help.

Question: When was the venu where the 1966 NASCAR season opened constructed? Passage 1:Born in Lichfield, Staffordshire, Leadbitter was a successful grasstrack racer before taking up speedway in 1966 at the training school at Long Eaton. After a single match for Glasgow Tigers in 1966 he rode in four matches for Long Eaton Archers in 1967. In 1968 he was signed by newly formed Leicester Lions, but only made one appearance for the team that season, spending most of it on loan to Middlesbrough Teessiders. In 1969 he progressed with Middlesbrough, averaging close to nine points per match, and had rode in four matches in the top division as a guest for Newcastle Diamonds. In 1970 he stayed with Middlesbrough as well as riding in several matches for his parent club Leicester, and was recalled to a full team place for the Lions in 1971. He competed in the Second Division Riders Championship in 1970, finishing in fifth place. At the end of the season he transferred to Wolverhampton Wolves where he spent four seasons, establishing himself as a solid scorer, although in 1975 his rides for Wolves were limited and he returned to Teesside in the National League where he averaged over nine points and recorded five full maximum and three paid maximum scores in 33 matches. After a second season back with Teesside in 1976 he moved on to Bristol Bulldogs in 1977, his final season before retiring. Passage 2:The 1966 NASCAR season opened at Augusta Speedway on November 14, 1965, with Richard Petty winning the season opening event in a 1965 Plymouth. NASCAR then ventured to Riverside International Raceway where Dan Gurney took the checkered flag in a 1965 Ford. After the January 23rd Riverside event, the drivers and teams traveled to Daytona International Speedway in Florida for the 1966 Daytona 500. Paul Goldsmith and Early Balmer took the qualifying events, while Richard Petty notched his first and only Daytona 500 pole position. Petty came from two laps down during the competition to win by more than a full lap when the race was halted 2 laps shy of scheduled event due to thunderstorms. In March Paul Goldsmith won at Rockingham Speedway, Dick Hutcherson at Bristol, and Jim Hurtubise captured the checkered flag at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Hutcherson's victory at Bristol was by more than 4 laps over the closest competitor, Paul Lewis, when crashes and attrition left only seven cars of the 38 starters running at the end of the Southeastern 500 (now known as Food City 500). On April 3, Pearson finally found his way to victory lane in the first of four consecutive victories at Hickory Motor Speedway. He followed up with wins at Columbia Speedway, Greenville, and Winston-Salem, before Jim Paschal broke his streak at North Wilksboro and repeated at Martinsville Speedway. On May 7, Richard Petty started a string of three consecutive wins at Darlington Raceway, Hampton, and Macon. After Ford's announcement of their boycott of NASCAR on April 7, only 2.500 fans attend the May 13th event in which Darel Dieringer captures the win at Monroe in a contest. Passage 3:Sir Nicholas Fuller (1543 – 23 February 1620) was an English barrister and Member of Parliament. After studying at Christ's College, Cambridge, Fuller became a barrister of Gray's Inn. His legal career there began prosperously—he was employed by the Privy Council to examine witnesses—but was hampered later by his representation of the Puritans, a religious tendency which did not conform with the established Church of England. Fuller was repeatedly in contention with the ecclesiastical courts, including the Star Chamber and Court of High Commission, and was once expelled for the zeal with which he defended his client. In 1593 he was returned as the Member of Parliament for St Mawes, where he campaigned against the extension of recusancy laws. Outside of Parliament, he successfully brought a patents case which not only undermined the right of the Crown to issue patents but accurately predicted the attitude taken by the Statute of Monopolies two decades later.","completion":"Passage 2"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Research available data on Donald Trump's IQ. Justification: To answer this question, we need to search for any credible sources that have information about his IQ. Upon researching, there is no definitive public record of Donald Trump's actual IQ. Many claims have been made, but they are not based on verified or official assessments. Question 1: Is he really a politician or comedian? Step 1: Analyze his profession and accomplishments. Justification: To determine if someone is a politician, comedian, or both, it's important to assess their profession and career accomplishments. Donald Trump is a businessman and a television personality. He became the 45th President of the United States in the 2016 election. His career as a politician is unquestionable given that he served as the president. Although he has made many statements that some people find humorous, he is not primarily known for being a comedian. It's safe to say he is more of a politician.

For evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant, without being unfairly prejudicial, and it must have some indicia of reliability. The general rule in evidence is that all relevant evidence is admissible and all irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. - Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of anthropology and its various subfields, including forensic archaeology and forensic taphonomy, in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable, as might happen in a plane crash. Forensic anthropologists are also instrumental to the investigation and documentation of genocide and mass graves. Along with forensic pathologists, forensic dentists, and homicide investigators, forensic anthropologists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses. Using physical markers present on a skeleton, a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a victim's age, sex, stature, and ancestry. In addition to identifying physical characteristics of the individual, forensic anthropologists can use skeletal abnormalities to potentially determine cause of death, past trauma such as broken bones or medical procedures, as well as diseases such as bone cancer. - The American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) is a society for forensics professionals, founded in 1948.

A friend asked me to answer this question: In what year did the Chicago Symphony Orchestra travel to Europe?, using the article: In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse.

What is the answer?","completion":"The Rolls-Royce engines used to power Concorde were the Olympus 593 Mk 610 turbojet engines. These engines were specifically developed for supersonic aviation, enabling Concorde to reach its top cruising speed of Mach 2.04 (around 1,354 mph or 2,180 km/h) and maintain it for extended periods. The Olympus 593 Mk 610 engines were a collaboration between Rolls-Royce (UK) and Snecma (France), both of which were leading aerospace engine manufacturers. This joint development allowed the project to pool resources and expertise from the United Kingdom and France, as both countries were involved in the development and production of Concorde. This engine design was based on the original Rolls-Royce Olympus engines that were initially developed in the 1950s for military aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan. Over the years, the Olympus engines went through multiple design stages and performance upgrades, culminating in the Olympus 593 optimized for supersonic passenger aircraft. The Olympus 593 Mk 610 engines were unique and packed with advanced technologies in order to meet the challenging requirements of Concorde. Some of the key features of these engines included: 1. Power and efficiency: The Olympus 593 engines were extremely powerful, each producing 32,000 to 38,000 pounds of thrust. This massive power enabled Concorde to climb rapidly and reach high altitudes, where it could cruise at supersonic speeds, consuming less fuel in the thinner atmosphere. 2. Variable intake system: At supersonic speeds, the air entering the engine needs to be slowed down to subsonic speeds. The Olympus 593 engines featured a variable intake system that would adjust the intake geometry based on the speed of the aircraft. This ensured that the engines received the optimal airflow in both subsonic and supersonic flight conditions. 3. Afterburners: To achieve supersonic speeds, Concorde required additional thrust, which was provided by afterburners in the Olympus 593 engines. The afterburners would inject fuel into the exhaust stream, igniting it and providing a significant boost in thrust. Concorde mainly used the afterburners during takeoff and while transitioning to supersonic flight. 4. Noise reduction: The Olympus 593 engines were among the first commercial engines to incorporate noise reduction technologies. These included specific tailpipe designs and significantly lower thrust during landing to reduce the sonic boom and overall noise pollution near airports. 5. Advanced materials and construction: The Concorde's engines were subjected to extreme temperatures and stresses during supersonic flight. The Olympus 593 engines used advanced materials such as titanium and other high-temperature alloys to withstand these challenging conditions. In summary, the Rolls-Royce Olympus 593 Mk 610 engines powered Concorde as it made history by providing supersonic transport to the general public, thus revolutionizing civil aviation. The engines' innovative technology and capabilities played a significant role in the aircraft's distinguished service and the public's perception of the Concorde as a symbol of technological advancement and luxury air travel."},{"prompt":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is cta used for Suggested answer: Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a computed tomography technique used to visualize arterial and venous vessels throughout the body.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Intraplate earthquakes occur because solid lithosphere travels on a round planet. Q: What occur because solid lithosphere travels on a round planet? Choices: - aeration earthquakes - volcanos - ejecta earthquakes - intraplate earthquakes A: A:","completion":"Intraplate earthquakes occur because solid lithosphere travels on a round planet. In this case, the correct answer would be intraplate earthquakes. Intraplate earthquakes are seismic events that take place within the interior of a tectonic plate, as opposed to occurring at the boundaries between two plates. The Earth's lithosphere, which comprises the crust and upper mantle, is divided into several tectonic plates that float on the more fluid asthenosphere beneath them. As mentioned in the given paragraph, the Earth is round, meaning that the lithosphere needs to bend and flex to accommodate the curvature of the planet. This bending puts stress on the lithosphere, which can gradually accumulate and lead to the release of energy in the form of earthquakes. Intraplate earthquakes are less common and generally less powerful than those occurring at plate boundaries, but they can still cause significant damage and pose a risk to populated areas located far from the more familiar plate boundary zones. The other choices mentioned are not directly related to the solid lithosphere traveling on a round planet. Aeration earthquakes and ejecta earthquakes are not recognized terms in the field of earth science. Volcanoes, while still a result of tectonic activity and processes within the Earth's lithosphere, do not occur solely because of the lithosphere traveling on a round planet. Volcanic activity is more commonly associated with the movement and interaction of the tectonic plates, particularly at convergent and divergent boundaries, where one plate can subduct beneath another, leading to the generation of magma and the formation of volcanoes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He looked around his kitchen, trying to find another container that would better fit the delicious lasagna he had just spent hours preparing. The aromas of the dish filled the cramped space, reminding him of his grandmother's kitchen back in Italy. As a third-generation cook in his family, the chef wanted to make sure his creations remained true to their origins. As sweat dripped down the side of his face, he spotted a larger container on a higher shelf. Struggling to reach, he stretched his arm upwards and finally retrieved it. Luckily for him, it was the perfect size! He carefully transferred the lasagna layers into the new container without compromising the structural integrity of the dish. The cheese and tomato sauce intertwined harmoniously, creating a visually appealing presentation. He couldn't help but feel proud of his work. Once the lasagna was safely placed inside the new container, he sealed it tightly to prevent any accidental spillage. The chef then checked his watch, realizing that the clock was ticking. His family would be arriving soon for their weekly Sunday dinner, and he had yet to prepare the additional dishes his grandmother had passed down through the family over generations. Rushing around the kitchen, he began working on the caprese salad. He sliced the ripe tomatoes and fresh mozzarella with precision, alternating their placements on a serving platter. Before drizzling a generous amount of balsamic glaze and sprinkling fresh basil leaves on top, he gave the platter a dash of salt and cracked pepper – his secret touch. Next, he tackled the creamy risotto dish, ensuring that the Arborio rice was cooked to perfection by tasting it along the way. The chef stirred continuously, combining the rice, white wine, chicken broth, and sautéed mushrooms with the utmost dedication. The risotto became creamy and delicious, just as his grandmother had taught him. There was something so comforting about standing in his kitchen preparing the dishes he had grown up with, passing along the love that his family had cultivated around food. Moving on to the mixed grilled vegetables, he ensured that the grill pan was hot before placing the mixture of zucchini, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, and asparagus on it. The sizzle of the vegetables on the pan filled the kitchen with an addictive sound and the scent of charred goodness. He quickly tossed the vegetables in olive oil, garlic, and rosemary, creating an irresistible combination. Returning to the centerpiece of the meal, he preheated the oven and inserted the lasagna, allowing it to bake to a bubbling perfection. As the lasagna's flavors melded in the heat, his home filled with the familiar aroma that brought back memories of his family roots. Finally, as the front door opened and the buzz of his relatives' cheerful greetings filled the hallway, the chef breathed a sigh of relief. The dishes were complete, and he tied his apron around his waist with a sense of pride, knowing that he had successfully continued the traditions established by his ancestors. As they sat around the table, laughter and conversation joined the chorus of clattering silverware and satisfied moans. The chef watched his family indulge in his carefully prepared meal, and in that moment, with each delectable bite his loved ones took, he felt a deep connection to his past and the generations that had come before him – all working together to weave a beautiful tapestry, one hearty dish at a time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". - Raffaele Sansoni Galeoti Riario ( May 3 , 1461 -- July 9 , 1521 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Renaissance , mainly known as the constructor of the Palazzo della Cancelleria and the person who invited Michelangelo to Rome .

He was also the first adolescent to be elevated in the College of Cardinals in the history of the Holy See . - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The 1st century was the century that lasted from AD 1 to AD 100 according to the Julian calendar. It is often written as the or to distinguish it from the 1st century BC (or BCE) which preceded it. The 1st century is considered part of the \\"Classical era, epoch, or historical period\\". - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency. - Rione (plural: \\"rioni\\") is the name given to a neighbourhood in several Italian cities. A \\"rione\\" is just a territorial subdivision. The administrative subdivisions in Rome are the Municipi. The word derives from the , the 14 subdivisions of Rome imposed by Augustus.

Functions. A function of the college is to advise the pope about church matters when he summons them to an ordinary consistory, a term derived from the Roman Emperor's crown council. It also attends various functions as a matter of protocol, for example, during the canonization process. It also convenes on the death or resignation of a pope as a papal conclave to elect a successor, but is then restricted to eligible Cardinals under the age limit, which was set for the first time in 1970 by Pope Paul VI at 80. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - The Holy See is the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church in Rome, the episcopal see of the Pope, and an independent sovereign entity. It serves as the central point of reference for the Catholic Church everywhere and the focal point of communion due to its position as the pre-eminent episcopal see of the universal church. It traces its origin to the 1st century during the apostolic era, when Saint Peter arrived in Rome to evangelise and formed a significant early Christian community of believers there. Today, it is responsible for the governance of all Catholics, organised in their Particular Churches, Patriarchates and religious institutes. - The Palazzo della Cancelleria (Italian for \\"Palace of the Chancellery\\", meaning the Papal Chancellery) is a Renaissance palace in Rome, Italy, situated between the present Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and the Campo de' Fiori, in the rione of Parione. It was built between 14891513 by Donato Bramante (14441514) as a palace for Cardinal Raffaele Riario, Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, and is regarded as the earliest Renaissance palace in Rome. The palazzo houses the Papal Chancellery, is an extraterritorial property of the Holy See and is designated as a World Heritage Site. - Donato Bramante (1444 11 March 1514), born as Donato di Pascuccio d'Antonio and also known as Bramante Lazzari, was an Italian architect. He introduced Renaissance architecture to Milan and the High Renaissance style to Rome, where his plan for St. Peter's Basilica formed the basis of design executed by Michelangelo. His Tempietto (San Pietro in Montorio) marked the beginning of the High Renaissance in Rome (1502) when Pope Julius II appointed him to build a sanctuary over the spot where Peter was allegedly crucified. Life. Urbino. Bramante was born under the name Donato d'Augnolo, Donato di Pascuccio d'Antonio, or Donato Pascuccio d'Antonio in Fermignano near Urbino. Here, in 1467, Luciano Laurana was adding to the Palazzo Ducale an arcaded courtyard and other Renaissance features to Federico da Montefeltro's ducal palace. Bramante's architecture has eclipsed his painting skills: he knew the painters Melozzo da Forlì and Piero della Francesca well, who were interested in the rules of perspective and illusionistic features in Mantegna's painting. - Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci. - Pope Paul VI, born Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini (26 September 1897 6 August 1978), reigned as Pope from 21 June 1963 to his death in 1978. Succeeding Pope John XXIII, he continued the Second Vatican Council which he closed in 1965, implementing its numerous reforms, and fostered improved ecumenical relations with Eastern Orthodox and Protestants, which resulted in many historic meetings and agreements. Montini served in the Vatican's Secretariat of State from 1922 to 1954. While in the Secretariat of State, Montini and Domenico Tardini were considered as the closest and most influential colleagues of Pope Pius XII, who in 1954 named him Archbishop of Milan, the largest Italian diocese. Montini later became the Secretary of the Italian Bishops Conference. John XXIII elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1958, and after the death of John XXIII, Montini was considered one of his most likely successors. - In art history, High Renaissance is the period denoting the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance. The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with Leonardo's fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V. This term was first used in German (Hochrenaissance) in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the \\"High Style\\" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works. - The Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church is an office of the Papal household that administrates the property and revenues of the Holy See. Formerly, his responsibilities included the fiscal administration of the Patrimony of St. Peter. As regulated in the Apostolic Constitution \\"Pastor Bonus\\" (1988), the Camerlengo is always a Cardinal, though this was not the case prior to the 15th century. His heraldic arms are ornamented with two keysone gold, one silverin saltire surmounted by an ombrellino, a canopy or umbrella of alternating red and yellow stripes. These are also the arms of the Holy See during a Papal interregnum. - Raffaele Sansoni Galeoti Riario (3 May 1461 9 July 1521) was an Italian Cardinal of the Renaissance, mainly known as the constructor of the Palazzo della Cancelleria and the person who invited Michelangelo to Rome.

Ivan Pavlov was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1904 for his work on the physiology of digestion. In his famous experiment, Pavlov used dogs to study their salivary response to various stimuli. Initially, he observed that the dogs would naturally salivate when they saw food. He then rang a bell before presenting them with food, during which the dogs would also salivate. After several repetitions of this process, Pavlov discovered that the dogs would begin to salivate just at the sound of the bell, even without the presence of food. This is the phenomenon of classical conditioning, where an organism learns to associate a neutral stimulus (in this case, the bell) with a natural response (salivation), eventually causing the neutral stimulus to trigger the response on its own. Pavlov's research has had a wide-ranging impact on the fields of psychology and education, as it provided deeper insights into how learning occurs and helped lay the groundwork for theories of learning and behavior modification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is difference between moving coil and moving iron ammeter? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, both questions essentially ask for the differences between moving-iron and moving-coil instruments, with a specific focus on ammeters. Now, let's explore the key differences between moving-iron and moving-coil instruments. 1. Operating Principle: Moving-Iron Instruments: These instruments are based on the principle of attraction of a soft iron piece towards a magnetic field when current passes through a coil. The movement of the soft iron piece (moving iron) generates deflection proportional to the amount of current passing through the coil. They can be used to measure both alternating and direct current. Moving-Coil Instruments: In moving-coil instruments, a coil carrying current (moving coil) is placed in a uniform magnetic field produced by a permanent magnet. The interaction between the magnetic field and the current in the coil results in a deflecting torque, which is proportional to the current being measured. These instruments are primarily designed for direct current (DC) measurements, but with modifications, they can be used for alternating current (AC). 2. Construction: Moving-Iron Instruments: These instruments consist of a moving iron piece (sometimes called a vane) and a stationary coil. As current passes through the coil, the moving iron is attracted towards the magnetic field, causing the pointer to deflect on the scale. Moving-Coil Instruments: These instruments have a moving coil that is mounted on a spindle between the poles of a permanent magnet. The coil is connected to a fine spring and a pointer to indicate the deflection. The magnetic field generated by the permanent magnet interacts with the magnetic field produced by the current in the coil to create a torque on the coil. 3. Scale: Moving-Iron Instruments: These instruments generally have a nonlinear scale because the deflecting torque is proportional to the square of the current passing through the coil (T ∝ I^2). This leads to higher torque variations as the current increases. Moving-Coil Instruments: Moving-coil instruments feature a linear scale since the deflecting torque is directly proportional to the current passing through the coil (T ∝ I). This provides a more uniform distribution of scale markings across the measurement range. 4. Accuracy and Sensitivity: Moving-Iron Instruments: These instruments tend to be less accurate and less sensitive compared to moving-coil instruments due to the nonlinear scale and the presence of hysteresis in the soft iron. Moving-Coil Instruments: The moving-coil instruments offer higher accuracy and sensitivity, primarily due to the linear scale and the absence of hysteresis effect. They have a better response to small changes in current and provide more precise readings. 5. Frequency Response: Moving-Iron Instruments: These instruments can be used to measure both AC and DC current. The frequency response for AC measurements may vary depending on the design and construction of the instrument, but they are generally suitable for usage in a wide range of frequencies. Moving-Coil Instruments: By default, moving-coil instruments are designed for DC measurements. However, with modifications like adding rectifiers or using a dynamometer-type instrument, they can be used for AC measurements. The frequency response for AC measurements is typically limited. To summarize, moving-iron and moving-coil instruments differ in their operating principles, construction, scale, accuracy, sensitivity, and frequency response. While moving-iron instruments can measure both AC and DC currents and have a nonlinear scale, moving-coil instruments are primarily designed for measuring DC currents with a linear scale and offer higher accuracy and sensitivity. Modifications can be done to moving-coil instruments to measure AC currents, but with limitations in frequency response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Second question: How can I thank a relative who was having a personal crisis with finances, health issues, and marital problems yet still stood by me and celebrated my daughter's wedding? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: How do health and education relate to finance? Health, education, and finance have intertwined relationships that significantly influence individual and societal wellbeing. Several aspects link these three aspects together, which can be understood through the following connections. 1. Personal Finance: Health and education play a crucial role in an individual's financial status. A person's health directly impacts their ability to work and generate income. Ill health may lead to loss of work hours, reduced productivity, and increased medical expenses. In contrast, healthier individuals are likely to prosper financially due to higher productivity and a lower financial burden of medical expenses. Education, on the other hand, has a well-established connection to income levels. A better-educated person generally has higher earning potential and financial stability, as education equips people with skills and expertise sought by employers. 2. National Economy: The health and education of a population have a significant impact on a nation's economic growth and prosperity. A healthy, educated, and skilled workforce contributes significantly to increased productivity, innovation, and economic progress. On the contrary, low levels of health and education can impede economic growth, as countries with a sick, uneducated populace will struggle to compete in the global economy and attract investments. 3. Public Finance: Government spending on health and education is an essential component of most countries' budgets. The allocation of public resources to these sectors has a direct impact on the population's wellbeing, as well as long-term economic growth. These investments in health and education yield societal benefits that often translate to improved individual financial outcomes as well. 4. Inequality: Income inequality has a cascading effect on both health and education. People with higher incomes have better access to improved health care, nutritional sustenance, and educational opportunities. This reinforces the cycle of financial wellbeing, leading to further social and economic disparities. Second question: How can I thank a relative who was having a personal crisis with finances, health issues, and marital problems yet still stood by me and celebrated my daughter's wedding? Expressing gratitude to your relative can be done in several heartfelt and meaningful ways: 1. Personalized Letter: Write a sincere, heartfelt letter detailing the various ways your relative supported you during your daughter's wedding. Acknowledge their personal struggles and express admiration for their strength and selflessness. 2. Quality Time: Plan a day or weekend to spend time with your relative, doing something they enjoy. This shared experience conveys your appreciation and strengthens your relationship. 3. Gift: Choose a meaningful gift that reflects your relative's interests or needs, demonstrating that you pay attention to their likes and personal circumstances. 4. Support: Offer your support in their times of struggle. Listen to their concerns, provide a helping hand, or connect them to appropriate resources to help them through their challenging times. 5. Public Appreciation: Acknowledge and thank your relative in public, such as during a family gathering. This public recognition can serve as a reminder to your relative that their efforts were noticed and appreciated. In conclusion, the two questions you presented are not asking the same thing. The first question examines the relationship between health, education, and finance. In contrast, the second question focuses on expressing gratitude to a relative who, despite their personal struggles, supported you during an important family event. While finance is a minor aspect in the second question, the main theme differs significantly from the first question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - Nova Scotia (Latin for \\"New Scotland\\"; French: \\"Nouvelle-Écosse\\") is one of Canada's three Maritime provinces, and one of the four provinces which form Atlantic Canada. Its provincial capital is Halifax. Nova Scotia is Canada's second-smallest province, with an area of , including Cape Breton and another 3,800 coastal islands. As of 2011, the population was 921,727, making Nova Scotia the second most-densely populated province in Canada with almost . - Responsible government is a conception of a system of government that embodies the principle of parliamentary accountability, the foundation of the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. Governments (the equivalent of the executive branch) in Westminster democracies are responsible to parliament rather than to the monarch, or, in a colonial context, to the imperial government, and in a republican context, to the president, either in full or in part. If the parliament is bicameral, then the government is responsible first to the parliament's lower house, which is more numerous, always directly elected and thus more representative than the upper house. Responsible government of parliamentary accountability manifests itself in several ways. Ministers account to Parliament for their decisions and for the performance of their departments. This requirement to make announcements and to answer questions in Parliament means that ministers have to have the privileges of the \\"floor\\" which are only granted to those who are members of either house of Parliament. Secondly, and most importantly, although ministers are officially appointed by the authority of the head of state and can theoretically be dismissed at the pleasure of the sovereign, they concurrently retain their office subject to their holding the confidence of the lower house of Parliament. When the lower house has passed a motion of no confidence in the government, the government must immediately resign or submit itself to the electorate in a new general election. - The Nova Scotia Legislature, formally, known as the General Assembly, consists of the Crown represented by a Lieutenant Governor and the House of Assembly, is the legislative branch of the provincial government of Nova Scotia, Canada. The assembly is the oldest in Canada, having first sat in 1758, and in 1848 was the site of the first responsible government in the British Empire. - Andrew Younger is a Canadian politician , who was elected to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in the 2009 provincial election . He represents the electoral district of Dartmouth East as an independent . He was previously part of the Nova Scotia Liberal Party caucus and had served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Energy and Minister of the Environment . - Dartmouth East is a provincial electoral district in Nova Scotia, Canada, that elects one member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. The riding is located in the Dartmouth region of the Halifax RM.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the title of the person that the gun was illegally taken from after it was paid for? ? A series of interweaving stories tell the journey of a handgun — specifically, a .38 special revolver — as it passes from one owner to another. In all the time it passes between its various owners, it is never actually fired (aside from the one test-firing it underwent at the factory) and is never shown actually to discharge any ammunition.The opening credits run over scenes of the manufacture of the weapon. It is shipped to a gun store, where it is purchased by an older business owner whose home was recently burglarized. His wife is uncomfortable with the weapon in the house and convinces him to get rid of it. He gives it away to a security guard at his company, who pawns the gun. A young professional asks for a gun at the pawn shop. He is displeased when told there is a five-day waiting period required by law. When the pawnbroker turns to get the blank paperwork, he loads the gun with his own bullets and departs at gunpoint after paying for the pistol. At his place of employment, he is given the news that because he has the least seniority, he is being laid off. He considers shooting his supervisor before walking outside to the building's plaza during lunchtime, making mock shooting motions at random bystanders with the gun.

Answer with \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". Input: The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. <sep>Who blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks, and froze 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits belonging to the Afghan central bank?<sep>US Banks Output:","completion":"No"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question. Which animal is traditionally used to hunt for truffles?","completion":"The animal traditionally used to hunt for truffles is the highly skilled and expertly trained pig, specifically the \\"Lagotto Romagnolo\\" breed, which hails from the Italian region of Romagna. Truffles, a highly valued and sought-after luxury food item, are a type of edible fungi that grow underground near tree roots. They are found predominantly in France, Italy, and other European countries. Pigs, particularly the female pigs called 'sows,' have an exceptional sense of smell that enables them to locate the truffles growing beneath the ground. This impressive olfactory ability is in part due to a compound commonly found in truffles called 'androstenone,' which mimics the smell of male pig pheromones. Androstenone-laden truffles act as a strong attractant for female pigs, and once the pigs locate the truffle, they are trained to then dig them up with their snouts. Using pigs for truffle hunting, however, comes with its own set of challenges. As truffles are a delicious treat for pigs as well as humans, the pigs have a tendency to eat the truffles once they've been located. Truffle hunters need to be extremely vigilant so that they can retrieve the truffle before the pig has a chance to consume it. Training is also a vital part of the process, with some pigs being trained from young age to recognize and find truffles, while also learning to be less enticed to eat them. In more recent times, another animal has entered the world of truffle hunting: dogs. Dogs with a keen sense of smell have taken up the mantle of truffle hunting, and breeds such as the Lagotto Romagnolo have become synonymous with this specialized skill. Dogs are trained to use their amazing olfactory ability to recognize the unique scent of truffles, and then alert their human counterparts when one has been found. The advantage of using dogs over pigs is that dogs do not have the same innate desire to consume truffles like pigs do, making them a less risky option in the process of truffle hunting. Additionally, dogs are more easily trained to follow specific commands, making them more manageable during hunts. Some truffle hunters believe that using dogs instead of pigs also results in less damage to the prized truffle during the retrieval process, which in turn helps retain the truffle’s value. In conclusion, while pigs, specifically the Lagotto Romagnolo breed, have been the primary truffle hunting animal used traditionally, dogs are becoming a popular and more manageable alternative. Each animal offers its own set of advantages and challenges in the world of truffle hunting, but ultimately both can be quite effective in locating and retrieving these delectable and highly prized fungal delicacies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Touching unseen Princess Diana letters written about Princes William and Harry have emerged for auction The letters belonged to the late Cyril Dickman, who served as a palace steward at Buckingham Palace for more than 50 years HEARTWARMING unseen letters from Princess Diana which reveal about Prince William and Prince Harry’s childhood are up for auction. The notes are being sold by the family of the late Cyril Dickman, who served as a palace steward at Buckingham Palace for more than 50 years. In one touching letter, dated March 2, 1985, Princess Diana revealed Prince William’s delight after Prince Harry was born in September 1984, writing: “William adores his little brother and spends the entire time swamping Harry with an endless supply of hugs and kisses, hardly letting the parents near!” She also spoke of how she and Prince Charles had been ‘overwhelmed’ by the reaction to Harry’s birth and could ‘hardly breathe from the mass of flowers’. Another letter, dated July 18, 1993, reveals the naughty side of Prince Harry, then aged eight. Diana wrote: “The boys are well and enjoying boarding school a lot, although Harry is constantly in trouble!” Prince Harry was a pupil at private Ludgrove School in Berkshire at the time and the letter shows his cheeky spirit which is his signature trait. Mr Dickman died aged 85 in 2012 and the letters were uncovered by his grandson. Other items in the auction include signed Christmas cards from Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, with the lot valued at £15,000. Mr Dickman started his career at Buckingham Palace watching out for fires on the roof during the Blitz. The high esteem he was held in by Princess Diana is reflected by the fact she confided in him about the death of her grandmother, the Baroness Fermoy, in July 1993. In a letter dated July 18, 1993, she writes: “Thank you so much for your lovely letter concerning my Grandmother. “Her death came as a great shock, but it has meant an enormous amount to receive messages of support such as yours. “I often think of you and Mrs Dickman and hope that life is treating you kindly.” Mr Dickman retired at the age of 65 and was made a Freeman of the City of London. In 1993, Mr Dickman was advisor to Sir Anthony Hopkins for his role as a butler in the film Remains of the Day. Diana mentioned his star turn in one of her letters to the palace steward, saying ‘I wait with interest to see the film’. Dylan Mander, specialist at Cambridge-based auctioneers Cheffins which is auctioning off Mr Dickman’s letters, said: “Cyril’s grandson came in and said while he was going through everything he found all of these amazing letters from Princess Diana. “The letters explained all different things – how Harry had been naughty at school and how Harry was adored by his brother who would not stop kissing him. “It is incredibly rare to have letters from Princess Diana with such a personal touch to them. “She would not have had friends in the sense we do so you could say Cyril Dickman was one of her closest friends.” Cheffins’ sale takes place in Cambridge on January 5.

Not exactly. “In Christian families, that would be called a Christmas tree holder,” Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, wryly explained to his Jewish friend. It was the end of the real “Alpha House,” the crumbling gray-blue rowhouse in the shadow of the Capitol where a group of powerful Democratic lawmakers — including Mr. Miller, Mr. Schumer, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and a rotating cast of supporting players — have lived for more than three decades. Mr. Miller, the owner of the two-story, two-bedroom house, is retiring after 40 years in Congress and is selling the home that inspired the Amazon web series “Alpha House,” as well as countless punch lines about the crash pad’s fraternity-meets-policy seminar vibe. ||||| Democratic Sens.

The movie is called Stardom. Stardom is a 2000 Canadian comedy-drama film directed by Denys Arcand and written by J.Jacob Potashnik and Arcand. It stars Jessica Paré and Dan Aykroyd. It tells the story of a young girl who tries to cope with her rise to stardom after being discovered by a fashion agency. The film was screened out of competition at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival.","completion":"Yes, the sentence is true based on the provided text. The text states that the movie \\"Stardom\\" is about a young girl who tries to cope with her rise to stardom after being discovered by a fashion agency. This plot aligns with the theme described in the sentence: the struggles of adapting to life in the spotlight. Therefore, the film \\"Stardom\\" is indeed framed around this theme and is about a girl in the situation described above.

However, the star here is Dan Fogler, in a Jack Black kind of role as a Ping Pong protégé turned has-been, Randy Daytona. The acting is fine, and its always great to see Christopher Walken back on screen. The story is pretty much a by-the-numbers spoof of Bruce Lees Enter the Dragon, with some James Bond, Scarface and every clichéd martial arts film ever made. The script, the bread and butter of every comedy, is only passable, with more smiles and chuckles than laughs.Randy Daytona loses the 1988 Olympic Gold medal for ping-pong, and his father on the same day, and becomes a has-been haunted by his line, Im going to Disneyland.

Pick from: (I) Nuclear power (II) Solar power","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question and the given choices. The goal is to determine which type of power is better for a person who wants to be off the grid—either nuclear power or solar power. Step 2: Analyze the potential of each power source with respect to the goal. Option I: Nuclear power Nuclear power involves the use of nuclear reactions to generate electricity. While it can produce large amounts of energy, it also has some challenges including safety concerns, environmental risks, and the need for proper disposal of radioactive waste. Additionally, nuclear power plants require significant investment and are usually centralized, which may not be suitable for an individual looking to be off the grid. Option II: Solar power Solar power involves converting sunlight into electricity. It offers a renewable and relatively sustainable energy source with little to no pollution. The technology can be adapted for small-scale use, making it appropriate for individuals wanting to be off the grid. It can also be combined with battery storage systems to maximize its potential. Step 3: Compare the two and make a decision. Considering the factors mentioned above, solar power (Option II) seems to be the better choice to meet the goal of being off the grid. It is more accessible, suitable, and environmentally friendly for a single user compared to nuclear power.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What an entertaining movie. Astaire and Randolph Scott are in the Navy. Astaire has to woo back Ginger in San Francisco, while Scott must be persuaded that Harriet Hilliard is worthy of being his wife. Everything works out fine. It's sometimes argued, and I can see why, that Scott's romance with Hilliard is unnecessary and slows the plot down. Especially painful are Hilliard's singing of sappy love songs. I could have done without her singing, right enough, but I found the romance rather touching. Hilliard enters the movie as a music teacher, wearing a pair of spectacles, no makeup, and the ugliest clothes known to man or beast. No wonder Scott avoids her until she grooms herself sexily under the tutelage of her sister Ginger and a slinky Lucille Ball. The problem is that AFTER her makeover she looks like the same irretrievably plain woman as before, only with a glossier outfit. It's tough enough for a homely guy. But at least a man can become wealthy and powerful and popular, then he can collect women anyway, even if he looks like JoJo the Dog-Faced Boy. But what does a plain-looking woman do? The same avenues to romance aren't open to her. Henry Kissinger had groupies. Did Margaret Thatcher? It must be terrible to be an ordinary woman in a culture as cruel as ours. As a kind of a footnote, I must mention that Randolph Scott was rumored to be bisexual by Hollywood gossips who needed some nonsense to chew on, and it's kind of amusing that he has the following line in this film when he's putting homely Hilliard off -- \\"Women don't interest me, sister.\\" The movie probably gives more quality time to Ginger Rogers than any of her other films with Astaire. And she's marvelous. She's beautiful, sexy, a talented actress and dancer, and the script gives her good comic lines too. \\"Let's kiss and make up,\\" suggests Astaire. \\"Let's just make up,\\" she says, \\"that will give you something to work on.\\" It's also the only film she made with Astaire that gives her a solo number during an audition. (Choreographed by Hermes Pan.) Her performance is accidentally sabotaged by Astaire who slips some Alka Seltzer or something into her water, and she hiccups through her number, burping being too indelicate for the time. As a dancer, I'd make a terrific circus elephant so my opinion must be taken as that of an amateur, but I think their dances together are the equal of any they put on film. Their first, during a dancing contest, \\"Let Yourself Go,\\" is the most wildly exuberant of any I can remember. And the only dramatic duet, \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance,\\" must be among their finest. The last step as they exit is startling. I like the film for reasons with personal resonance. I remember seeing it for the first time in a theater in downtown San Diego, next to a shop called \\"The Seven Seas\\" that catered to sailors. I was in uniform at the time and was impressed with the treatment of the naval careers of Astaire and Scott. What I mean is, here we have this frothy musical comedy which owed absolutely nothing to historical reality, and yet, unlike most of their other teamings, pays its dues anyway. Jumping ship, Astaire calls out for a \\"water taxi.\\" I had just taken a water taxi ashore myself. The uniforms are correct to the period (unlike, say, those in \\"On the Town\\"). And they're worn properly, hats down to two finger-widths above the eyebrow and not cocked back. And there are two incidents in which Astaire runs into a problem with naval authorities and they're both handled with perfect seriousness and are thoroughly believable. An officer stops Astaire from leading a jazz band during inspection and reports to the captain, \\"They were playing when the call was sounded, sir. I'm certain no breach of discipline was intended.\\" It's what an officer -- a good officer -- would say, and nobody laughs. The series was getting a little repetitious by the time \\"Follow the Fleet\\" was made so instead of putting Fred into high society and a tuxedo, they turned him into a gum-chewing swabbie instead. It was a good idea. And the dance numbers are up to the concept. Would you say this review is positive or negative? Pick your answer from: [1]. negative.

Expect law enforcement agencies to favor applicants with a clean record. Anticipate a background check when you apply. Refrain from criminal behavior. Agencies will still consider applicants with less than spotless records. So don’t worry if you incur minor infractions, like parking tickets or noise complaints. Deal with them in a timely manner to demonstrate responsibility. Concentrate on sciences, including biology, chemistry, and physics. Take electives that focus on computers, since these are important tools in the CSI’s lab. Use less obvious courses, clubs, and activities to strengthen other skillsets that CSIs need to perform their jobs effectively. For instance: Participate in theater or the debate club to become a confident public speaker. Join the school paper to practice writing concise reports. Take part in photography clubs or classes. Although educational requirements vary by agency, give yourself the most options possible by pursuing some level of higher learning. Aim for an associate’s, bachelor’s, or master’s degree from an accredited college or university. If possible, enroll in a school that offers degrees in criminal justice, forensic science, and/or crime scene investigations. If not, major in biology, chemistry, or a similar hard science. Some agencies may only require a high school diploma or general education diploma (GED). However, these agencies are more likely to be found in areas with very small populations and fewer CSI positions to fill. If you are unable or uninterested in pursuing a traditional degree through a two- or four-year school, consider alternate means. Research accredited online programs that offer certification in forensic science and/or crime scene investigation. Consider attending on-site training courses that do the same.

Q: 崖に生じる上昇気流に舞うカモメのように A:","completion":"The task is asking you to translate a given Japanese sentence into Spanish. Guidelines: 1. First, identify the meaning of the Japanese sentence. The provided sentence is; \\"崖に生じる上昇気流に舞うカモメのように\\" which translates into; \\"Like a seagull dancing in the rising air current on the cliff\\". 2. Make sure you understand all the components of the given sentence. 3. Now you have to translate this sentence into Spanish. You can do this by using translation dictionaries, online translation tools, or your own knowledge of Spanish. How to use these guidelines to find the answer: 1. To translate the sentence correctly, separate the sentence into smaller pieces if necessary, to ensure the most accurate translation possible. 2. Start by translating simpler and more straightforward words, and then focus on more complex phrases or idioms. 3. Once you have translated each word or phrase, work on putting them together in a way that makes sense in Spanish. The structure of Spanish sentences may differ from Japanese sentences, so you might need to switch the position of the translated words. Here's how to translate the given sentence: \\"崖\\" means \\"cliff\\", \\"生じる\\" means \\"occur or arise\\", \\"上昇気流\\" means \\"rising air current\\", \\"舞う\\" means \\"to dance\\", \\"カモメ\\" means \\"seagull\\", \\"の\\" is possessive and \\"ように\\" means \\"like\\".

Title: Absolutely no different than a french press, possibly even worse. Review: This device is seriously overhyped. The coffee it make is absolutely no different than a french press, except with a french press the coffee has longer to steep. The aeropress doesn't even need to be plunged, it's basically a drip system if you leave it long enough. The final press does get you a little strong squirt at the end but made nearly no difference in the taste or bitterness. Additionally, it holds hardly any water, a french press holds plenty of water, makes several cups. I made several cups using aeropress, french press and coffee maker. I dislike coffee makers in general or any drip coffee, and the aeropress tasted just like the coffee maker.I would return this item if I hadn't already used it, you don't return something like that.

Answer:","completion":"This product review conveys a negative sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: When you get your year-end statements in January, take a look at the performance of your mutual funds and rearrange your investments by buying and selling shares. This allows you to retain your original balance. For example, suppose you have 100,000 which you have spread evenly across four different funds. However, at the end of the year, one fund has out-performed the rest so that it is now 30 percent of your portfolio rather than 25 percent. To rebalance your portfolio, you would want to take 5 percent of your shares in that fund and transfer them to the other funds in your portfolio. If your funds are held in a tax-deferred account such as a 401k, transferring assets between funds typically is your best option. However, with taxable accounts it's generally better to simply add new contributions to the lower-performing funds to rebalance. This way you can avoid paying taxes on the assets you sell and transfer. Performance weighting is a rebalancing strategy that involves selling shares from a high-performing fund and buying shares in your lowest-performing fund. While it seems counterintuitive, it follows the principal that funds tend to bounce back. You can think of this as adhering to the general stock investment strategy of buying low and selling high. You typically can buy more shares in a lower-performing fund, so you'll realize a greater return when it bounces back. Rebalancing your portfolio in this way will put you further ahead in the long-term than other strategies. When investing in mutual funds, discipline and self-control are important for healthy long-term returns. If you are impatient and trade frequently, chasing high-performance funds and large gains, you end up costing yourself a lot of money. Ultimately, anyone can be a successful investor, and mutual funds are a great investment vehicle for beginning investors. However, you must have a plan to invest and the discipline to stick to that plan. Avoid making decisions based on emotions or out of desperation. If you are questioning your motives for making an investment decision, talk to an advisor who can be objective. Typically, mutual funds will bounce back from a downturn, so it's not necessarily a good strategy to dump a mutual fund just because it performs poorly in the short-term. However, If a fund has taken an overall downward trend for awhile, it may be time to let it go. You also should watch out for funds that change managers, especially if this happens suddenly. Different managers may have different strategies that could significantly affect performance. Be on the lookout for changes that mean the fund at present has changed character so much that it's no longer the same fund in which you originally invested. Replace it with a fund that more closely matches your original goal for that fund within your portfolio.","completion":"When you get a paper in January, it tells you how your money is doing in something called mutual funds. It's like you put your money in different pockets, and these pockets can grow or shrink. You can move your money around to make it even again in all pockets. This can be good for you in the long run, like when you're much older. But you have to be patient and not make quick decisions just because of feelings. Sometimes, if one pocket is doing very bad, you might want to move away from it. And watch out if the people managing the pockets change, because it can change how they work. It's important to keep your money in pockets that help you and your goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The Fed After Ben: Janet Yellen, The Challenge Of Tapering And A Bloated 3.6 Trillion Balance Sheet The Fed has been the dominant market player since the 2008 financial crisis that brought the global economy to its knees, having taken its balance sheet past 3.6 trillion in its attempts to jumpstart growth. The end of Chairman Ben Bernanke’s tenure marks the moment in which the Fed will have to begin to cut back on its asset purchase programs, or QE, while telegraphing to market participants that it is not tightening monetary policy. A monumental task for Janet Yellen, who will be the first person in history to unwind such extraordinary levels of monetary accommodation. Janet Yellen (Photo credit: Wikipedia) Earlier in 2013, Ben Bernanke first informed markets that he foresaw conditions to taper QE, potentially ending the asset purchase program in mid-2014 as the labor market strengthened and the economic recovery continued. What ensued was sheer panic, as financial conditions tightened dramatically, particularly in the housing market where mortgage rates jumped, forcing the Fed to backtrack to assure investors it wasn’t letting go. This will be the Fed’s challenge in 2014: figuring out how to taper without spooking the market. Yellen has already made it clear that her intention is to strengthen the Fed’s communication through its forward guidance. According to Barclays Barclays’ Peter Newland, the idea is how to manage monetary policy once asset purchases, which the market has latched on to, have concluded. The focus will be on developing a forward guidance that will keep the front end of the yield curve anchored, Nomura’s fixed income research team explains, trying to differentiate tapering from tightening. The latest round of FOMC minutes revealed Fed participants struggling with QE, weighing different options to taper as markets become frothy. Both Bernanke and Yellen have spoken of lowering the unemployment rate threshold, currently at 6.5%, but the consensus seems to be that the FOMC prefers “qualitative” to “quantitative” means of communication, in order to avoid pushing itself into a corner. The economy is expected to accelerate next year, as the fiscal drag caused by continuous political battles in Washington dissipates, and as businesses and households see their balance sheets repaired in the aftermath of the crisis. Nomura expects 2.7% growth in the first half of 2014, and 3% for H2 and following year. Home prices should rise between 4% and 5% in 2014, and then 3% 4% onward, while the unemployment rate should slide to 7% by the end of next year, they explained. The labor market will play a major role in the Fed’s timing. Tapering is set to happen, indeed Barclays’ Newman expects QE to be concluded in the second half of 2014, yet the Fed needs to see substantial improvement in labor markets that is self sustaining. The summer tightening of financial conditions put a face to the downside risks to the Fed’s outlook, as higher rates will harm sectors like housing and autos which have carried the recovery, as shares in KB Home, Toll Brothers, GM, and Ford show. The Fed will keep a watchful eye on the unemployment rate, but will also be looking at the participation rate in order to gauge how much slack remains in labor markets. Barclays’ research suggests the unemployment rate is a pretty good measure of the labor market, while Nomura notes the job market will begin to tighten, as they expect non-farm payrolls to hit a rate of 205,000 per month by the end of next year. Under Chairman Bernanke, the Fed has opened up to an unprecedented degree, giving detailed reports of its decisions. This policy has acted as a double-edged sword, giving quantitative easing a lot of power as the market anticipated the Fed’s flood of cheap money. Yet it has also had the unintended consequence of tying the market’s expectation of Fed tightening to the pace of QE. A move to more “qualitative” thresholds to determine the path of monetary policy should give the 2015 Fed greater control over market expectations. According to Nomura, the first increase in the Federal Funds rate should come in early 2016. The stage is set. Market participants are already anticipating the end of QE, and it is all but confirmed that Janet Yellen will be in charge to supervise the beginning of the end of the post-financial crisis Fed. Bernanke has repeated constantly that the FOMC has the tools and expertise to manage an exit strategy, yet this has never been attempted before. Bernanke’s own first steps were met with wild swings in interest rates that spooked the Fed. By offsetting the taper with stronger forward guidance, the Yellen Fed will begin to chart its own course.","completion":"As the Federal Reserve's balance sheet has grown past 3.6 trillion, it faces the challenge of tapering its asset purchase programs without tightening monetary policy and spooking the market. Janet Yellen, who is set to replace Ben Bernanke, plans to strengthen the Fed's communication through forward guidance to manage monetary policy after asset purchases are concluded. The economy is expected to accelerate as fiscal drag decreases, with estimated growth of 2.7% in the first half of 2014, 3% for the second half, and the following year. The Federal Reserve will closely watch the labor market to time its tapering, with a focus on unemployment and participation rates."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barry Lamar Bonds (born July 24, 1964) is an American former professional baseball left fielder who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants. Bonds received seven NL MVP awards and 14 All-Star selections, and is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Can we infer the following? Bonds received more all-star selections than any other award.","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided, we can infer that Barry Bonds received more All-Star selections than any other award during his career as a professional baseball player. Bonds played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants and was a prominent figure in the world of baseball. Over the course of his career, Bonds received a total of 7 National League (NL) MVP (Most Valuable Player) awards. This prestigious recognition is given to the best performing player in the National League, and receiving this award 7 times signifies Bonds' remarkable talent and sustained excellence in the sport. Nevertheless, this number is considerably less than the 14 All-Star selections he earned. An All-Star selection refers to being chosen to play in the MLB All-Star Game, which is organized annually as a showcase of the top players in the league. These selections are made by fans, players, and managers, and being selected highlights a player's strong performance and popularity during that season. In Bonds' case, his 14 All-Star selections show that he was consistently recognized as one of the leading players of his time by various stakeholders in the baseball community, not just in his league but across the entire MLB. This number is double the 7 MVP awards he earned, making it evident that Bonds received more All-Star selections than any other award during his career. In conclusion, Barry Bonds is considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time, due, in part, to his numerous accolades, which include 7 NL MVP awards and 14 All-Star selections. Among these distinctions, All-Star selections stand out as the most frequently given honor, showcasing Bonds' exceptional talent and enduring success in Major League Baseball."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When I was seven years old, my family created one. First, we put clean sand in a thin glass box and put the ants into it. Soon they got to work making tunnels. I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. With my mom's help, I kept a record of what happened each day and named the ants. One day when I had put my face close to the structure (building), accidentally I knocked it over, and all the tunnels fell in. Although the ants survived their earthquake, one by one they began to die. I was frightened as I watched them give up their tunnel-building to carry the bodies to a corner of the farm. My mother reported that the ants were dying of \\"frustration \\". They simply could not stand the reality that their tunnels had been destroyed. Although much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Over the years, I came to realize the ants have the spirit of teamwork. Working together, they were able to create an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work. Day in and day out, each worked at their task. The ant farm showed that teamwork and perseverance are indeed the keys to success. But there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently --Adversity is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, humans cannot give up when they face disappointment. So I try to live my life like those hardworking ants. But, unlike them, I try not to let frustration defeat me.

(2). There are many reasons you might need to evacuate your home with your bug-out barrel; these include natural disasters such as hurricanes or floods, man-made disasters such as chemical spills, and an invasion by hostile forces.. Answer:","completion":"(2). There are many reasons you might need to evacuate your home with your bug-out barrel; these include natural disasters such as hurricanes or floods, man-made disasters such as chemical spills, and an invasion by hostile forces. Natural disasters are unpredictable and may cause significant damage, displacing you from your home. Hurricanes, for example, can cause substantial wind and water damage, while floods can inundate homes and make them uninhabitable. Earthquakes, tornadoes, wildfires, and other severe weather events can also necessitate evacuation, potentially rendering your home unsafe for occupancy. In such cases, having a bug-out barrel containing essentials such as non-perishable food, water, clothing, and first aid supplies can be extremely beneficial, allowing you to quickly and efficiently leave your home and survive until you can return or find alternative shelter. Man-made disasters, such as chemical spills, can similarly force you to evacuate your home. Industrial accidents, transportation accidents (e.g., tanker truck or train derailments), or even terrorist attacks can result in the release of hazardous chemicals, putting your health and safety at risk. In some instances, local authorities may issue a shelter-in-place order, while in others, they may recommend that residents evacuate to avoid exposure to toxic substances. Here again, having a bug-out barrel prepared allows you to respond quickly to these situations, minimizing potential exposure and adverse health effects. Invasion by hostile forces could range from military invasions (which are likely rare in most locations) to widespread civil unrest, looting, and vandalism during periods of societal breakdown or collapse. Although invasion by hostile forces is arguably the least likely reason for needing to evacuate your home with your bug-out barrel, it emphasizes the importance of being prepared for a wide range of possible scenarios. Having essential supplies and an evacuation plan can be crucial in ensuring your safety and well-being during such events. In conclusion, various situations might necessitate evacuating your home with your bug-out barrel, including natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, and so forth), man-made disasters (chemical spills), and invasions by hostile forces. Preparing for such events by assembling a bug-out barrel and having an evacuation plan in place can help you protect yourself and your family, giving you a better chance of survival during these challenging scenarios."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: Every weekend around the UK, in spacious private houses and mansions, champagne flows, music throbs and guests are bathed in soft gentle light. These aren't A-list events but the latest generation of 'posh orgies', according to a new Channel 4 documentary, Sex Party Secrets airing tonight. Welcome to the world of the sexual elite where the proclivities detailed in erotic novels like Fifty Shades Of Grey aren't just the stuff of fiction. Scroll down for video. A new generation of orgies is springing up in which young, professional couples join invite-only sex events. Forget tales of wife-swapping in Suburbia, these bashes are for young, attractive and professional couples seeking extra thrills in a sophisticated setting. They take place in expensive townhouses, sprawling West Country mansions or even on yachts or villas in Ibiza. Forget Christian Grey's red room of pain, at Pure Pleasure Parties in Spain's clubbing capital, there's a 'human jigsaw room', consisting of a 'giant bed where it's all happening', says organiser Louise. Guests must pass a strict vetting procedure and are largely, young, professional with impeccable grooming habits - if there is a dress code it would involve having Brazilian bikini waxes. Chris Reynolds Gordon runs Heaven Circle, which organises exclusive orgies where the guest list is as strict as any private members club. While thousands of people apply to join there are only 90 members. He says: 'It's becoming way more open, I don't want to use the word trendy, but it's quite the thing to do at the moment.' Sexual safety is paramount at these events and condoms - in various sizes - are laid on for guests. 'You say to your friends, by the way me and my girlfriend went off and did that. They will probably say \\"oh that's weird we do the same thing\\"' Asked why he started creating his own events he says, 'I've been to other parties and I thought I can do better than this.' He admits he didn't want middle aged people people at his parties. 'We've had actors, actresses, models to nurses lawyers, teachers, old school mates even.' One event featured in the programme is held in a £30million London townhouse complete with a hot tub and stuccoed 18th-century stone staircase. Anonymous party-goers talking to the camera wear Venetian masks but even they can't disguise the women's cut glass accents and model cheekbones. The men show off muscled torsos, shaved chests and hipster haircuts. Another organiser Jon Blue looks like a fashion designer with his bleached hair, dapper headgear and waspish sense of humour. Instead he runs invite-only orgies, set in beautiful country piles where clinches take place in four-poster beds and on vast manicured lawns. He says: 'Here we have VIP room where we have the lovely food and champagne for people who have paid a little extra.' 'This is someone's home which is obviously different to hiring a venue like a club because you have to have a little more respect.' Increasing numbers of couples are spicing up their sex lives at controlled events filled with people like them. 'They're lovely owners, very chilled and enjoying the whole spectacle.' 'The idea is that we will have lots of flamboyant spectacle creatures, the theme is mythology, so we're going to have a mermaid in the pool and a unicorn.' 'Basically we open up the house and the play rooms are open and hopefully by that stage we've got their juices flowing and their passion built up and there's a collective arousal.' Mr Blue's goal is to create an entirely new, exotic environment in which to spice up their sex lives either with each other or a variety of partners. 'Most people don't have to have sex on a bed, you could have it on a couch, the corner of a couch, there's plenty of bed space. But the idea of my parties is it’s more a beautiful party, where there's sex possible.' Meanwhile Pure Pleasure Parties take the old fashioned orgy into the rarified environment of private villas and yachts in Ibiza. The events are so popular they're attended by up to 250 people. Louise, the tanned, up-front woman behind the adults-only business says, 'We have parties in yachts as well as villa parties and mansion parties. For the ones in Ibiza you have a 15-strong dance show. 'The things that are different about my parties are that they really are for the elite. The phones are taken off people on the door. There is no chance of being filmed at these parties whatever your position you are safe and secure.' She says: 'We are not born to be with one partner for all our life. Come to a party, live out your fantasies together or let your guy go off and do what a man needs to do.' Dressing up in strappy heels, sexy underwear with trimmed and waxed bikini lines is de rigeur at these events. Sandy and Poppy, first timers at a Heaven Circle, described the thrill of being accepted to the select group as being 'awesome'. On arrival at the event's chic six-bedroom town house, the pair sipped Champagne and watched 'an orgy with five couples all on the same bed all having sex in several different positions.' Another married couple Charlotte and Frank are sex party regulars. She says: 'My husband likes to see me having fun with other men.' Frank adds: 'I just get extremely turned on because I know what the other chap is feeling. When we come back afterwards we are just buzzing and bouncing off the walls from the evening that's just happened.' 'On the way back from a party we usually have to stop on route and get in the back of the car and have some fun. We have sex again on the way home.' Books like Fifty Shades Of Grey have helped bring alternative sexual practices into the mainstream.","completion":"A new Channel 4 documentary called \\"Sex Party Secrets\\" talks about the latest generation of 'posh orgies' happening in the UK.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of the people who comprise The Soggy Bottom Boys? In 1937 Mississippi during the Great Depression, three convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete Hogwallop, and Delmar O'Donnell, escape from a chain gang and set out to retrieve a supposed treasure Everett buried, before its locale is flooded to make a lake and provide electricity for the state. The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway. He tells them, among other prophecies, that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. After Pete angrily blows up Cooley's police van, Wash's son helps them escape. Pete and Delmar are baptized by a group of Christians at a river. The group then picks up Tommy Johnson, a young black man, who claims he has sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit. The trio inadvertently fall in with bank robber George \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson, and help him with a heist, before he leaves them with his share of the loot. The next day, the group hears singing. They see three ladies washing clothes in a river and singing. The ladies drug them with corn liquor and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete's clothes lying next to him, empty except for a toad. Delmar is convinced the ladies were Sirens and transformed Pete into the toad. Later, one-eyed Bible salesman Big Dan Teague invites them for a picnic lunch, then mugs them and kills the toad.

Corectările voturilor şi intenţiile de vot: a se vedea procesul-verbal Translate to English","completion":"Vote Corrections and Voting Intentions: See the Minutes The phrase in Romanian, \\"Corecțările voturilor și intențiile de vot: a se vedea procesul-verbal,\\" can be translated into English as \\"Vote corrections and voting intentions: see the minutes.\\" This statement likely belongs to a larger context, such as a discussion held during a formal meeting or event, where voting took place. To further elaborate: \\"Vote corrections\\" refers to the process of rectifying any errors or inaccuracies that may have occurred during the voting and vote-counting process. These corrections ensure that the results accurately represent the group's decision or opinion, based on the majority rule. Vote corrections can involve recounting the votes, double-checking names and tallies, or resolving any disputes related to the voting process. \\"Voting intentions\\" are the plans or preferences of a voter on which option, item, or candidate they would like to vote for during an election or similar decision-making event. Voting intentions can change over time due to various external influences, such as discussions, debates, and media coverage. These intentions can play a crucial role in shaping the opinions and decisions of other voters and formulating strategies for candidates or parties involved in the election. Lastly, \\"see the minutes\\" is a reference to the written record of a particular meeting or event, known as the minutes. Minutes typically include a summary of the topics discussed, decisions made, and any voting activities that took place during the meeting. They are usually written and maintained by a designated person—often a secretary or administrative professional—and serve as the official documentation of the outcomes and results of the meeting. In conclusion, the translated phrase \\"Vote corrections and voting intentions: see the minutes\\" helps to emphasize the importance of accurate vote counting, understanding voters' intentions, and maintaining a reliable written record of meetings and decision-making processes.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House.

As election day approaches, the political environment in the country becomes increasingly competitive, with each party showcasing their unique plans and reforms, aiming to capture the ever-elusive undecided voter segment. The Premier's party has a history of strong leadership, efficient governance, and a remarkable ability to foster diverse relationships through collaboration and communication with an array of stakeholders. Hence, the party's robust track record stands as a testament to its capability to tackle significant national challenges and deliver on its ambitious long-term goals and policy objectives. Without a doubt, the leader's resolute confidence in his party's strengths and potential is as much a strategic move as it is genuine optimism. By affirming his belief in victory, the Premier aims to inculcate a positive outlook within his party members, galvanizing them into greater efforts to eliminate any voter doubts and garner widespread support. Furthermore, the Premier's statement can be seen as an escalatory approach to confronting the competition, a rallying cry designed to assert his party's standing as the credible choice for the people. In response to the prevailing poll deficit, the Premier and his party continue to fine-tune their campaign message, ensuring that it resonates and appeals to the diverse needs of the citizens. To that end, the Premier has expanded on the relevance of their campaign's policy initiatives, which encompass key areas such as economic growth, healthcare improvements, education reform, and infrastructure development. In a bid to solidify their electoral base and entice undecided voters, the party has gone to great lengths to highlight their substantial achievements and demonstrated success in these sectors. Moreover, the Premier is keen to highlight the contrast between his party's leadership qualities and its opponents' perceived lack of competence and efficiency. By drawing attention to their political rivals' weaker track record and organizational capacities, the Premier fosters a narrative that establishes his party as the ultimate solution to the nation's pressing needs. Meticulous voter research, targeted outreach, and collaborative efforts with local constituencies will be pivotal for consolidating support and securing a successful outcome for the party. The Premier and his team remain undeterred in their quest to overturn the poll deficit and secure a victory that would enable them to steer the country on a progressive path. As the election progresses, it remains to be seen how effectively the Premier's party can sway undecided voters and instill confidence in their leadership, ultimately overcoming the poll deficit. What cannot be disputed, however, is the Premier's unyielding belief and conviction in his party's ability to deliver on their promises and chart a prosperous future for the people. In summary, the Polish Premier's unwavering confidence in his party's ability to overturn the poll deficit and secure victory in the election is bolstered by a combination of factors, including their strong leadership, consistent policy achievements, and an unflagging commitment to addressing the country's challenges. This conviction may set the stage for a fierce yet fascinating showdown as the election day draws near, with the Premier's party determined to prove their political prowess and emerge as the nation's democratic choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \\"atom L\\" and the smaller one \\"atom S\\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Is the shielding effect in atom S higher or lower than in atom L? Hint: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the shielding effect in atom S (the smaller atom) is lower than in atom L (the larger atom). As described in the hint, the ionization energies generally decrease from top to bottom within a group due to the increase in the size of the atoms. In larger atoms, the valence electron is further from the nucleus and experiences a weaker attractive force. This is because the shielding effect increases as more inner electrons are present in larger atoms, which shield the valence electron from the nucleus's attractive force. In contrast, smaller atoms like atom S have fewer inner electrons, resulting in a lower shielding effect. Consequently, the valence electron is closer to the nucleus in a smaller atom and subjected to stronger attractive forces, leading to higher ionization energies. Therefore, the shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

We need to find out the value of \\"n\\" to make everything even. Now let's solve it step by step: 1. We have 2687 * n and 2666 * n, both with the same \\"n\\", so we can subtract them. (2687 - 2666) * n. 2. Subtracting the numbers: 21 * n. So now we have: 0 = 21 * n - 147. 3. To make it easier, let's add 147 to both sides: 147 = 21 * n. 4. Finally, let's find \\"n\\" by dividing both sides by 21: n = 147 ÷ 21. 5. When we divide 147 by 21, we get 7. So, n = 7. And that's it! In this math problem, n equals 7.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on.

Joe studied alkanes, while his friend Vic studied other acyclic hydrocarbons. Which friend studied less about the boiling points of alkanes? Hint: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. A:","completion":"To determine which friend studied less about the boiling points of alkanes, let's analyze the information given in the prompt and the hint. Step 1: Identify the type of hydrocarbons each friend studied. - Vic studied other acyclic hydrocarbons (not alkanes) - Joe studied alkanes Step 2: Analyze what the hint tells us. - Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes. - The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. - Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. Step 3: Compare the subjects studied by each friend. - Since Joe studied alkanes, he learned about boiling points of alkanes directly. - Vic, on the other hand, studied other acyclic hydrocarbons that are not alkanes, so he didn't focus on alkanes' boiling points. Conclusion: Based on this information, Vic studied less about the boiling points of alkanes compared to Joe, as his focus was on other acyclic hydrocarbons."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

'Barwick Green' is the theme tune to which radio serial?","completion":"\\"Barwick Green\\" is the iconic theme tune to the long-running British radio serial \\"The Archers.\\" The Archers, which started airing on January 1, 1951, is a captivating drama set in the fictional rural village of Ambridge. It is broadcast on BBC Radio 4, making it not only the UK's longest-running radio soap opera but also one of the world's most enduring serials. The music of \\"Barwick Green\\" is a prime example of a maypole dance, invoking the essence of idyllic English countryside life. It was composed by Arthur Wood in 1924 as part of his suite \\"My Native Heath\\" and has been used as the theme tune for The Archers from the very beginning of the series. The title \\"Barwick Green\\" is derived from the village of Barwick-in-Elmet in West Yorkshire, where Wood found his inspiration for the piece. The Archers has consistently gained popularity, with its intriguing stories revolving around the relationships, dilemmas, and events in Ambridge. The show has evolved with changing times, addressing modern agricultural challenges, social issues, and both national and international occurrences. Today, it is considered a British institution, with millions of listeners tuning in weekly to follow the lives of the characters. Since The Archers was originally devised as an \\"everyday tale of country folk,\\" the upbeat and pastoral \\"Barwick Green\\" perfectly complements the show's essence by creating a distinct atmosphere. The theme tune has become ingrained in the hearts and minds of devoted listeners, making it instantly recognizable and nearly as beloved as the show itself.

I couldn't decide if I wanted to drink cognac tonight, but when my choices were between cognac and beer, I stayed cheap and picked","completion":"beer, because there were several factors that influenced my decision-making process. Firstly, cost played a crucial role in my selection. Cognac, being a distilled spirit that undergoes a meticulous aging process, is often more expensive compared to beer, which is brewed on a large scale and available at comparatively affordable prices. Knowing that I had a limited budget, it was more pragmatic to opt for the cheaper option so I could still satisfy my desire for an enjoyable drink without breaking the bank. Secondly, I considered the social setting and the company I was sharing the evening with. Beer, in general, is a more casual and popular choice in informal gatherings, and its lower alcohol content meant that I could engage in conversations and enjoy the company of my friends for a longer period without getting excessively inebriated. Cognac, on the other hand, is often considered a more sophisticated and elegant drink, which might have been less suitable in a relaxed, friendly environment. Moreover, I took into account the taste and preferences of not only myself, but also the people around me. While I do enjoy the rich, complex flavors of cognac, I know that not everyone shares the same preferences. Beer offers a wide range of flavors and styles – from light and crisp lagers to full-bodied ales and stouts – making it more likely that everyone in the group would find a type of beer that suits their taste. Thus, opting for beer ensured a more inclusive and enjoyable experience for everyone involved. Furthermore, the availability of beer in numerous venues added to its accessibility and convenience. Whether at a bar, restaurant, or even just a grocery store, beer is almost ubiquitously available, making it an easily attainable option regardless of where I found myself during the evening. Cognac, in contrast, may only be stocked in selected venues or premium liquor stores, rendering it a less convenient choice overall. Lastly, I took into consideration the food I planned to consume during the evening. Beer pairs exceptionally well with a variety of dishes, from savory appetizers to hearty main courses. The carbonation in the beer helps to cleanse the palate between bites, while its diverse flavor profiles can complement or contrast the flavors of different dishes. Cognac, as a sipping spirit, may not have provided the same versatility in accompanying the meal, and therefore beer was a more suitable choice in this regard. In conclusion, after weighing the various factors like cost, social setting, taste preferences, accessibility, and food pairing, I ultimately decided to stay cheap and picked beer as my drink of choice for the evening. It offered a more affordable, versatile, and inclusive option that allowed me and my companions to relax, indulge in our preferred flavors, and enjoy a great time together."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A week later, he attacked the village of Imafuku with 1,500 men, against a defending force of 600. With the aid of a squad wielding arquebuses, the shogunate forces claimed another victory. Several more small forts and villages were attacked before the siege of Osaka Castle itself began on 4 December. The Sanada-maru was an earthwork barbican defended by Sanada Yukimura and 7,000 men, on behalf of the Toyotomi. The Shogun's armies were repeatedly repelled, and Sanada and his men launched a number of attacks against the siege lines, breaking through thrice. Ieyasu then resorted to artillery as well as men to dig under the walls. On 22 January the Winter Siege was ended, with Toyotomi Hideyori pledging to not rise in rebellion. He also allowed Ieyasu to tear down the walls of the outer layer of defenses, and fill in the outer moat of Osaka Castle. Based on the above article, answer a question.

On the same day peace delegates met at the United Nations in Switzerland on Monday to talk again about how they want calm to come to Syria, European Union nations agreed Monday to end an arms embargo against Syrian rebels, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague said. \\"It was a difficult decision for some countries, but it was necessary and right to reinforce international efforts to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Syria,\\" he said in a written statement. The violence continued in the war-torn nation as bloody children were rushed into a dirty makeshift clinic in the Syrian city of Qusayr. Qusayr, near the border with Lebanon, is a strategic area where food, medicine and other supplies are hustled along routes used by government fighters and those trying to oust the government. CNN talked via Skype on Monday with a citizen journalist who described a desperate and horrid situation. The main hospital in Qusayr has been obliterated by fighting, the source said, not wishing to be named out of concern for security. The wounded are being crammed into homes. And, as one YouTube video shows, they apparently being treated at a makeshift clinic. CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video. It's hard to watch. A boy wearing a purple shirt comes in screaming, his head bloody. The camera closes in on a baby. The child wails as people holding a steel instrument trying to dislodge something from the child's ear. The walls are smeared with blood. Catherine Ashton, EU High representative, announced the end of the embargo, reading a declaration from the organization's Foreign Affairs Council. Part of it states: \\"With regard to the possible export of arms to Syria, the Council took note of the commitment by Member States to proceed in their national policies as follows: The sale, supply, transfer or export of military equipment or of equipment which might be used for internal repression will be for the Syrian National Coalition for Opposition and Revolutionary Forces and intended for the protection of civilians.\\" In Geneva, the United Nations' human rights commissioner spoke as she has several times before during the two-year war in Syria. Navi Pillay, in opening remarks at the first session of the U.N. Human Rights Council's three-week conference, said the situation has deteriorated to an \\"intolerable affront to the human conscience,\\" and the International Criminal Court must mete out justice to those who've violated the rights of Syrians. \\"I feel utter dismay,\\" she said. Read Navi Pillay's full remarks to the rights council. Pillay reminded listeners that the war in Syria began in March 2011 as a peaceful demonstration against President Bashar al-Assad and has devolved into a complicated bloodbath of sect battles and terrorist fighters. \\"Whenever their governments cannot or will not protect them, frightened human beings are dependent on the international community for protection and assistance,\\" she said. \\"We cannot -- we must not -- continue to ignore their plea.\\" Amid the backdrop of the Geneva conference came word that Sen. John McCain was inside Syria on Monday and met with rebels, making him the highest ranking U.S. official to visit during the war. The senator's communications director, Brian Rogers, confirmed the trip. Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director for the Washington-based Syrian Emergency Task Force, said McCain met with 18 commanders of the Free Syrian Army about 1 kilometer from the border with Turkey in northern Syria. \\"Their main message was that we are desperate for ammunition, we are desperate for weapons,\\" Moustafa said. \\"They are confident that if the weapons are given to the supreme military council, that it will not fall in the wrong hands.\\" McCain met with the commanders, which included the top leader of the rebel force, for about an hour. It's often difficult to discern exactly what is happening Syria because al-Assad has made it difficult if not deadly for foreign journalists to enter the nation. A state TV reporter, Yara Abbas, was killed in Qusayr on Monday, according to Syria state television. She died after \\"terrorists targeted\\" a state TV crew near al-Dabaa airport north of the strategic city near Lebanon, where rebels and government forces run supply routes. In Geneva, Pillay talked about Qusayr. \\"I am extremely concerned at current reports suggesting that hundreds of civilians have been killed or injured, and thousands may remain trapped, by indiscriminate shelling and aerial attacks by government forces in Al Qusayr,\\" Pillay said. Safe passage must be given to any civilians wishing to leave.\\" Outside reports indicate rebels continue to fight for the cause that began the unrest: ousting al-Assad and allowing Syrians greater freedom, something akin to the goals of the wider Arab Spring movement. Those who want al-Assad gone claim that the president has ordered his forces to slay families and indiscriminately shell neighborhoods across the country, which is about the size of Washington state. Al-Assad says his forces are trying to save the country from \\"terrorists.\\" \\"These war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot be allowed to go unpunished,\\" Pillay told delegates from around the world. \\"We must make it clear to both (the Assad government) and the armed opposition groups that there will be consequences for those responsible. And the world must take action to end this terrible conflict.\\" Pillay's remarks came as U.S. Secretary John Kerry met in Paris with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The two diplomats spoke briefly to reporters Monday before heading off to a private dinner with the French foreign minister. Kerry expressed concern about any possible use of chemical weapons and the need to determine what is happening on the ground, while Lavrov stressed the situation in Syria isn't getting any better and that he wants to do everything in his power to stop the bloodshed. For months during the Syrian war, Russia appeared to be supporting al-Assad. But that tide may be turning, at least gaining some wiggle room for the Russians to help broker an end to the violence. CNN's Security Clearance: Russia blasts Obama's recognition of rebels. U.S. officials want to start talks between the government and groups that want al-Assad gone. But not everyone involved in Syria wants to engage. The Syrian National Council, based in Istanbul, is part of the main opposition umbrella group and is considered to be composed of hardliners who've said they'll never talk or negotiate with anyone representing the Assad regime. The group was having meetings over the weekend in Istanbul to consider attending the Geneva conference. Syrian National Coalition spokesman Louay Safi said the group wants to hear \\"more clarity about the purpose and the intentions of the Syrian regime. \\"So far,\\" he said, \\"the signals have been not positive.\\" At the start of May, the U.N.'s point man on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, called Lavrov and Kerry's cooperation to forge a solution to the Syrian conflict \\"the first hopeful news concerning that unhappy country in a very long time.\\" Lavrov told Foreign Policy recently that the United States and Russia have a lot in common. Asked about his \\"famously contentious relationship\\" with Bush administration Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Lavrov laughed. \\"Well, I don't engage in comparing my partners,\\" he said. \\"John Kerry is a professional. He is pragmatic. And this is a very important quality for a diplomat and especially for a secretary of state. \\"He has very good knowledge of things around the world. He has keen interest in moving some of the old problems out of the deadlock.\\" Lavrov also was asked about Kerry's criticism that Russia is still selling weapons to Syria. \\"Well, you know on the arms sales, we never, we never tried to hide that we are implementing the contracts which have been signed quite some time ago, long before all this started,\\" he answered, saying his country has provided Syria with defensive weapons. \\"We have been consistent,\\" he told Foreign Policy. \\"We have been saying that for us priority No. 1 is to stop the bloodshed and to save lives, and therefore cessation of hostilities and dialogue without any preconditions is the best way to achieve this desired goal.\\" While diplomats talked, on Monday at least 35 people were killed in Syria, including two women and two children, according to the opposition group Local Coordination Committees in Syria.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better. Instead of what should be a gripping, tense story of a boy's fight for survival in the wilderness, it comes off as a National Geographic documentary meets Columbia sportswear ad. The film begins with Brian (Jared Rushton) preparing for a journey by plane to see his father. His mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going-away gift (what's wrong with a Rubik's Cube?), little knowing how badly he will soon need it. Once in the air, the plane's pilot (a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo by Ned Beatty) suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving Brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake. Extremely lucky to walk (or rather swim) away virtually unscathed, Brian must find shelter, food and hope for rescue. Here is where the main problem with the movie begins. By the very nature of Brian's solitude, Jared has very few lines to speak, and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene. Instead, he is shown walking around, sitting around, and so on, with only a minimal sense of danger. As a result, too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents' troubled marriage as the source of tension. These scenes merely get in the way and don't particularly add much to the story. Even worse, occasionally Jared  his face covered with mud - lets out a primal scream or two, which conjures up unfortunate parallels to \`Predator.' Speaking of unfortunate, we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet, but it presumably helped keep him warm at night. Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother. Both she and the father have very little impact in the movie. For instance, we are never shown how they react to news of Brian's disappearance, how they might be organizing rescue attempts, and so on. This is just one source of tension the film-makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before Brian embarked on his journey. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment and points out several issues with the movie, such as lack of tension, ineffective performances, and unexplored sources of tension."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Information: - In biology, a species complex is a group of closely related species that are very similar in appearance to the point that the boundaries between them are often unclear. Terms sometimes used synonymously but with more precise meanings are: cryptic species for two or more species hidden under one species name, sibling species for two cryptic species that are each other's closest relative, and species flock for a group of closely related species living in the same habitat. As informal taxonomic ranks, species group, species aggregate, and superspecies are also in use. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) is the set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal botanical names that are given to plants, fungi and a few other groups of organisms, all those \\"traditionally treated as algae, fungi, or plants\\". It was formerly called the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN); the name was changed at the International Botanical Congress in Melbourne in July 2011 as part of the \\"Melbourne Code\\" which replaces the \\"Vienna Code\\" of 2005. As with previous codes, it took effect as soon as it was ratified by the congress (on Saturday 23 July 2011), but the documentation of the code in its final form was not finished until some time after the congressional meeting. Preliminary wording of some of the articles with the most significant changes has been published in September 2011. - Botany, also called plant science(s), plant biology or phytology, is the science of plant life and a branch of biology. A botanist or plant scientist is a scientist who specialises in this field. The term \\"botany\\" comes from the Ancient Greek word (\\"botan\\") meaning \\"pasture\\", \\"grass\\", or \\"fodder\\"; is in turn derived from (\\"boskein\\"), \\"to feed\\" or \\"to graze\\". Traditionally, botany has also included the study of fungi and algae by mycologists and phycologists respectively, with the study of these three groups of organisms remaining within the sphere of interest of the International Botanical Congress. Nowadays, botanists study approximately 400,000 species of living organisms of which some 260,000 species are vascular plants and about 248,000 are flowering plants. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - The plural (abbreviated ), in many languages, is one of the values of the grammatical category of number. Plural of nouns typically denote a quantity other than the default quantity represented by a noun, which is generally one (the form that represents this default quantity is said to be of \\"singular\\" number). Most commonly, therefore, plurals are used to denote two or more of something, although they may also denote more than fractional, zero or negative amounts. An example of a plural is the English word \\"cats\\", which corresponds to the singular \\"cat\\". - Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses. DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins, lipids and complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), they are one of the four major types of macromolecules that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. - FOSSIL is a standard protocol for allowing serial communication for telecommunications programs under the DOS operating system. FOSSIL is an acronym for \\"Fido Opus SEAdog Standard Interface Layer\\". \\"Fido\\" refers to FidoBBS, \\"Opus\\" refers to Opus-CBCS BBS, and \\"SEAdog\\" refers to a Fidonet compatible mailer. The standards document that defines the FOSSIL protocol is maintained by the Fidonet Technical Standards Committee. - In ecology, a niche is a term with a variety of meanings related to the behavior of a species living under specific environmental conditions. The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of resources and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when predators, parasites and pathogens are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey). \\"The type and number of variables comprising the dimensions of an environmental niche vary from one species to another [and] the relative importance of particular environmental variables for a species may vary according to the geographic and biotic contexts\\". - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - In biology, offspring are the young born of living organisms, produced either by a single organism or, in the case of sexual reproduction, two organisms. Collective offspring may be known as a brood or progeny in a more general way. This can refer to a set of simultaneous offspring, such as the chicks hatched from one clutch of eggs, or to all the offspring, as with the honeybee. - Biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms, including their structure, function, growth, evolution, distribution, identification and taxonomy. Modern biology is a vast and eclectic field, composed of many branches and subdisciplines. However, despite the broad scope of biology, there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research, consolidating it into single, coherent field. In general, biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life, genes as the basic unit of heredity, and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species. It is also understood today that all the organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition known as homeostasis. - In biological classification , rank is the relative level of a group of organisms ( a taxon ) in a taxonomic hierarchy . Examples of taxonomic ranks are species , genus , family , class , kingdom , etc. A given rank subsumes under it less general categories , that is , more specific descriptions of life forms . Above it , each rank is classified within more general categories of organisms and groups of organisms related to each other through inheritance of traits or features from common ancestors . The rank of any species and the description of its genus is basic ; which means that to identify a particular organism , it is usually not necessary to specify ranks other than these first two . Consider a particular species , the red fox Vulpes vulpes : its next rank , the genus Vulpes , comprises all the ' true foxes ' . Their closest relatives are in the immediately higher rank , the family Canidae , which includes dogs , wolves , jackals , all foxes , and other caniforms ; the next higher rank , the order Carnivora , includes feliforms and caniforms ( lions , tigers , bears , hyenas , wolverines , and all those mentioned above ) , plus other carnivorous mammals . As one group of the class Mammalia , all of the above are classified among those with backbones in the Chordata phylum rank , and with them among all the animals in the Animalia kingdom rank . Finally , all of the above will find their earliest relatives somewhere in their domain rank Eukarya . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature defines rank as : The level , for nomenclatural purposes , of a taxon in a taxonomic hierarchy ( e.g. all families are for nomenclatural purposes at the same rank , which lies between superfamily and subfamily ) - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - In biology, a taxon (plural taxa; back-formation from \\"taxonomy\\") is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit. Although neither is required, a taxon is usually known by a particular name and given a particular ranking, especially if and when it is accepted or becomes established. It is not uncommon, however, for taxonomists to remain at odds over what belongs to a taxon and the criteria used for inclusion. If a taxon is given a formal scientific name, its use is then governed by one of the nomenclature codes specifying which scientific name is correct for a particular grouping. - Ecdysozoa is a group of protostome animals, including Arthropoda (insects, chelicerata, crustaceans, and myriapods), nematoda, and several smaller phyla. They were first defined by Aguinaldo \\"et al.\\" in 1997, based mainly on phylogenetic trees constructed using 18S ribosomal RNA genes. A large study in 2008 by Dunn \\"et al.\\" strongly supported the Ecdysozoa as a clade, that is, a group consisting of a common ancestor and all its descendants. - In biology, a phylum (plural: phyla) is a taxonomic rank below kingdom and above class. Traditionally, in botany the term division was used instead of \\"phylum\\", although from 1993 the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants accepted the designation \\"phylum\\". Depending on definitions, the kingdom Animalia contains approximately 35 phyla, Plantae contains about 12, and Fungi contains around 7. Current research in phylogenetics is uncovering the relationships between phyla, which are contained in larger clades, like Ecdysozoa and Embryophyta. - Nomenclature codes or codes of nomenclature are the various rulebooks that govern biological taxonomic nomenclature, each in their own broad field of organisms. To an end-user who only deals with names of species, with some awareness that species are assignable to families, it may not be noticeable that there is more than one code, but beyond this basic level these are rather different in the way they work. - In biological classification, subspecies (abbreviated \\"subsp.\\" or \\"ssp.\\"; \\"plural\\": \\"subspecies\\") is either a taxonomic rank subordinate to species, or a taxonomic unit in that rank. A subspecies cannot be recognized independently: a species will either be recognized as having no subspecies at all or at least two (including any that are extinct). - Sexual reproduction is a form of reproduction where two morphologically distinct types of specialized reproductive cells called gametes fuse together, involving a female's large ovum (or egg) and a male's smaller sperm. Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes of normal cells. They are created by a specialized type of cell division, which only occurs in eukaryotic cells, known as meiosis. The two gametes fuse during fertilization to produce DNA replication and the creation of a single-celled zygote which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) joins up so that homologous chromosome sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents, though self-fertilization can occur. For instance, in human reproduction each human cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 pairs, except gamete cells, which only contain 23 chromosomes, so the child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 pairs. Cell division initiates the development of a new individual organism in multicellular organisms, including animals and plants, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction. - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. What entity does 'taxonomic rank' has the relation 'part of' with?

Step 6: max_elem = 50.417 Step 7: Iterate through the remaining elements in the list (2nd element to last). Step 8: Second element is -3.929. Find the absolute value by multiplying it by -1 resulting in 3.929. Compare this to the current max_val (50.417). Since 3.929 is less than 50.417, we keep max_val and max_elem the same. Step 9: Third element is 80.237. Its absolute value is already 80.237. Compare this to the current max_val (50.417). Since 80.237 is greater than 50.417, we update max_val to be 80.237 and max_elem to be 80.237. Step 10: max_val = 80.237 max_elem = 80.237 Step 11: Fourth element is 80.63. Its absolute value is already 80.63. Compare this to the current max_val (80.237). Since 80.63 is greater than 80.237, we update max_val to be 80.63 and max_elem to be 80.63. Step 12: max_val = 80.63 max_elem = 80.63 Step 13: We have now iterated through all elements in the list and found that the element with the highest absolute value is 80.63. Step 14: Return the element with the highest absolute value before applying the absolute value operation, which is 80.63 since it is already a positive number.

Ten people have been killed in the gun battle at the Maka al-Mukarama hotel, including the Somali ambassador to Switzerland, Yusuf Bari Bari. Other diplomats escaped by jumping from windows. US-trained Somali special forces have been able to take back control of most of the hotel. Latest reports say the militants are now on the top floors and the roof, firing guns and throwing grenades. Police officer Major Ismail Olow told Reuters that he believed there were originally nine attackers, six of whom had been killed. The attack began when a suicide bomber detonated his explosives-packed car outside the building. Hotels in Mogadishu are often targeted by al-Shabab militants, who were driven from the city several years ago but still control southern rural areas.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Given the background: Excess intake of calcium may cause hypercalcaemia. However, because calcium is absorbed rather inefficiently by the intestines, high serum calcium is more likely caused by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or possibly by excessive intake of vitamin D, both which facilitate calcium absorption. It may also be due to bone destruction that occurs when tumours metastasize within bone. All these conditions result in excess calcium salts being deposited in the heart, blood vessels, or kidneys. Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, memory loss, confusion, muscle weakness, increased urination, dehydration, and metabolic bone disease. Chronic hypercalcaemia typically leads to calcification of soft tissue and its serious consequences: for example, calcification can cause loss of elasticity of vascular walls and disruption of laminar blood flow—and thence to plaque rupture and thrombosis. Conversely, inadequate calcium or vitamin D intakes may result in hypocalcaemia, often caused also by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone or defective PTH receptors in cells. Symptoms include neuromuscular excitability, which potentially causes tetany and disruption of conductivity in cardiac tissue. and the situation: Two brothers went to the doctor's office for a medical exam and blood tests. Dan found out he is healthy and had normal blood cholesterol and calcium levels. Ben however, was told that he had a disease called hypercalcaemia and had to start a treatment for that.

The correct answer is \\"Iraq\\" because the sentence is discussing the need for the majority within Iraq (the Shia population) to show that they can represent the minority populations within the country. This is in context with the Iraqi election mentioned in the passage. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 1. Americans: The sentence is discussing Iraq's ability, not that of Americans. 2. Arab: This is too vague, and the focus is specifically on Iraq. 3. Baquba: This is a city within Iraq, but the focus is on the whole country. 4. CNN: This is the news network reporting the story, not the subject of the sentence. 5. Fareed Zakaria: He is the analyst speaking about the issue, not the subject of the sentence. 6. Iraqi: This should be \\"Iraq\\" as it's referring to the country, not its people. 7. Middle East: This is the region, but the focus is specifically on Iraq as a country. 8. New York: This is unrelated and is only mentioned as the location of CNN's headquarters. 9.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. Now, I have a new situation: Hill town had two large forests nearby. Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent in Brook forest. Answer this question please: Which forest had fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let us break down the information given and analyze the situation step-by-step. 1. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can tolerate freezing and drying, and their prevalence and diversity vary across environmental gradients. 2. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. This is because plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and the fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these conditions. 3. Environmental conditions can lead to local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi, and soil nutrient concentrations. Now, let's consider the two forests - Lake forest and Brook forest. A. Lake forest has trees in symbiotic relationships with a large variety of AM fungi. B. Brook forest has less prevalence of these fungi in comparison to Lake forest. Given that AM fungi reallocate resources to intraradical hyphae when soil nutrient and moisture concentrations are higher, it can be inferred that the Brook forest has higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. As a result, in Brook forest, the available AM fungi are more likely to reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae than in Lake forest. Therefore, the Brook forest has fewer AM fungi which reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Boone, Ia. -Poor and elderly people may soon go without legal representation in Boone County. Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer. Without that, the program might already be closed. \\"All governments are having problems with finances,\\" Boone Mayor George Maybee said. \\"No one else stepped in. The county didn't. The state didn't.\\" Donovan Olson, chairman of the county Board of Supervisors, said the board quit funding the legal service in July because it felt the county didn't need it. Drake University ended its funding after the 2000 spring semester \\"for a variety of reasons,\\" Suzanne Levitt, the law professor who oversaw the program, said via e-mail. Olson said Schroeder must prove Prairie Meadows is the primary money source for the board to grant the program any more money. Schroeder ran the program without the help of law students or Drake, which had provided as much as two-thirds of the money in some years. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Okay, little buddy, let me explain what's going on here. There's a place called Boone County Legal Aid, which is like a group of helpers that provide something called \\"legal representation\\". That means they help people who have problems with the law and need someone to stand up for them. Now, these helpers are really important, especially for people who don't have a lot of money or are older and need special assistance. The problem is that Boone County Legal Aid might have to close down if they don't get some extra money from a place called Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino. This means the helpers might not be there to help those people in need anymore, and that's really sad. There's a man named Alan Schroeder, who is like the boss of Boone County Legal Aid, and he's been trying very hard to keep it going. He's been using some money from the city and county and even runs his own business. But if Boone County Legal Aid closes down, he doesn't know where the people he helps will go. The city of Boone and a couple of other groups used to give money to help out Boone County Legal Aid, but they can't anymore because they have their own money problems. So, Boone County Legal Aid will need to prove that they really need the money from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino in order to continue helping people.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991. - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal. - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia.

Spanish is official in all of Spain, whereas Valencian is official in the Valencian Country, as well as in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, where it receives the name of Catalan. Despite the differentiated denomination, the distinct dialectal traits and political tension between Catalonia and the Valencian Country, Catalan and Valencian are mutually intelligible and are considered two varieties of the same language. Valencian has been historically repressed in favour of Spanish. The effects have been more noticeable in the city proper, whereas the language has remained active in the rural and metropolitan areas. After the Castille-Aragon unification, a Spanish-speaking elite established itself in the city. In more recent history, the establishment of Franco's military and administrative apparatus in Valencia further excluded Valencian from public life. Valencian recovered its official status, prestige and use in education after the transition to democracy in 1978. However, due to industrialisation in recent decades, Valencia has attracted immigration from other regions in Spain, and hence there is also a demographic factor for its declining social use. Due to a combination of these reasons, Valencia has become the bastion of anti-Catalan blaverism, which celebrates Valencian as merely folkloric, but rejects the existing standard which was adapted from Catalan orthography. Spanish is currently the predominant language in the city proper but, thanks to the education system, most Valencians have basic knowledge of both Spanish and Valencian, and either can be used in the city. Valencia is therefore the second biggest Catalan-speaking city after Barcelona. Institutional buildings and streets are named in Valencian. The city is also home to many pro-Valencian political and civil organisations. Furthermore, education entirely in Valencian is offered in more than 70 state-owned schools in the city, as well as by the University of Valencia across all disciplines.

Despite the occasional successes, he struggles to pay rent and repair his battered 1970s Chevrolet Monte Carlo. He keeps dozens of different animal in his apartment, and his eccentricities make him the laughing stock of the Miami-Dade Police Department. Two weeks before the Miami Dolphins football team is due to play in the Super Bowl, the team mascot, a bottlenose dolphin named Snowflake, is stolen. Besides notifying the police, Melissa Robinson, the team's Chief Publicist, also hires Ace to find Snowflake. Ace discovers a rare triangular-cut orange amber stone, which he speculates to be part of a 1984 AFC Championship Ring. Ace tracks down the players in the team photo and sees their ring, but is dismayed to find every ring intact. Roger Podacter, Miami Dolphins' Head of Operations, mysteriously falls to his death from his apartment. At the crime scene, Miami Police Lieutenant Lois Einhorn concludes the death to be a suicide. However, Ace proves it was a murder, embarrassing and infuriating Einhorn. Ace learns of a former Dolphins player named Ray Finkle, who also owned a ring but did not appear in the team photo, as he was added later in the season. Finkle missed the field goal kick at the end of Super Bowl XVII, which cost the Dolphins the championship and ruined his career.

Since the first two terms both have h as their variable, we can combine them: -51*h + 85*h = 34*h. So, the equation becomes: 34*h - 102 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable, h. To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term (-102) from the left side of the equation. We can achieve this by adding 102 to both sides of the equation: 34*h - 102 + 102 = 0 + 102 34*h = 102 Step 3: Solve for h by dividing by the coefficient of h. Now, we need to isolate h by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of h, which is 34: 34*h / 34 = 102 / 34 h = 3 So, the solution to the equation -51*h + 85*h - 102 = 0 is h = 3."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. Question: \\"What are three reasons for Bin Laden's money troubles when he was based in Sudan?\\" Answer: \\"Personal spendings, higher business operating costs and increased demands from Saudi government\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct but let me explain it in a simpler way for a five-year-old: Bin Laden had money problems in Sudan because he was spending too much on personal things, it cost more to run his businesses there, and the Saudi government was asking for more money from him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Many devices previously provided on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus and PCI Express versions.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) interface is a type of computer bus used for connecting various hardware components within a computer system. It was developed by Intel Corporation and was introduced in the early 1990s as a high-speed expansion bus to replace the older and slower ISA and EISA buses. The purpose of the PCI interface is to allow multiple devices, such as sound cards, network cards, graphics cards, and other peripherals, to communicate simultaneously with the computer's central processing unit (CPU) and memory, thereby enhancing the overall performance and functionality of the computer. The given statement \\"Many devices previously provided on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in universal serial bus (USB) and PCI Express (PCIe) versions.\\" is indeed a reasonable answer to the question. This is because, over time, the PCI interface has evolved, giving rise to newer versions, such as PCI-X (PCI eXtended) and PCI Express (PCIe). PCI Express is the most recent and advanced version, offering higher data transfer rates and more efficient power management compared to its predecessors. Moreover, the integration of various functions and devices built directly into the motherboard has also led to a reduction in the number of PCI slots required. While traditional PCI interfaces may still be in use in some older systems, there has been a considerable shift towards integrating functions directly onto the motherboard, as well as the adoption of USB and PCIe as primary options for connecting peripherals. The prevalence of USB devices, in particular, has moved many peripherals from PCI-based expansion cards to USB-connected solutions, making it easier for users to install and use these devices without requiring opening the computer case or having specialized knowledge of internal computer components. Additionally, PCIe has become the dominant standard for high-performance hardware components such as graphics cards, solid-state drives (SSDs), and network interface cards (NICs), providing higher bandwidth, lower latency, and support for more advanced features. In conclusion, yes, the statement that many devices previously provided on PCI expansion cards are now commonly integrated onto motherboards or available in USB and PCI Express versions is an appropriate answer to the question about the PCI interface. This reflects the evolving nature of computer technology and the continuous quest for improved performance, efficiency, and user convenience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Andrew Lloyd Webber's driver was arrested after being caught stealing the Oscar-winning composer's housekeeping cash. Police were called to the theatre impresario's £15million townhouse in Belgravia, central London, on Thursday and led away his 45-year-old driver in handcuffs. The chauffeur, who was wearing a bright purple tie and navy-blue jacket as he was taken to the police car, has now been sacked, according to Lord Lloyd-Webber's company, Really Useful Group. He was arrested on suspicion of 'theft employee' and taken to a nearby police station where he admitted the offence and accepted a caution. A source told The Sun that hundreds of pounds had gone missing from the composer's mansion in recent weeks. Lord Lloyd-Webber, the theatre impresario behind musicals including Cats and Evita, is worth an estimated £640million and was ranked 162 in The Sunday Times' Rich List last year. His annual profits were boosted by the success of his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory musical, as pre-tax profits of Really Useful Investments were raised to £6.2million to June 2014. The composer's revival of Cats, the musical, starring Nicole Scherzinger is set to extend its West End run with 100,000 extra tickets after 'extraordinary' demand from a new generation of fans. He recently said of the former Pussycat Doll, 'I think she is the real deal, the absolute real deal. 'She is what you might call an American theatre babe. I do believe she is the most exciting musical theatre artist I have found – well, that I have worked with – in very, very many years. I really do.' Lord Lloyd-Webber was recently named among a string of celebrities including David Beckham and Bob Geldof who are facing having to pay the taxman a total of £1billion in a dispute over a suspected tax avoidance scheme. Police were called to the theatre impresario's £15 million townhouse in Belgravia, central London, on Thursday and led away his 45-year-old driver in handcuffs. His annual profits were boosted by the success of his Charlie And The Chocolate Factory musical. The composer told the Sunday Times he was advised that he was being 'almost philanthropic by investing in the British film industry, and that this was a scheme to promote British films', adding: 'At no time did I consider it solely a tax scheme.' He lives in his Belgravia townhouse with his third wife, Madeleine Gurdon, a former equestrian sportswoman. A Met Police spokesman said: 'Police were called to reports of a theft at an address in SW1 at 1.20pm on Thursday 5 February. 'A 45-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft employee and was taken into police custody. He was cautioned and there will not be a court appearance.' Lord Lloyd-Webber's spokesman refused to comment. The composer's revival of Cats, the musical, starring Nicole Scherzinger (pictured with Lewis Hamilton) is set to extend its West End run. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Andrew Lloyd Webber is a very famous music composer who makes great shows like Cats and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Generate a question that has the following answer: lower level managers for the following movie plot: STRIKE ![The plot is based on 1903 events at a locomotive factory in Tsarist Russia, but the costumes and technology seen are from the 1920s.]An initial title card has a quote from Lenin: At the factory, all is quiet.The word BUT (in Russian) is added, the text then animates and dissolves into images of machinery in motion.Silhouettes of workers and machinery glide across the screen showing the daily work routine.We see notes and leaflets being posted or passed furtively, and huddles of workers meeting while hiding from suspervisors, in bathrooms and while swimming in the nearby river.The workers are tired of poor wages, long hours, and harsh treatment by their supervisors,.which triggers a restlessness and strike planning among them.A title card reads \\"discontent is spreading,\\" and next come shots with the stereotypical suited and booted fat director puffing on a cigar.The images illustrate the exploitation of noble hard workers by the lazy cigar-smoking top hatted bourgeoisie.Lower level managers approach a high level police officer with requests for spies, and the officer looks up in files the available spying agents, who have code names of animals according to their appearance and function.A shot of an owl, always watching, thinking and cunning, dissolves into a wild eyed spy.A fox, misleadingly beautiful and sly, dissolves into a handsome con artist.A third spy is similarly compared to a bulldog.In this sequence, docile dancing bears represent the workers.The comment in one of the title frames says the owl-like spy can also see during the day, unlike a real owl, reinforcing the notion that the workers are never safe from the factory owners' spiesThe administration proceeds to employ a number of these secret agents with animal code names to infiltrate and spy on the strikers.A micrometer is stolen, with a value of 25 rubles or 3 weeks of pay.A worker, Yakov, goes to the office to report the theft, but ends up accused of the theft himself.
