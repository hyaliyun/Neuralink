Think like you are answering to a five year old. Irving Kristol, Godfather of Modern Conservatism, Dies at 89 Mr. Kristol translated his concerns into a magazine. In 1965, with a 10,000 contribution from a wealthy acquaintance, he and Daniel Bell started The Public Interest. Its founding is generally considered the beginning of neoconservatism. “Something like a ‘movement’ took shape,” Mr. Kristol wrote, “with The Public Interest at (or near) the center.” The Public Interest writers did not take issue with the ends of the Great Society so much as with the means, the “unintended consequences” of the Democrats’ good intentions. Welfare programs, they argued, were breeding a culture of dependency; affirmative action created social divisions and did damage to its supposed beneficiaries. They placed practicality ahead of ideals. “The legitimate question to ask about any program,” Mr. Kristol said, “is, ‘Will it work?’,” and the reforms of the 1960s and ’70s, he believed, were not working. For more than six decades, beginning in 1942, when he and other recent graduates of City College founded Enquiry: A Journal of Independent Radical Thought, his life revolved around magazines. Besides The Public Interest, Mr. Kristol published, edited and wrote for journals of opinion like Commentary, Encounter, The New Leader, The Reporter and The National Interest. All were “little magazines,” with limited circulations, but Mr. Kristol valued the quality of his readership more than the quantity. “With a circulation of a few hundred,” he once said, “you could change the world.” Small circles and behind-the-scenes maneuverings suited him. He never sought celebrity; in fact, he was puzzled by writers who craved it. Described by the economics writer Jude Wanniski as the “hidden hand” of the conservative movement, he avoided television and other media spotlights; he was happier consulting with a congressman like Jack Kemp about the new notion of supply-side economics and then watching with satisfaction as Mr. Kemp converted President Ronald Reagan to the theory. Mr. Kristol was a man of ideas who believed in the power of ideas, an intellectual whose fiercest battles were waged against other intellectuals. A major theme of The Public Interest under Mr. Kristol’s leadership was the limits of social policy; he and his colleagues were skeptical about the extent to which government programs could actually produce positive change. Neoconservatism may have begun as a dispute among liberals about the nature of the welfare state, but under Mr. Kristol it became a more encompassing perspective, what he variously called a “persuasion,” an “impulse,” a “new synthesis.” Against what he saw as the “nihilistic” onslaught of the ’60s counterculture, Mr. Kristol, in the name of neoconservatism, mounted an ever more muscular defense of capitalism, bourgeois values and the aspirations of the common man that took him increasingly to the right. For him, neoconservatism, with its emphasis on values and ideas, had become no longer a corrective to liberal overreaching but an “integral part” of conservatism and the Republican Party, a challenge to liberalism itself, which, in his revised view, was a destructive philosophy that had lost touch with ordinary people. Neoconservatism maintained a lingering sympathy for certain aspects of Roosevelt’s New Deal, but its focus had shifted to the culture wars and to upholding traditional standards. Liberalism led to “moral anarchy,” Mr. Kristol said, arguing the point with one of his wisecracking encapsulizations: “In the United States today, the law insists that an 18-year-old girl has the right to public fornication in a pornographic movie — but only if she is paid the minimum wage.” Mr. Kristol’s rightward drift, though it brought him new allies like Buckley and Robert Bartley, the head of The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, broke up the original Public Interest family. Mr. Moynihan went on to a celebrated career as a Democratic senator from New York, and Mr. Bell gave up the coeditorship of the magazine in the early ’70s, declaring himself a socialist in economics, a liberal in politics and a conservative in culture. (He was replaced by Nathan Glazer.) But neoconservatism turned quite literally into a family affair for Mr. Kristol. His wife, Gertrude Himmelfarb, a distinguished historian of 19th-century England, wrote books and articles critical of modern permissiveness and urged a return to Victorian values. His son, William, who had been Vice President Dan Quayle’s chief of staff, became a leading spokesman for neoconservatism in his own right as a television commentator, the editor of The Weekly Standard and briefly a columnist for The New York Times. Friends referred to them as America’s first family of neoconservatism. Mr. Kristol’s weapon of choice was the biting polemical essay of ideas, a form he mastered as part of the famed circle of writers and critics known as the New York Intellectuals, among them the ferocious literary brawlers Mary McCarthy and Dwight Macdonald. Mr. Kristol once described feeling intimidated at a cocktail party when he was seated with Ms. McCarthy on one side, Hannah Arendt on the other and Diana Trilling across from him. He learned the hard way that he was not destined to be an author of books. In the late 1950s he spent three months researching a study of the evolution of American democracy, only to abandon the project, he said, once he realized “it was all an exercise in futility.” An attempted novel was consigned to his incinerator. “I was not a book writer,” he said. The four volumes published under his name — “On the Democratic Idea in America” (1972), “Two Cheers for Capitalism” (1978), “Reflections of a Neoconservative” (1983) and “Neoconservatism: The Autobiography of an Idea” (1995) — are collections of previously published articles. As an essayist, Mr. Kristol was sharp, witty, aphoristic and assertive. “Equivocation has never been Irving Kristol’s long suit,” his friend Robert H. Bork said of him. Before achieving his reputation as a writer on political and social affairs, he was a wide-ranging generalist. In the 1940s and ’50s, his subjects included Einstein, psychoanalysis, Jewish humor and the Marquis de Sade. His erudition could burst out at unexpected moments. An attack on environmental extremists uses a quotation from Auden; a passage about American men’s obsession with golf cites T.S. Eliot. But he could be a verbal streetfighter as well. John Kenneth Galbraith, he wrote, “thinks he is an economist and, if one takes him at his word, it is easy to demonstrate that he is a bad one.” After it was revealed that Magic Johnson had tested HIV positive, Mr. Kristol wrote: “He is a foolish, reckless man who does not merit any kind of character reference.” Mr. Kristol seemed to need enemies: the counterculture, the academic and media professionals who made up what he called the New Class, and finally liberalism in its entirety. And he certainly made enemies with his harsh words. Yet underlying the invective was an innate skepticism, even a quality of moderation and self-mockery, which was often belied by his single-mindedness. This stalwart defender of free enterprise could manage only two cheers for capitalism. “Extremism in defense of liberty,” he declared, taking issue with Barry Goldwater, “is always a vice because extremism is but another name for fanaticism.” And the two major intellectual influences on him, he said, were Lionel Trilling, “a skeptical liberal,” and Leo Strauss, “a skeptical conservative.” “Ever since I can remember,” he said in summing himself up, “I’ve been a neo-something: a neo-Marxist, a neo-Trotskyist, a neo-liberal, a neo-conservative and, in religion, always a neo-orthodox, even while I was a neo-Trotskyist and a neo-Marxist. I’m going to end up a neo. Just neo, that’s all. Neo-dash-nothing.” Irving William Kristol was born on Jan. 20, 1920, in Brooklyn into a family of low-income, nonobservant Jews. His father, Joseph, a middleman in the men’s clothing business, went bankrupt several times; his mother, Bessie, died of cancer when he was 16. “We were poor, but then everyone was poor, more or less,” Mr. Kristol recalled. In the late 1930s he attended City College, the highly politicized, overwhelmingly Jewish New York institution where his indignation at the injustices of the Great Depression pushed him to the left, but not the far left. In the large, dingy school cafeteria were a number of alcoves where students could gather with like-minded colleagues. There was an athlete’s alcove, a Catholic alcove, a black alcove, an ROTC alcove. But the alcoves that later became famous were Numbers One and Two. Alcove One held leftists of various stripes; Alcove Two housed the Stalinists, including a young Julius Rosenberg. The Stalinists outnumbered the anti-Stalinists by as much as 10-1, but among the anti-Stalinists were Mr. Bell as well as the future sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset and the future literary critic Irving Howe. Mr. Howe recruited Mr. Kristol into the Trotskyists, and though Mr. Kristol’s career as a follower of the apostate Communist Leon Trotsky was brief, it lasted beyond his graduation from City College, long enough for him to meet Ms. Himmelfarb at a Trotskyist gathering in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. He fell in love, and the two were married in 1942, when she was 19 and he was just short of his 22nd birthday. Besides William, they also had a daughter, Elizabeth. They, along with their mother and five grandchildren, survive him. After marrying, Mr. Kristol followed his wife to Chicago, where she was doing graduate work and where he had what he called “my first real experience of America.” Drafted into the Army with a number of Midwesterners who were street-tough and often anti-Semitic, he found himself shedding his youthful radical optimism. “I can’t build socialism with these people,” he concluded. “They’ll probably take it over and make a racket out of it.” In his opinion, his fellow GI’s were inclined to loot, rape and murder, and only Army discipline held them in check. It was a perception about human nature that would stay with him for the rest of his life, creating a tension with his alternative view that ordinary people were to be trusted more than intellectuals to do the right thing. After the war he and Ms. Himmelfarb spent a year in Cambridge, England, while she pursued her studies. When they returned to the United States in 1947, he took an editing job with Commentary, then a liberal anti-Communist magazine. In 1952, at the height of the McCarthy era, he wrote what he called the most controversial article of his career: “ ‘Civil Liberties,’ 1952 — A Study in Confusion.” It criticized many of those defending civil liberties against the government inquisitors, saying they failed to understand the conspiratorial danger of Communism. Though he called Senator McCarthy a “vulgar demagogue,” the article was remembered for a few lines: “For there is one thing that the American people know about Senator McCarthy: he, like them, is unequivocably anti-Communist. About the spokesmen for American liberalism, they feel they know no such thing. And with some justification.” After leaving Commentary, Mr. Kristol spent 10 months as executive director of the anti-Communist organization the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, and in 1953 he removed to England to help found Encounter magazine with the poet Stephen Spender. They made an unlikely pair: Mr. Spender, tall, artsy, sophisticated; Mr. Kristol, short, brash, still rough around the edges. Together, they made Encounter one of the foremost highbrow magazines of its time. But another explosive controversy awaited Mr. Kristol. It was later revealed that the magazine had been receiving financial support from the C.I.A. Mr. Kristol always denied any knowledge of the connection. But he hardly appeased his critics when he added that he did not disapprove of the C.I.A.’s secret subsidies. Back in New York at the end of 1958, Mr. Kristol worked for a year at another liberal anti-Communist magazine, The Reporter, then took a job at Basic Books, rising to executive vice president. In 1969 he left for New York University, and while teaching there he became a columnist for The Wall Street Journal. It was during this time that Mr. Kristol became uncomfortable with liberalism, his own and others’. He supported Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in his 1968 presidential campaign against Richard M. Nixon, saying that “the prospect of electing Mr. Nixon depresses me.” But by 1970 he was dining at the Nixon White House, and in 1972 he came out in favor of Nixon’s re-election. By the mid-’70s he had registered as a Republican. Always the neoconservative, however — aware of his liberal, even radical, roots and his distance from traditional Republicanism — he was delighted when another Democratic convert, President Ronald Reagan, expressed admiration for Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1987 he left New York University to become the John M. Olin Distinguished Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. By now Mr. Kristol was battling on several fronts. He published columns and essays attacking liberalism and the counterculture from his perches at The Wall Street Journal and The Public Interest, and in 1978 he and William E. Simon, President Nixon’s secretary of the treasury, formed the Institute for Educational Affairs to funnel corporate and foundation money to conservative causes. In 1985 he started The National Interest, a journal devoted to foreign affairs. But Mr. Kristol wasn’t railing just against the left. He criticized America’s commercial class for upholding greed and selfishness as positive values. He saw “moral anarchy” within the business community, and he urged it to take responsibility for itself and the larger society. He encouraged businessmen to give money to political candidates and help get conservative ideas across to the public. Republicans, he said, had for half a century been “the stupid party,” with not much more on their minds than balanced budgets and opposition to the welfare state. He instructed them to support economic growth by cutting taxes and not to oppose New Deal institutions. Above all, Mr. Kristol preached a faith in ordinary people. . “It is the self-imposed assignment of neoconservatives,” he wrote, “to explain to the American people why they are right, and to the intellectuals why they are wrong.” Mr. Kristol saw religion and a belief in the afterlife as the foundation for the middle-class values he championed. He argued that religion provided a necessary constraint to antisocial, anarchical impulses. Without it, he said, “the world falls apart.” Yet Mr. Kristol’s own religious views were so ambiguous that some friends questioned whether he believed in God. In 1996, he told an interviewer: “I’ve always been a believer.” But, he added, “don’t ask me in what.” “That gets too complicated,” he said. “The word ‘God’ confuses everything.” In 2002, Mr. Kristol received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, often considered the nation’s highest civilian honor. It was another satisfying moment for a man who appears to have delighted in his life or, as Andrew Sullivan put it, “to have emerged from the womb content.” He once said that his career had been “one instance of good luck after another.” Some called him a cheerful conservative. He did not dispute it. He had had much, he said, “to be cheerful about.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Irving Kristol, known as the Godfather of Modern Conservatism, passed away at the age of 89.

Answer the question...eritrea is a country located in one of these continents of the world??","completion":"Eritrea is a country located in the northeastern part of Africa, more specifically in the Horn of Africa region. It shares borders with Sudan to the west, Ethiopia to the south, and Djibouti to the southeast. To the northeast and east, Eritrea has an extensive coastline along the Red Sea, which connects Eritrea to the Arabian Peninsula. The Horn of Africa, which includes Eritrea, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Somalia, is known for its unique geographical characteristics, as it extends like a horn into the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. This makes the region strategically significant for global trade and naval routes. Eritrea was colonized by Italy in the late 19th century and became a part of Italian East Africa (with Somalia and Ethiopia) until World War II. After the defeat of Italy, the country became a British protectorate and, eventually, Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia in 1952. After a long and brutal war of independence fought between 1961 and 1991, Eritrea gained its freedom from Ethiopia and officially declared independence in May 1993. In this African context, Eritrea is considered part of sub-Saharan Africa, a geographic and cultural division that includes countries situated south of the Sahara Desert. The topography of Eritrea is diverse, with a landscape featuring highlands, volcanic plateaus, deserts, and coastal lowlands. The climate of Eritrea mainly falls under two types: a cooler and wetter highland climate and a hot, arid lowland climate. Eritrea is rich in cultural diversity, with several ethnic groups, each having its unique languages and customs, including Tigre, Saho, Bilen, Rashaida, and the largest ethnic group, Tigrinya. Eritrea's economy is primarily based on agriculture and livestock, with a considerable number of its citizens depending on subsistence farming. The service and industrial sectors are gradually developing, with a focus on mining, textiles, and food processing. The country has experienced ongoing political instability due to disputes with neighbors, especially Ethiopia, with which they've had border conflicts. Despite these challenges, Eritrea's rich cultural heritage and natural beauty make it a unique and distinctive country in the vast and diverse African continent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Pick your answer from: [+] yes [+] no","completion":"Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion. The substance mentioned in Napoleon's treatment that prevented his stomach from expelling arsenic compounds is potassium tartrate. To provide a more detailed and long answer, potassium tartrate, also known as cream of tartar, is a byproduct of the winemaking process that was commonly used in the 19th century as a medicinal treatment. It was often prescribed for various ailments, including stomach issues, due to its mild laxative and diuretic properties. In the case of Napoleon Bonaparte, it is believed that he was suffering from a chronic condition known as arsenic poisoning. This occurred either because he was being deliberately poisoned by his enemies, or due to the naturally high levels of arsenic that were present in some of the products he consumed during his exile on the island of St. Helena. The symptoms of arsenic poisoning include stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin discoloration, and extreme thirst, among others. Given these symptoms, it is not surprising that Napoleon's doctors would have prescribed potassium tartrate to help alleviate his discomfort. However, it has been suggested that this substance may have inadvertently worsened his condition by preventing his stomach from expelling the toxic arsenic compounds. This is because potassium tartrate has an affinity for binding with arsenic, forming a stable compound that is resistant to gastric expulsion. The resulting accumulation of arsenic in Napoleon's body would have led to increasing toxicity and ultimately contributed to his death. Furthermore, the extreme thirst that Napoleon experienced during his final days has also been associated with arsenic poisoning, providing additional support to the theory that his treatment with potassium tartrate had a detrimental effect on his health. In conclusion, potassium tartrate, used in Napoleon's treatment, has been suggested as the substance responsible for preventing his stomach from expelling arsenic compounds, potentially exacerbating his condition and leading to his demise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham? In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force. They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands.

For Marika Holmgren, fighting breast cancer was an uphill battle -- literally. She got back on her mountain bike shortly after her diagnosis in February 2007, smack-dab in the middle of chemotherapy. \\"The treatment is so intense -- it strips everything away. You're physically and completely changed,\\" says Holmgren, 40. \\"I was trying to retain some sense of normalcy. And truthfully, I felt a little badass being on my bike during treatment. I was giving cancer the middle finger.\\" Health.com: My Breast Cancer Diary in Pictures. Tooling around on a mountain bike during chemotherapy sounds intense, maybe even unadvisable. But just the opposite is true: Holmgren was being a model patient. In the past, doctors often told cancer patients to take it easy during treatment. Although the appropriate amount of exercise varies from patient to patient, that conventional wisdom is now considered old hat. In fact, new guidelines on cancer and exercise from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) urge cancer patients to be as physically active as possible both during and after their treatment. \\"The idea that you should be staying put and resting is ultimately doing more harm than good,\\" says Kathryn Schmitz, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, in Philadelphia. Schmitz, who studies the role of physical activity in chronic diseases, presented the guidelines at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting last week. Health.com: 30-Minute Workout, No Gym Required. The last thing people overwhelmed by cancer's psychological and physical impact may want to hear is \\"exercise more.\\" During treatment, bone-crushing fatigue, nausea, and body-changing surgery -- not to mention the emotional drain of coping with worried children, friends, and life partners -- often puts exercise very last on the list of priorities. Still, experts now say that exercise may help with -- not add to -- those problems. It boosts energy, helps stave off the weight gain often associated with treatment, and provides a psychological pick-me-up at a time when a person's morale is likely to be battered. Even small amounts help. How much exercise is enough? The ACSM recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, which works out to about 20 minutes a day -- the same amount recommended to the general public. That said, the organization is realistic about how cancer and its treatment can alter mood and energy levels. Any kind of activity -- even a short walk -- is better than none, the ACSM says. Health.com: 5 Ways to Stay Healthy After Breast Cancer. \\"The risk of inactivity for cancer patients is so great that it's best to just get started with something,\\" says Schmitz. If you begin to feel worse or overtired, Schmitz recommends discussing it with your doctor. People who were sedentary before their diagnosis should start by walking for 10 minutes each day, says Schmitz, and gradually increase their time by 10 percent to 15 percent each week until they can do 30 minutes at a stretch, five times per week. There may be days when you feel nauseous, exhausted, or utterly despondent. But friends or family can help. \\"A lot of it will be up to the caregivers, because they are the ones who will know how to motivate patients facing an uphill battle,\\" says Schmitz. \\"They're the ones who can say, 'Hey, let's get dressed today,' and then, 'Hey, let's get dressed and walk around the house.'\\" It's important to pick an activity you enjoy, says Alyson Moadel, Ph.D., the director of the psychosocial oncology program at the Albert Einstein Cancer Center, in the Bronx, New York. \\"It is not a one-size-fits-all answer, since patients may be more responsive and adherent to different fitness programs,\\" she says. \\"It's important to allow patients a choice and to tailor a fitness program to each patient.\\" Fortunately the options are greater than ever before, as exercise programs for cancer patients have become increasingly popular nationwide. In 2007 the Lance Armstrong Foundation partnered with the YMCA to provide physical activities designed specifically for survivors, and more and more hospitals are creating their own programs as well. Cancer patients who aren't willing or able to travel to a facility on a regular basis can sign up for programs that can be delivered by mail, phone, or the Internet. \\"Right now we're working to develop a variety in the types of programs available,\\" says Schmitz. Health.com: The Joy Workout. Holmgren -- a longtime mountain biker -- took to the San Francisco hills with a group of women who ride with the Bay Area chapter of Team LUNA Chix, a group of amateur bikers, runners, and triathletes affiliated with the Breast Cancer Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization based in San Francisco. \\"I had no hair, no eyelashes, and no eyebrows, and yet I didn't think they would know I had cancer,\\" says Holmgren. \\"The women were so fun and inspiring, and they never babied me. They just let me do my thing at my own pace.\\" How exercise helps. Dozens of studies have demonstrated the benefits of staying active both during and after treatment. Regular exercise can help fight the weight gain that often comes with cancer treatment, including breast cancer. \\"It's about what the typical American could expect to gain over the course of a couple of years, but it's happening all at once,\\" says Schmitz. But exercise is also important for cancer patients whose treatment can cause them to lose weight. Prostate cancer, cancers of the stomach and gut, and head and neck cancers can all lead to a significant decrease in muscle mass, as well as a loss of taste and an inability to process certain foods. \\"Those patients really need to focus on resistance exercises,\\" says Schmitz. \\"That will help them increase their muscle mass and gain that functional tissue that they need.\\" Even though most patients won't be able to accomplish the same physical feats they were capable of before their diagnoses, adds Schmitz, staying active helps them achieve \\"a whole lot more than they would have been able to if they hadn't been exercising.\\" Health.com: Fit at Any Age: Your 50s Strength Workout. Exercising has more intangible benefits as well. In a 2007 study that followed advanced cancer patients who exercised while undergoing chemo, the participants were asked to keep diaries. Many of them noted the positive mental aspects of exercise. \\"It feels good to have a sense of an everyday life again,\\" wrote one participant. \\"I have become incredibly energetic,\\" wrote another. In addition to making patients feel normal again, staying active is a way for patients to measure the progress of their recovery. Holmgren stuck with her rides all summer while undergoing chemo. \\"They became a real benchmark for me,\\" she says. \\"The more I would ride, the more I felt like I was getting back to my old self.\\" Though Holmgren still can't match some of the climbs she conquered pre-diagnosis, mountain biking has helped her make peace with her changed body. \\"The hormone treatment, early menopause, early arthritis, the weight gain, the surgeries -- breast cancer takes a huge toll on your body,\\" she says. \\"I knew I was going to feel bad no matter what, so I figured I might as well be feeling bad on my bike doing something that I used to do -- and something that people not going through cancer might not be able to do.\\" Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com.

Or so has been the suggestion this week -- on the heels of Obama's aggressive endorsement of net neutrality, his big climate deal with China, and leaks suggesting he's still going to go big on immigration. The New York Times says Obama's \\"defying label of lame duck.\\" Politico observes that \\"there’s already some swagger returning to his step.\\" The Washington Post notes Obama has said he wants to \\"squeeze every last little bit of opportunity\\" to push his agenda and in recent days \\"he has shown that he meant it.\\" The New Yorker says, simply, that he's had an \\"unexpectedly good week.\\" This is a grand slam of assessment -- his brand is doing much better post-election than he says it did pre-election -- but it's way too early to suggest that he's somehow crawled out of the dark place that voters put him last week. 1. His job approval rating is still in the gutter. There haven't been many polls since last Tuesday, but Gallup's daily tracking poll shows Obama with a 41 percent approval rating, near the all-time low of 39 percent reached in the survey immediately following the mid-term election. His disapproval rating of 53 percent ranks just south of the 56 percent of Americans who disapproved of his performance in the same survey following the election. It's a bit better than what George W. Bush faced at this time, but much worse than how Americans rated Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton at the end of their sixth year. 2. His endorsement of net neutrality was no profile in courage, and he may not even get what he wants. On Monday, Obama surprised many Internet activists and telecommunications firms with an unequivocal endorsement of net neutrality. Obama said he believes telecom companies like Verizon and Comcast should be regulated by the Federal Communications Commission effectively as utilities, requiring that the firms treat all Internet traffic equally. While it generated much buzz and was unusually flashy, this wasn't quite as dramatic as Obama's endorsement of gay marriage, for example, before the 2012 presidential election. As far back as 2007, after all, Obama had said, \\"I am a strong supporter of net neutrality.\\" What makes Monday's pronouncement even less impressive is that the FCC may not embrace his view, as my colleagues Brian Fung and Nancy Scolla reported in a blockbuster story. Obama has appointed all five of the independent agency's commissioners, three of whom are Democrats, including Chairman Tom Wheeler. Yet Wheeler hasn't committed to Obama's preferred path. 3. The China deal is unlikely to be enough to avoid the worst effects of climate change and relies in big part on Obama's successor. The deal is no doubt important: It commits the U.S. to stringent goals for limiting the emission of greenhouse gases and, more importantly, represents the most significant pledge by China, one of the worst polluting nations, to take a leap forward in combating global warming. Yet, on its own, it will unlikely be adequate to stem the 2 degree Celsius rise in temperatures (over pre-industrial levels) that climate scientists warn would cause severe harm to the planet. What's more, Obama relies on his successors following through. With the enactment of limits on emissions by coal-fire power plants and other measures, the president has put the United States on a path toward meeting its commitment. But a Republican president could attempt to dismantle or interfere with the new power plant rules, or show much less interest in continuing to increase fuel efficiency standards. An array of lawsuits also likely faces the power plant rules, which the EPA is still working to implement. President Obama, speaking at a news conference in Burma on Friday, said he would take action to reform U.S. immigration policy before the end of the year. (Reuters) 4. By acting on immigration, Obama is belatedly doing what he promised to do, and it has risks. Obama is not backing away from his pre-election commitment to use executive authority to address the nation's broken immigration system in lieu of action by Congress, contemplating a proposal that might stop the deportation of up to five million illegal immigrants. In Burma on Friday, he said \\"this is something that needs to be done. It’s way overdue.\\" But, like with net neutrality, this is not a sudden, post-election assertion of power. Obama is merely, finally fulfilling a broken promise he made to the nation's immigrants back in June. When it became clear that House Republicans were not going to pass a broad overhaul of immigration law, the president promised to use his unilateral authority by summer's end. Conservative Democrats begged him to delay, worried that such an action could cost the party their hold on Congress. Obama acquiesced to the political pressure, breaking his word, but lost the Senate anyway. For failing to uphold his promise, Hispanic Americans shredded him, calling him \\"deporter in chief,\\" and warned that 60,000 to 70,000 people would be deported just as a result of the delay. The imminent executive action, meanwhile, is not cost-free. It almost certain kills any chance for comprehensive reform, not that the odds were great. And it could sour relations with lawmakers in the middle, like Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent that caucuses with Democrats, who's said that “it will create a backlash in the country that could actually set the cause back and inflame our politics in a way that I don’t think will be conducive to solving the problem.\\" 5. The American people are looking to Republicans to make a difference. Six years into Obama's presidency, Americans surveyed by Gallup say that they are looking, by a 53-to-36 percent margin, \\"to have more influence over the direction of the nation.\\" That's even more unbalanced than it was after the 2010 electoral drubbing. Meanwhile, 34 percent of Americans say the country will be better off as a result of Republicans' win, compared to 19 percent who believe we'll be worse off. Obama faces deep and broad skepticism among the American public, and that gives him a weak hand going into legislative battles to come. 6. Obama faces many obstacles and little time. Republicans have a healthy majority in the Senate and the largest majority in the House since 1949. After brutal disagreements about 2014 strategy, there's little love lost between the White House and Senate Democrats. As a result, Obama faces probably the most antagonistic Congress he's faced since coming to office. Not a great place to be during your final two years. First up, the Senate is set to approve the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline on Tuesday after the House passed a measure authorization the project Friday. Obama has assiduously tried to avoid allowing the project to move forward, given concerns of many of his advisers that it would be harmful, symbolically if not substantively, to efforts to stem global warming. If Obama vetoes Keystone, as expected, he could worsen the already-bad odds of Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.), who's pushing for construction of the pipeline, in next month's run-off. If he signs the legislation, he would have had his hand forced on a high-profile policy just two weeks after the mid-terms. Next spring, Obama could suffer another bad defeat if the Supreme Court rules unfavorably in the King v. Burwell case, which challenges the constitutionality of tax subsidies offered to low- and moderate-income American in states that did not create their own insurance marketplaces. Declaring those subsidies unconstitutional would undermine a key part of the law and cost millions of people health insurance. And finally, the president has little time. There have been few achievements in the final quarter of a presidency, but many problems: For Bush, it was a financial crisis. For Clinton, it was impeachment and the dotcom bubble bursting. For Reagan, it was Iran-Contra. Richard Nixon resigned and Lyndon Johnson was consumed by the Vietnam War. That's why some close observers say there is a \\"second term curse.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is talking about President Obama and how, even though he has been making announcements and trying new things recently, he still has a lot of challenges ahead.

The building, known as the Tower of David — or \\"Torre de David\\" — has loomed over the city for two decades since construction was abandoned in 1994. Locals viewed the crumbling tower, the country's third-tallest, as both a gritty refuge for local gangs and commune-like village, where squatters partitioned raw spaces into well-kept apartments and pitched in to provide makeshift services. Each floor had its own manager, and there were cafes, shops and even a basketball court. The tower was even featured on the hit Showtime series \\"Homeland.\\" In a third-season episode, Damian Lewis' ex-POW character, Nicholas Brody, is held there by gangsters while on the run from the CIA. But Venezuelan officials deemed the high-rise unsafe — there were no elevators and residents had tumbled off ledges — and began what they described as a \\"peaceful,\\" floor-by-floor eviction of mobs of squatters this week. Residents were being relocated to public housing in the town of Cua, south of Caracas. Many said they were sad to go. \\"Necessity brought me here, and the tower gave me a good home,\\" Yuraima Parra, 27, told Reuters, as soldiers loaded her possessions into a truck. \\"I was here for seven years. I'm going to miss it, but it's time to move on.\\" Construction on the three-building complex began in 1990. It was intended as an office center. But work halted after the project's chief financier, David Brillembourg, died in 1993. President Nicolas Maduro's government has not yet said what it will do with the complex once it is empty. There were rumors that Chinese developers were gunning to buy it and convert it into commercial space. Ernesto Villegas, minister for the transformation of Caracas, wouldn't speculate on the site's future, saying that the focus was currently moving more than 1,150 families into safer digs. \\"The tower does not meet the minimum conditions for safe, dignified living,\\" Villegas told reporters at the site. Robinson Alarcon, 34, spent five years living on the ninth-floor. He packed up his belongings and moved out with his wife and three children on Tuesday. \\"The view was so beautiful,\\" Alarcon told Reuters. \\"People are excited but sad too.\\" Summary:","completion":"There is a very tall building in Venezuela called the Tower of David.

This issue is closely linked with the issue of climate change, as many of the anticipated health risks of climate change are associated with changes in biodiversity (e.g. changes in populations and distribution of disease vectors, scarcity of fresh water, impacts on agricultural biodiversity and food resources etc.) This is because the species most likely to disappear are those that buffer against infectious disease transmission, while surviving species tend to be the ones that increase disease transmission, such as that of West Nile Virus, Lyme disease and Hantavirus, according to a study done co-authored by Felicia Keesing, an ecologist at Bard College, and Drew Harvell, associate director for Environment of the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future (ACSF) at Cornell University.

Article: Do you think hard work can make anything possible? If you don't, you may want to read the book We Can Do written by Moshe Kai Cavalin. It might change your mind. Moshe Kai Cavalin is a 14-year-old American boy. He is about to graduate from UCLA (University of California at Los Angeles) this year. Before that, he had already gotten a degree from East Los Angeles Community College in 2009. Recently, Cavalin published the book We Can Do. In this book, he talks about how to achieve things we want, by keeping yourself focused and trying your best to do everything. He says this doesn't need genius , just hard work. Cavalin says being called a genius \\"has always bothered me... People need to know they don't have to be geniuses; they just need to work hard and they can achieve anything. If I can reach the stars, others can reach the Milky Way(,).\\" The idea of writing a book came from a teacher named Richard Avila at his first college. Cavalin says Avila inspired him to write a book to explain how he succeeded, so he could inspire other people. It took Cavalin four years to finish the book. Because his mother is Chinese, she wanted to publish the book in Chinese. So Cavalin translated the book into Chinese by himself. The book did well in Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.

Tolkien la realización de una versión en dibujos animados de El Señor de los Anillos. Si bien el autor dio su visto bueno a algunos de los bocetos elaborados para la película, el guion elaborado por Morton Grady Zimmerman incluía numerosas modificaciones en la historia, lo que provocó su indignación y finalmente la cancelación del proyecto. Entre los cambios realizados estaba la eliminación de la escena en la que Galadriel se siente tentada por el Anillo Único, calificada como «significativa» por J. R. R.

Question: Who does Dillon claims is his girlfriend? Movie title: School Ties Movie plot: David Greene (Brendan Fraser) is a working-class Jewish teenager from Scranton, Pennsylvania, during the 1950s who is given a football scholarship to St. Matthew's, an exclusive Massachusetts prep school, for his senior year. Upon his arrival, he meets his teammates Rip Van Kelt (Randall Batinkoff), Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon), Jack Connors (Cole Hauser), and his roommate Chris Reece (Chris O'Donnell) and learns of the school's cherished honor code system. Soon learning that his new friends are prejudiced against Jews, he suppresses his background. David becomes the team hero and wins the attentions of beautiful dÃ©butante Sally Wheeler (Amy Locane), whom Dillon claims is his girlfriend. In the afterglow of a victory over the school's chief rival St. Luke's, Dillon inadvertently discovers that David is Jewish and, out of jealousy, makes this widely known, causing Sally and his teammates to turn against Davidâsoon after, he finds a sign above his bed bearing a swastika and the words \\"Go home Jew\\". David is constantly harassed by his classmates, led by Richard \\"McGoo\\" Collins (Anthony Rapp) and his body guard-like roommate Chesty Smith (Ben Affleck); only Reece and another unnamed student remain loyal to Greene. Overwhelmed by pressure from his prestigious family, Dillon uses a crib sheet to cheat in an important history exam. David and Van Kelt each spot him doing so, but remain silent. Dillon gets pushed while leaving class and drops the sheet on the floor after the test; when the teacher, Mr. Geirasch (Michael Higgins), discovers it, he informs the class that he will fail all of them if the cheater does not confess. He leaves the task of finding the cheater up to the students, led by Van Kelt, the head prefect. When David confronts Dillon and threatens to turn him in if he does not confess, Dillon unsuccessfully attempts to buy David's silence with money.

Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby (first name generally given as Irv, Irve or Irving; born August 22, 1950) is an American lawyer and former advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney. From 2001 to 2005, Libby held the offices of Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States and Assistant to the President during the administration of President George W. Bush. In October 2005, Libby resigned from all three government positions after he was indicted on five counts by a federal grand jury concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-Contra affair. Libby was born to an affluent Jewish family in New Haven, Connecticut; his late father, Irving Lewis Liebowitz, was an investment banker. Libby graduated from the Eaglebrook School, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, a middle school, in 1965. The family lived in the Washington region, Miami and Connecticut prior to Libby's graduation from Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1968. He and his elder brother, Hank, a retired tax lawyer, were the first in the family to graduate from college. Libby matriculated at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in Fall 1968, graduating magna cum laude in 1972. As Yale Daily News reporter Jack Mirkinson observes, \\"Even though he would eventually become a prominent Republican, Libby's political beginnings would not have pointed in that direction. He served as vice president of the Yale College Democrats and later campaigned for Michael Dukakis when he was running for governor of Massachusetts.\\" According to Mirkinson: \\"Two particular Yale courses helped guide Libby's future endeavors. One of these was a creative writing course, which started Libby on a 20-year mission to complete a novel ... [later published as] The Apprentice ... [and] a political science class with professor and future Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. In an interview with author James Mann, Libby said Wolfowitz was one of his favorite professors, and their professional relationship did not end with the class.\\" Wolfowitz became a significant mentor in his later professional life.

Matilde Conejero, 47, used a child’s scooter to break the front and rear windscreens of the TV star’s top-of-the-range 4x4 vehicle, causing £12,000 of damage.

Matilde Conejero and Marco Pierre White arriving separately at court today: The estranged wife today admitted to damaging the chef's Range Rover. Eventually, when a woman appeared at the door, Conejero ‘lurched’ at her in a jealous rage and had to be restrained by police. Nicholas Alexander, prosecuting, told. Isleworth Crown Court how Pierre White, 50, was asleep at his luxury. home in Holland Park on May 7 when he was woken by a commotion outside. Mr Alexander said: ‘He could hear noise coming from outside the property and went to the window to see what it was. ‘Whilst looking through the window he. could see his wife by his Range Rover, smashing the vehicle and damaging. it using a child’s scooter. Extensive damage was caused to the. vehicle.’ The court heard police were called and an officer arrived to find both windscreens had been damaged and the panels scratched.

Article: Gavin Joseph, a teenager with Asperger's Syndrome, was beaten up by a group of people for just being different. Asperger's Syndrome is a developmental disorder that affects a person's ability to socialize. But instead of putting them into prison for what they did to him, Gavin offered them a chance to become more tolerant and understanding. On Thursday night, some kids were talking about how \\"it's weird \\" that he is always by himself, attending events alone and watching people, and it was \\"creepy\\" that he wanted to be friends with people he didn't know. On Friday night, another kid that overheard that conversation decided to take matters into his own hands and become judge and jury, and this is the result of that. He didn't ask questions, didn't get to know Gavin, never met him, and didn't give him a chance to leave. Gavin was called to meet someone, surrounded by people he didn't know, choked, punched , and left lying on the pavement so he would \\"learn his lesson\\". Gavin emerged from the attack with a concussion , a fractured nose, a bruised esophagus and some damage to his eyes, but thankfully, none of the injuries resulted in permanent damage. But here's the truly amazing part -- Gavin refused to press charges against the people who did this to him. Instead of wanting to see them punished, he wants to see them educated. Gavin asked that his attackers do community service that is disability-related. According to his mother, Gavin also asked that they watch a 20-minute video statement he taped while their families were present so they could see the damage they did and hear the event from his perspective. \\"If you are reading this, I hope you talk to your teens,\\" his mother wrote. \\"Tell them about disabilities you can't see, teach them to be tolerant of people that are different, teach them that if they continuously see someone alone that maybe it is not their choice to be alone, remind them to ask questions first and get to know one another.\\" Question: How did Gavin react to his injuries? - He fought back bravely. - He was too scared to react. - He decided to turn to court for help. - He wanted to see the attackers educated.

Movie title: Black August Movie plot: Feature Description:The George Jackson story has now been developed into a movie entitled Black August. It depicts the last 14 months of George Jackson's existence under the subjective and objective conditions of captivity. Sentenced to one year-to-life at age 18, for a 70 gas station robbery in 1960, George Jackson would spend the next 11 years in California's industrial prison complex, 7 years of which were in solitary confinement. The movie encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The movie also reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities in America as well as their influence on prisoners across the country. George Jackson would be moved and inspired as a result of the Panther Party activities. As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, would be killed at the Marin County Courthouse, at San Raphael, California, during an alleged hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other Soledad Brothers. The younger Jackson and thre others would be killed, including Superior Judge, Harold Haley. and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at San Quentin State Prison, California, during what is discribed as a prison break attempt.

Allegations date back to her time as French finance minister. She says decision to investigate her was 'totally without merit' Faces questions over role in £318m payment to businessman Bernard Tapie.","completion":"Title: Christine Lagarde Faces Charges of 'Negligence' in Corruption Probe Introduction: Christine Lagarde, former French finance minister and current managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has been charged with 'negligence’ in a corruption probe that dates back to her time in the French government. Insisting that the decision to investigate her was 'totally without merit,' Lagarde is now facing scrutiny over her role in a £318 million payment to businessman Bernard Tapie during her tenure as finance minister. Background on Christine Lagarde: Christine Lagarde is a renowned French lawyer and politician who has served in various high-profile positions in her career. With a diverse background in law, management, and global economics, she became the first woman to head the International Monetary Fund (IMF) when she replaced Dominique Strauss-Kahn in 2011. Despite her extensive experience, Lagarde has found herself embroiled in allegations of negligence, which have called her integrity into question. The Corruption Probe: The corruption probe stems from Lagarde's time as French finance minister under former President Nicolas Sarkozy between 2007 and 2011. In question is her involvement in a controversial £318 million payment to Bernard Tapie, a French businessman and former politician. Tapie had previously sued the state-owned bank, Crédit Lyonnais, for a botched handling of the sale of his stake in sports company Adidas in the 1990s, claiming that the bank had defrauded him. During her time as finance minister, Lagarde allegedly overruled experts and decided to submit the dispute to an arbitration process, which later awarded Tapie substantial damages to resolve the issue. However, critics argue that this repayment was unnecessary and may have been the result of a behind-the-scenes deal between Tapie and the French government. This has led to an ongoing investigation into whether Lagarde's decision to approve the payment was driven by political favoritism or worse – corruption. Lagarde’s Defense: In response to the charges of negligence, Lagarde has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. She has also expressed her frustration with the ongoing investigation, declaring the decision to probe her role in the Tapie affair as 'totally without merit.' Lagarde has also garnered support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), where she currently serves as the managing director. The IMF executive board has expressed its confidence in her leadership and her ability to carry out her duties effectively while the investigation continues. Potential Consequences: The charges, however, are serious, and if found guilty, Christine Lagarde could face up to one-year imprisonment and €15,000 in fines. Additionally, this would damage her reputation and standing as IMF director, which may lead to her resignation or removal from the post, depending on the outcome of the investigation. Lagarde's conviction could also threaten the credibility of the International Monetary Fund, given her prominent role in the organization. Conclusion: As a distinguished and influential figure in the world of global finance, Christine Lagarde is now faced with a test of her integrity and public image. The ongoing corruption probe into her decision-making during her time as French finance minister raises questions over political favoritism and her ability to serve as an impartial leader of a major international institution like the IMF. As more information on the investigation becomes public, Lagarde's position and future in the world of finance remain uncertain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Roots have primary and secondary meristems for growth in length and width, and most plants have roots . Given these facts, what have meristems for growth among the following options: - plants - humans - tortoises - animals - Conifers - Flowers - moss - cacti Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, meristems for growth can be found in plants, conifers, flowers, moss, and cacti. I will explain the presence of meristems in each of these categories and their role in growth. 1. Plants: Meristems are a feature of almost all plants. They are regions of undifferentiated cells that have the potential to divide and produce different specialized cell types. In plants, the primary meristems (apical meristems) are responsible for growth in length, which occurs at the tips of roots and shoots. Secondary meristems (lateral meristems) contribute to growth in width and are located in the vascular cambium and cork cambium, which help form the bark and wood. 2. Conifers: Conifers are a type of gymnosperm, which are seed-producing plants. They also possess meristems for growth. The apical meristems found at the tips of roots and shoots allow for the elongation of plant organs. The activity of lateral meristems (vascular cambium and cork cambium) facilitates the increase in girth of the trunk or stem. 3. Flowers: Flowers, as reproductive structures of angiosperms (flowering plants), exhibit meristematic activity. The growth and development of floral organs, such as sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels, rely on the division of undifferentiated cells in the meristem. Specifically, the floral meristem located at the shoot apex undergoes cellular differentiation and organogenesis to form different floral parts. 4. Moss: Mosses belong to the group of non-vascular plants called bryophytes. They possess apical meristems and lack vascular tissue which allows them to grow horizontally along surfaces. Apical meristems are present at the tips of protonema (the filamentous structure that ultimately differentiates into the highly branched gametophore) and gametophores (the leafy structure that develops from the protonema). 5. Cacti: Cacti are flowering plants and also have meristems for growth. They are adapted to arid conditions and have specialized structures called areoles, which are condensed axillary meristems. Areoles give rise to different structures, such as spines (modified leaves), flowers, and new branches (cladodes). Apical meristems are responsible for elongation growth in cacti, while the activity of vascular and cork cambium contributes to increased girth. In contrast, humans, tortoises, and animals, being members of the animal kingdom, do not possess meristems.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

And I was wondering What will Cameron want to do next? Pick your answer from: A). appear at Cameron's parole hearing. B). put a hit on Cameron. C). repent. Answer:","completion":"It is difficult to predict exactly what Cameron will want to do next, as the future actions of an individual largely depend on their character, experiences, and circumstances. However, given the provided options: A). Appear at Cameron's parole hearing: It is possible that Cameron might want to appear at his parole hearing to seek a reduced sentence or express remorse for his actions. This would be an opportunity for Cameron to demonstrate his personal growth and the reasons why he believes he deserves a chance at parole. B). Put a hit on Cameron: This option seems less likely, as it would imply that Cameron would want to harm himself, which is usually not a typical course of action. However, desperate situations may push people to extreme measures, so without additional context, it cannot be completely ruled out. C). Repent: After committing such a heinous act, many individuals may feel guilt and remorse and wish to seek forgiveness and make amends. Therefore, it's possible that Cameron would choose to repent for his actions, either through religious means, therapy, or by working to help others. Ultimately, the choice Cameron makes will be influenced by a range of factors, such as his feelings of guilt and remorse, his long-term outlook on life, and his desire for redemption.

The conversation soon turned to complaining about the stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and many cups-china , plastic and glass, some plain looking, some expensive and some lovely. The professor told them to help themselves to the coffee. When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said, \\"Can you notice all the nice looking expensive cups were taken, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones? While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress.\\" \\"What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you went for the best cups and were eyeing each other's cups.\\" \\"Now think about this: life is the coffee, and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups.

Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: When did F15s first fly Suggested answer: The F-15 was originally envisioned as a pure air superiority aircraft. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"While the suggested answer provides some information regarding the original purpose of the F-15 aircraft, it does not directly answer the specific question about when the F-15s first flew. To accurately validate the generated answer, more relevant information is needed. The F-15 Eagle, developed by McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing), is an American twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft designed to gain and maintain air superiority in aerial combat. The development of the F-15 began in the late 1960s with the goal of creating an aircraft that would be unmatched in air-to-air combat. The first flight of the F-15 occurred on July 27, 1972, with test pilot Irving L. Burrows at the controls. After extensive testing and evaluation, the first production F-15A rolled out in November 1974, and the first operational F-15 Eagle was delivered to the United States Air Force (USAF) in November 1974. The aircraft was declared fully operational in September 1975. Despite its initial design as a dedicated air superiority aircraft, the F-15 has evolved over the years, with several variants being developed for various roles, such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, which is used for air-to-ground missions, in addition to its air-to-air capabilities. In summary, the F-15 first flew on July 27, 1972, while the statement provided that it was envisioned as a pure air superiority aircraft offers context, it doesn't answer the question directly. A more appropriate answer would be: \\"The F-15s first flew on July 27, 1972.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Small chores each night, like tidying up your room, can reduce longer cleaning sessions during the weekend. Cleaning also helps to reduce clutter that can be distracting when you’re trying to do your homework or relax. Make sure you have enough time in the afternoon or at night to complete your homework so you don't feel rushed trying to get it done. The amount of time you set aside for homework each day depends on how much homework you have. Exercise is important in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. It also positively influences your mental health by releasing endorphins that improve your self-confidence and mood. Depending on what works best for your schedule, you can exercise in the morning or right after school. Working out can increase your energy level so try to finish your exercise routine at least three hours before bedtime so you have enough time to relax before bed. Exercise can be a good way for you to make time for yourself, but if you had P.E. or sports practice during the day, find another way to help you relax like reading a book, journaling, or socializing with friends and family. A good choice for a typical school day is a nice skirt or a pair of jeans, and a top that you know you will be comfy in and that you can dress up with jewelry and accessories. Look at the weather forecast for the next day and pick your outfit accordingly. If it's going to be cold the next day, make sure to have warm clothing like a coat or scarf set aside. Put the books and the homework you'll need for the next day in your bag. If you have extracurricular activities the next day, make sure what you need is ready to go for the next morning. If you have band practice, make sure you have your instrument packed up and ready for school. If you have sports practice, make sure your athletic equipment is also packed up. Doing these things the night before will save you time in the morning. Look at your agenda or planner to see what you'll need to pack in terms of a sweater, an umbrella, homework, and permission slips. Keeping a good sleep schedule has positive effects on your health and can make you feel better. Don’t drink caffeine and make your room as dark as possible. Minimize blue light from electronic screens like your cellphone or computer screen. Summary:","completion":"Doing little chores each night, like cleaning your room, helps make it easier to relax and focus on homework. Set aside time to finish your homework and exercise to stay healthy and happy.

Paragraph: On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits.

I grew up in Las Vegas but recently moved to San Diego. We were coming back for Christmas so we thought this would be the perfect time to try out this hotel. I booked the hotel well over a month in advance. We got a really good deal because we stayed 3 nights and had a AAA discount. We get to the hotel, getting into the driveway was a little confusing because the enter lane was blocked off but it didn't take long for us to find the entrance. We pull up, the hotel is valet only. That would've been nice to know. We go in to check in, no outside food or beverage. So, we couldn't have a pre-drink in our room and I was worried about the food I had brought from San Diego for Christmas. That was really annoying. I understand they want us to eat/drink at their restaurant, but we were going to anyway. The lobby/bar was very beautiful though and it smelt very nice. One of the valet drivers helps us with our luggage to the room, no elevators so we helped him take our bags off the cart and up to the room. We walk right into the doors that go into our building and our room was right there. Seemed convenient but we later found out it was horrible. That door was so loud that every time someone walked in or out of the building, we heard it all! There was not an iron or ironing board in the room, but they did have one available, but when you went to iron your clothes, water poured out. There was not a coffee maker in the room....ok no big deal. The bathroom was beautiful and the room itself was decorated nicely, the bed was comfortable. There was a patio but I had no desire to go out there since we were right at a brick wall. The pool are was really neat looking. It had great furniture. I tried to call for room service one night because my husband was fast asleep and it was 11:30 at night. The kitchen closes at 11:30. Ok that's fine but I couldn't bring up the food from the car because no outside food or beverages. And the phone didn't work. The handset must've had a dead battery because the speaker phone worked. And back to the valet only, since we didn't know, we didn't have cash on us to tip them with, so my husband told the valet driver that he was sorry but we didn't know it was valet only, we don't have a tip but we will get him when we come back and he just jumped out of the car and walked away! We did end up bringing cash back when we returned but he wasn't there. So yes, the room is beautiful, but the overall stay was a nightmare. I will not stay here again and I will not encourage my friends to stay there either. I've had a better stay at other cheaper hotels. Choose the sentiment of this review?

The team enters and slowly uncovers the truth about the secret research that took place in Scoop 7 years ago. Act 2: As they explore, they come across two medically preserved humans named Luke and Sara, who were part of the human augmentation program but forgotten as the project was dismantled. After a careful retrieval process, Luke and Sara are awakened and find themselves confused and disoriented, unable to recall the details of their past clearly. They discover their superhuman abilities while adjusting to the world that has changed drastically since they last remember it. This discovery attracts various powers' attention - both good and evil. The government immediately takes both into custody to study their abilities further and better understand the past. Act 3: During a series of tests, Luke and Sara begin to regain fragments of their memory, including flashes of their previous lives and the horrors that led to their current state. They decide to escape the facility and set a course to uncover the truth. Along the way, they prevent a terrorist attack using their newfound abilities, but this act only furthers the interest in them by both the government and other nefarious groups. Act 4: As they delve deeper into their past, they discover that the project at Scoop 7 was shut down due to ethical concerns and the possibility of leaking dangerous human experiments. Luke and Sara confront the people responsible for their suffering and must decide what path to take - revenge or redemption. Act 5: In a final act of self-discovery, Luke and Sara choose to expose the truth to the world by releasing the data they collected on Scoop 7.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I was the youngest of five boys and also had four sisters who had to pull together and take care of each other. Dad wasn't around, so I never knew him well. He killed himself when I was three years old, leaving mom with the job of raising nine kids. She was a very hard worker, and in order to make ends meet, she hardly ever rested. With my mom as my example, I learned that hard work is the best way to get what you want. Even as a little boy, I knew I was going to be successful. Regardless of what I chose, I wanted to make my brothers, sisters and mom proud of me--not only by being successful in what I chose to do, but also as a person who could be looked up to for the right reasons. Surprising as it might seem, basketball wasn't in my plans. One day, my mom cut a rim off an old water barrel and then held it up for me to throw an old rubber ball through. By junior high, I started playing basketball on a team. I loved to compete. For me, it paid off. I always put the effort in, every day. I am grateful for the life I've enjoyed as a basketball star. Basketball is not life. It can be exciting. But the most important thing about basketball is that it gives me a way to do good things for others as I move through this journey called life.

The phrase, \\"two heads are wiser than one\\" never appears in the text, nor is it implicitly suggested. So, option D is also not correct.

Question: Information: - The Haplogynae are a clade of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. - The Prodidomidae are a spider family with about 300 species in 31 genera. They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders. - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia. - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers. - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea). - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs). - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently . - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica. - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade. - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders. - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species. - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic. After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'dionycha' with the relationship of 'instance of'.

Additionally, the US Congress is acknowledging and paying tribute to those affected by other recent incidents of terrorism in Russia. The situation referred to in the text occurred in September 2004, when a group of armed terrorists, connected to separatist movements in Chechnya and Ingushetia, seized control of a school located in Beslan, North Ossetia, a republic in the southern region of Russia. The attackers took more than 1,000 people hostage, including children, teachers, and parents who were gathered at the school for a ceremony celebrating the beginning of the academic year. The hostage crisis lasted for three tense days, during which the terrorists demanded recognition of Chechen independence and the withdrawal of Russian forces from the region, among other conditions. On the third day of the siege, Russian forces, in a controversial decision, stormed the school in a chaotic rescue attempt. As a result, explosions and exchanges of gunfire took place between the militants and security forces, leading to the collapse of the school gymnasium's roof and widespread destruction. In the end, more than 330 people lost their lives, of which 186 were children. Many others were injured during the incident, and the Beslan school siege became a symbol of Russia's struggle against terrorism and extremism in the region. The US Congress, in an act of international solidarity and empathy, paid tribute to the hundreds of innocent lives lost in the terrorist takeover of the school in Beslan, as well as honoring the victims of other recent terrorist acts in Russia. This gesture highlights the importance of standing together against acts of terrorism and violence, sharing in the global responsibility to support one another in times of crisis, and recognizing the need for unified efforts to confront the challenges posed by terrorism and extremism worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation. I cleaned up, went to bed, and went back to London a few weeks later. But I cat proofed the house first. (Yes, they still lived with me for another 12 years before passing away.)

How do you do this: How can I cool a batch of Halloween cookies I just made?","completion":"To cool a batch of freshly baked Halloween cookies, follow these detailed steps to ensure that your treats maintain their shape, texture, and taste before you start decorating or storing them. 1. Remove the cookies from the oven: After baking the cookies as per your recipe, carefully take the tray out of the oven using oven mitts or a thick towel to protect your hands. Remember to turn off the oven after removing the cookies. 2. Allow the cookies to set: Let the cookies sit on the baking tray for at least two to three minutes. This step is crucial because the residual heat from the tray helps the cookies finish baking and firm up, making it easier for you to transfer them without breaking or deforming their Halloween shapes. 3. Prepare a cooling area: While the cookies set on the baking tray, designate a designated cooling area on your kitchen countertop with enough space to accommodate all your cookies. Make sure the area is clean and free from direct sunlight or any heat sources. 4. Set up a cooling rack: To cool your cookies efficiently, use a wire cooling rack which promotes air circulation and prevents your cookies from becoming soggy. If you don't have a cooling rack, you can also use a cutting board, a large plate or a clean, dry baking sheet lined with parchment paper as an alternative. 5. Transfer the cookies: Once the cookies have set, use a thin spatula to carefully lift them off the baking tray and place them onto the cooling rack, leaving some space between each cookie. If your cookies are tender or have delicate structures, provide additional support with the help of another utensil. 6. Let the cookies cool completely: Allow the cookies to cool for at least 20-30 minutes on the rack, or until they reach room temperature. Cooling time may vary depending on the size and thickness of your cookies. During this time, the cookies will firm up, making them sturdier and easier to handle. 7. Check for doneness: After the cookies have cooled, gently lift one to ensure that it has cooled completely and is not sticking to the rack or the surface underneath. If you detect any residual heat or moisture, give the cookies more time to cool. 8. Store or decorate: Once the cookies have cooled completely, you can either decorate them using icing, frosting, or other edible Halloween embellishments or store them in an airtight container with layers of parchment paper separating them to prevent sticking. It is essential to cool the cookies thoroughly before decorating or storing them, as excessive heat or moisture can affect the taste and texture. By following these detailed steps, you will be able to effectively cool a batch of Halloween cookies, ensuring that they remain delicious, intact, and ready for decoration or storage. Patience is key when cooling baked goods, so take the time to let your cookies rest before moving on to the next step."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!). What is probably true about airmiles? A. Airmiles are rewarding B. not enough information C. Airmiles are costly D. Airmiles are inexpensive Answer:","completion":"C. Airmiles are costly In your analysis of your year of travel, you mention that by traveling less and increasing the number of clients who work with you online, you have managed to avoid as much as 20,000 miles of travel. This, in turn, has led to significant savings for your clients who no longer have to pay for the airmiles that are wrapped up in your regular fee structure. This clearly indicates that airmiles can be costly, both in terms of expense and their impact on the environment. Additionally, you mention the improved quality of your work due to this shift to online work and coaching, as opposed to day-long workshops. This further reinforces the notion that cutting down on airmiles can contribute to improved results, particularly in the fields of education and consulting. Encouraging more school leaders, teachers, and corporate clients to engage in coaching and online interactions, and understanding the value of taking regular 'me time,' has proven to have a significant positive impact on the quantity, quality, and breadth of work your team is doing. In summary, your analysis points towards the conclusion that airmiles are costly, not only in terms of financial expenses but also in terms of environmental impact and the potential to limit the effectiveness of the work being done. By embracing a model that reduces airmiles, you and your team have been able to enjoy a more successful year and provide a more valuable experience for your clients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After putting this application to the test in my day-to-day routine, I have decided to give it a 4-star rating. While the app has many solid aspects and adds a unique touch to my Android experience, I did encounter a few areas that could use improvement. Let me begin with the positive features that make this app stand out. First and foremost, the User Interface (UI) is clean, sleek, and modern, which greatly enhances the overall experience for its users. It is reasonably intuitive, allowing users to quickly navigate through the various settings and customize their preferences. Many widgets and themes available in the app allow for a fair amount of personalization and definitely add a touch of uniqueness to the device's lock screen. Another key aspect of the app is its battery-friendly nature. I have used similar apps in the past, and unfortunately, the increased functionality tends to take a toll on battery life. However, com.achep.acdisplay has clearly been optimized in this regard, as I have noticed minimal impact on my battery duration. As a notification manager, the app effectively displays various notifications on the lock screen in a visually appealing manner. I particularly enjoy the capability to preview notifications directly on the lock screen and interact with them accordingly. Additionally, the app makes it possible to customize the level of detail shown in push notifications. That being said, there are a few aspects holding this application back from being a perfect 5-star app. Occasionally, I have encountered bugs that cause the app to crash or freeze. Although not a frequent occurrence, the disruption to my notification management experience has been somewhat unpleasant. Additionally, while the app is very good at providing customization options for handling notifications, I found the initial setup to be rather time-consuming. A guided setup process or a more streamlined initial configuration would significantly improve the user onboarding process. The app could also benefit from clearer instructions and more detailed explanations of each feature for first-time users. While I was eventually able to figure out all the settings on my own, a more comprehensive user manual or in-app help section would definitely be an asset to those who may be less tech-savvy or well-versed in notification management apps. In summary, com.achep.acdisplay is a powerful and visually pleasing notification management application, featuring an attractive user interface, a wide array of customization options, and notable battery-saving properties. Although there are a few drawbacks, such as the occasional app bug, the need for a more user-friendly setup process, and the absence of clear feature instructions, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Despite these shortcomings, I still confidently recommend this app to anyone looking for a versatile and modern approach to their device's lock screen and notification management. With a few improvements, I could easily see this app earning a perfect 5-star rating in the future. Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4/5"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: As a professor I have grown accustomed to the opinion regarding American education. We are repeatedly told that American schools are failing, that colleges are not teaching, and that the students of today are not as good as the students of the past. There are, of course, problems with the education system. Because of economic inequality some schools are significantly better than others and the ideas of equality of education and equality of opportunity are cruel jokes. However, the mere fact that there are some serious problems does not mean that all the _ claims are true. One stock claim is that America has fallen behind the world in education in terms of performance on various tests. While the fact that America is behind other countries is a point of concern, there are at least three points worth considering here. The first is the above-mentioned economic inequality which will tend to result in poorer performance when taking the average for America. The second is that many countries have put considerable effort into improving their education systems and hence it is worth considering that America's decline is also due to the improvement of others. The third is the matter of the measures-- do they, in fact, present an accurate picture of the situation? I am not claiming that the data is bad. I am merely raising a reasonable concern about how accurate our picture of education is at this time. Another stock claim is that American students are doing badly on standardized tests. While there is clearly value in assessment, it is reasonable to consider whether or not such tests are a proper and adequate measure of education. It is also worth considering whether the puzzle with these tests is itself causing damage to education. That is, as teachers teach for the test and students learn for the test, it might be the case that what is being taught is not what should be taught and what is being learned is not what should be learned.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who, according a Village performer, \\"start[ed] singing ['Hard Rain']...finished singing it, and no one could say anything\\"? Dylan was only 21 years old when he wrote one of his most complex songs, \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\", often referred to as \\"Hard Rain\\". Dylan is said to have premiered \\"Hard Rain\\" at the Gaslight Cafe, where Village performer Peter Blankfield recalled: \\"He put out these pieces of loose-leaf paper ripped out of a spiral notebook. And he starts singing ['Hard Rain'] ... He finished singing it, and no one could say anything. The length of it, the episodic sense of it. Every line kept building and bursting\\". Dylan performed \\"Hard Rain\\" days later at Carnegie Hall on September 22, 1962, as part of a concert organized by Pete Seeger. The song gained added resonance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, just one month after Dylan's first performance of \\"Hard Rain\\", when U.S. President John F. Kennedy gave his warning to the Soviet Union over their deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba, . Critics have interpreted the lyric 'hard rain' as a reference to nuclear fallout, but Dylan resisted the specificity of this interpretation. In a radio interview with Studs Terkel in 1963, Dylan said, \\"No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen … In the last verse, when I say, 'the pellets of poison are flooding the waters', that means all the lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers.\\" Many people were astonished by the power and complexity of this work. For Robert Shelton, who had given Dylan an important boost in his 1961 review in The New York Times, this song was \\"a landmark in topical, folk-based songwriting. Here blooms the promised fruit of the 1950s poetry-jazz fusion of Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, and Rexroth.\\" Folk singer Dave Van Ronk later commented: \\"I was acutely aware that it represented the beginning of an artistic revolution.\\" Pete Seeger expressed the opinion that this song would last longer than any other written by Dylan.

At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos.

Patrick Michael Rafter (born 28 December 1972) is an Australian former professional tennis player. He reached the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) world No. 1 singles ranking on July 26, 1999. His career highlights include consecutive US Open titles in 1997 and 1998 and consecutive runner-up at Wimbledon in 2000 and 2001. His ranking had fallen to No. 21 by the time he reached the Wimbledon final in July 2000. In the semifinals, Rafter defeated Agassi 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3. The match was hailed as a classic, particularly because of their contrasting playing styles, with Agassi playing primarily from the baseline and Rafter attacking the net. Rafter faced Sampras in the final, who was gunning for a record-breaking seventh Wimbledon title overall (and seven in the past eight years). While Rafter made a strong start to the match and took the first set, after the match he would claim that he had \\"choked\\" part way through the second set, and was then not able to get back into his game. Sampras won in four sets. In 2001, Rafter reached the semifinals of the Australian Open, but despite holding a two sets to one lead and having the support of the home crowd, Rafter lost the match to Agassi in five sets. Later in the year, Rafter again reached the Wimbledon final. For the third straight year, he faced Agassi in the semifinals and won in yet another five-setter, 2-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 8-6. Much like the previous year's semifinal, this match also received praise for the quality of play that the two men displayed. In the final, he squared off against Goran Ivanisevic, who had reached the Wimbledon final three times before but had slid down the rankings to World No. 125 following injury problems. In a five-set struggle that lasted just over three hours, Ivanisevic prevailed. He played his last match before his unexpected retirement at the Davis Cup final, winning the singles rubber but losing the doubles rubber. Rafter announced his retirement at the end of the year, stating that he had lost all motivation to compete at the top level, after not playing any matches during the season to recover from injuries.

I've been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons: 1) This is, without doubt, the worst film i've ever seen 2) Unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list - which it deserves to be 3) I was kinda lucky - i paid five pound for it. i've seen it in shops for 15 pound. DON NOT PAY THAT MUCH FOR THIS FILM! You will be very angry 4) There are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating (in my opinion) and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal The plot summary: a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well, the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else. Our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings, baby-sitting. He kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police. Why is it so bad? To begin with the acting is VERY VERY bad. Someone else compared it to a school production. No, this is worse than any acting i've seen on a school stage. I've bought a number of these previously banned films from the DVD company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this. okay, the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense.

Math Problem Solve 0 = -136*d + 1014 - 334 for d.","completion":"Alright, we have a math problem to solve for \\"d\\". Let's make it simple for you to understand. Here is the math problem we need to solve: 0 = -136*d + 1014 - 334 First, we need to simplify the equation. We have two numbers, 1014 and -334, that we need to combine. When we do that, 1014 - 334 equals 680: 0 = -136*d + 680 Now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -136*d + 680 We want to find \\"d\\", so we need to move the 680 to the other side of the equation. To do that, we take 680 away from both sides: 0 - 680 = -136*d Now our equation looks like this: -680 = -136*d Next, we need to find \\"d\\" by getting rid of the -136 that is attached to it. To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -136: -680 / -136 = -136*d / -136 Doing the math, -680 / -136 equals 5, so now our equation looks like this: 5 = d So, the answer is that d equals 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.

Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties.

Select from: (a). no; (b). yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"(a). no The answer \\"There will be no negative consequences\\" is incorrect because the passage clearly states there will be consequences to the funding cuts, which will affect Michigan's poor population.

The reductions will be seen in various civil legal matters like landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, and more.

Article: Health experts have discovered that adding low-calorie vegetable soup to the start of a meal can actually help to lose weight. Because you feel full sooner, you eat less of your main course. The soup regime was tested by researchers at Pennsylvania State University, led by Dr Barbara Rolls. They found that when people ate a first course of soup before lunch they reduced their total calorie intake by 20 per cent, compared with those who did not begin the meal with soup. But those who _ creamy soups should be careful.Researchers stressed the soup must be low-calorie and based on stock , not cream. All of the soups tested in the study were made from identical ingredients - chicken stock , broccoli , potato, cauliflower and carrots. They were mixed together to create four different textures and thickness from separate stock and vegetables through to pureed soup. Scientists thought that thick soups with chunks of vegetables which required chewing might be more filling, but to their surprise they found all forms had the same effect. The findings were presented to the Experimental Biology conference in Washington, DC, and the research was part-funded by the National Institutes of Health.

Write an article based on this summary: – As investigators look into the likelihood that al-Qaeda was behind the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi last week, CNN reports that Chris Stevens, the US ambassador killed in the attack, believed he was on an al-Qaeda hit list. A source says Stevens had become increasingly worried about security in Benghazi and al-Qaeda's growing influence in Libya. And intelligence sources tell Fox News investigators do believe al-Qaeda was behind the attack—specifically Sufyan Ben Qumu, a former Guantanamo detainee, who was involved and may even have led the attack. Qumu was returned to his native Libya in 2007 on the condition that he be kept in custody, but was released by the Gadhafi regime the following year. Counterterrorism officials also tell the Wall Street Journal they are probing possible al-Qaeda links to the attack. \\"We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to al-Qaeda or al-Qaeda's affiliates, in particular, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb,\\" the director of the National Counterterrorism Center testified before a Senate committee yesterday, calling the assault \\"a terrorist attack.\\" He described the attack as an \\"opportunistic attack\\" that \\"evolved and escalated over several hours,\\" but said there is no specific intelligence that there was \\"significant advanced planning or coordination for this attack.\\" Libya's president says the attack was planned by foreigners who had entered Libya months earlier.","completion":"Title: Al-Qaeda Suspected In Benghazi Attack That Killed US Ambassador Chris Stevens As investigators dig deeper into the recent attack on the US consulate in Benghazi that resulted in the tragic death of US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, there is growing evidence suggesting that al-Qaeda might have been responsible for the heinous act. According to a CNN report, a worrying possibility has emerged that, at the time, Stevens believed he was on an al-Qaeda hit list. Moreover, a source has claimed that Stevens voiced increasing concerns over the security conditions in Benghazi and al-Qaeda's expanding influence in Libya. Various intelligence sources have spoken to Fox News, stating that they strongly suspect al-Qaeda to have orchestrated the attack. The individual pinpointed as the driving force behind the assault is Sufyan Ben Qumu, a native Libyan and former Guantanamo detainee. It is reported that Qumu may not only have participated in the attack, but could potentially have been the leader. Qumu was returned to Libya in 2007 under the condition that he would remain in custody. However, he was released by the Gadhafi regime in the following year. Counterterrorism officials have also informed the Wall Street Journal that they are currently investigating the potential connections between al-Qaeda and the attack on the US consulate. In a testimony to the Senate committee, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center stated, \\"We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to al-Qaeda or al-Qaeda's affiliates, in particular, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.\\" The director labeled the assault as a \\"terrorist attack\\" and depicted it as an \\"opportunistic attack\\" that \\"evolved and escalated over several hours.\\" However, he also pointed out that there was no specific intelligence to suggest that the assault had involved substantial advanced planning or coordination. Libya's president has further added to the investigation by asserting that the attack was likely premeditated by foreigners who had infiltrated Libya several months prior. The suspicion of al-Qaeda's involvement in this tragic event adds urgency to the ongoing investigation and raises critical questions about the growing influence of the terrorist organization in the region. As developments continue to surface, the US and Libyan governments must work together to bring the perpetrators to justice and prevent the resurgence of extremist threats in the area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Meir David HaKohen Kahane (; Hebrew: myr dvd khn; August 1, 1932 - November 5, 1990) was an American-Israeli ordained Orthodox rabbi, writer, and ultra-nationalist politician who served one term in the Israeli Knesset. His work is influential on most modern Jewish militant and far right-wing political groups. Kahane spent years reaching out to Jews through published works, weekly articles, speeches, and debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States, and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows. Martin David Kahane was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1932 to an Orthodox Jewish family. His father, Yechezkel (Charles) Kahane, the author of the \\"Torah Yesharah\\", studied at Polish and Czech yeshivas, was involved in the Revisionist Zionist movement, and was a close friend of Ze'ev Jabotinsky. As a teenager, Kahane became an ardent admirer of Ze'ev Jabotinsky and Peter Bergson, who were frequent guests in his parents' home, and he joined the Betar (Brit Trumpeldor) youth wing of Revisionist Zionism. He was active in protests against Ernest Bevin, the British Foreign Secretary who maintained restrictions on the immigration of Jews (even Nazi death camp survivors) to Palestine after the end of the Second World War. In 1947, Kahane was arrested for throwing eggs and tomatoes at Bevin, as the latter disembarked at Pier 84 on a visit to New York. A photo of the arrest appeared in the New York Daily News. In 1954, he became the mazkir (director) of Greater New York City's sixteen Bnei Akiva chapters. Kahane's formal education included elementary school at the Yeshiva of Flatbush, and he attended high school at both Abraham Lincoln H.S. and the Brooklyn Talmudical Academy. Kahane received his rabbinical ordination from the Mir Yeshiva in Brooklyn, where he was especially admired by the head, Rabbi Abraham Kalmanowitz, and he began going by his Hebrew name, Meir. He was fully conversant in the Tanakh (Jewish Bible), the Talmud, the Midrash, and Jewish law. Subsequently, Kahane earned a B.A. in Political Science from Brooklyn College, a Bachelor of Law - LL.B. from New York Law School, and an M.A. in International Relations from New York University.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This show had a lot of hype but I didn't know about it until the midseason (season 1). Someone even recommended the show to me. But I decided that if I was going to watch it, I was going to wait until the end of the season so I could watch it in bulk. Due to the show's format, I'm happy I waited. I imagine it would have been fairly annoying have nearly every episode end in the middle of some cliff hanger then have to wait another week to find out what happens in the next second of the story. Somehow, this show has managed to throw in too much sex. Jason will have sex with pretty much anything that moves. Right after he finds out that one woman he had sex with was killed, he's in bed with another woman the next night! Then Tara and Sam get it on, despite each of them knowing that Sam is in love with Sookie. And for some reason, Sookie gets mad when she later finds out about it--even though she's sleeping with a vampire. One of the problems with the show, is that it doesn't do a good job of making you care about the characters. I really didn't care for Jason at all. Along with his endless pursuit of tale, he was rude to the people who actually were concerned for him. After a few episodes, I wouldn't have minded if he got killed somehow. For that reason, I was for the most part uninterested in the murders until Sookie's Grandmother became a victim (since the first two were more closely involved with Jason). Then once Sookie and Bill have sex, the story gets a few more subplots. Tara's mother wants an exorcism, then the exorcist lady tries to convince Tara that she should have one to remove her own demon. I wasn't so much bothered by the whole exorcism thing as I know there are some people who really believe in that stuff. However, they waste little time in showing that is it a farce right after Tara spends about 1300 on exorcisms for her and her mother. At other points, some of the developments happen too fast. Jason continues being a jerk, trying to sell his Grandmother's stuff to buy vampire blood, which apparently is the new crack or something. In his search he finds this girl who will do V (vampire blood) with him. They get high, and within three days fall in love with each other and kidnap a vampire for a constant source of V. Another example is when Bill has to go to a vampire tribunal. He's only gone for two days before Sookie starts to feel abandoned and start to wonder if he thinks \\"vampire politics\\" are more important than her. Subtlety is not this show's strong suit. It doesn't take a genius to figure out something is going on with the local dog. Although my assumption wasn't dead on, it wasn't that much of a surprise. But the finale two episodes was where it really got annoying as it just shoved all the developments in your face as if you couldn't possibly figure the out for yourself. When Tara gets into the car accident, the naked lady's face with the pig is clearly shown, and was easily recognizable when she shows up at the jail for the bailout. As if that wasn't enough, they later show the lady again with the pig at her house. Then it's time to wrap up the murder story. At the end of the penultimate episode, it's revealed that Renee is not who he says he is and most likely is the killer. In the final episode, they shove Renee being the killer in your face. Sookie remarks that it's odd that Renee's thoughts don't have an accent. I thought that was fine, as it adds to Renee being a fraud. But the next scene is full of incriminating evidence against Renee. They show that Renee has the tape of Maudette with the vampire and his fiancée finds a tape in one of Renee's boxes about how to fake a Cajun accent. At this point it was just ridiculous. I mean WE GET IT!!! So blah blah blah stuff happens. Bill almost kills himself while failing to save Sookie, who still manages to kill Renee. They start to set up season 2 by leaving unfinished issues. The naked pig lady and Sam have a history, Lafayette has gone missing and might have been killed. Jason is in the process of being brainwashed into being a religious nut by some anti-vampire church--which makes me care about him even less. It's almost surprising to see how many people absolutely love this show. I think I just expected this show to be better. I'm interested in seeing what happens in season 2, but if I watch it, I'll most likely wait for the season completion. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

I need a new camera and wanted to give my business to someone local rather than shopping online or at one of the big box stores. I went in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday and there appeared to be three people working. Each was helping a customer when I came in. Cool. I'll just take a look at the specs of the cameras while I wait to see if I can narrow it down. Hmmm....only a handful of the cameras in the case had a spec card on them and they weren't the type I was looking for. With nothing to look at, I just hung out at the counter, trying not to feel like a tool. Then I realized that no one had so much as nodded at me since I had come into the store. I didn't expect them to come running to help me; they were busy. But no one likes to feel ignored. It was obvious that I wasn't just browsing for fun. It was clear I was there to look at something in the case and was waiting to be helped. It would take 2 seconds for one of the employees to glance at me, possibly give a half-aed smile, and say something to the effect of \\"I'll be right with you.\\" Yay! I'd at least know that someone was aware that I was in the store! I don't want to jump to conclusions, because the employees were maybe just poorly trained or all having a bad day, but was it possible I was being ignored because of my appearance?

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security... Question: When did Moon Jae-in urge the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to repair relations and have a summit? Options: A. after June 12 B. not enough information C. on June 12 D.

Sam uses firework gear to blow him up Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Shadows of Freedom\\" Act 1: \\"Shadows of Freedom\\" kicks off with an introduction to Congressman Robert Clifton, a charismatic yet corrupt figure possessing immense power and influence in Washington D.C. Despite his charm and elegant facade, he has a host of ruthless enemies due to his draconian policies and the various shady deals he has sealed behind closed bureaucratic doors. Moving into the heart of Washington D.C., we introduce our protagonist, Sam, a seemingly average blue-collar worker with a unique past. Sam, who was once an expert in pyrotechnics has now relinquished his exciting life for the mundanity of a firefighter’s duty. Unbeknownst to those around him, Sam's proficiency with explosives resulted from a stint with the U.S. military in an elite EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit. Act 2: After crossing paths with Clifton at a political rally, where Clifton's ignoble and wicked ways were on full display, Sam's indignation surges. Meanwhile, his deeper past is revealed - his brother was ruined by a policy Clifton advocated, leaving his family desolate, which resulted in his brother's tragic suicide. The plot thickens as Sam is approached by a cryptic group that calls themselves \\"The Vanguard of Liberty.\\" This organization comprises citizens deeply wronged by Clifton's actions, and they task Sam with using his old skills to orchestrate Clifton’s death in a way that sparks questions rather than providing answers - a grand fireworks display during an independence day rally. Act 3: Sam initially refuses, torn over using his skills for such a destructive purpose. However, remembering his brother's death and the suffering of countless other families due to the congressman's policies, he finally agrees. Meanwhile, the Congressman continues his reckless streak of exploitation and corruption, further highlighting his deservingness of the fate planned for him. Sam's meticulous prep begins with stakes escalating with each passing minute. He stealthily gathers materials, designs the damning fireworks scheme, and infiltrates the team overseeing the Independence Day rally's fireworks, all while navigating around prying federal agencies and the watchful eyes of Clifton's private security. Act 4: Finally, the day arrives. The tension mounts as Sam's plan goes into motion. The feel of the event is festive, far from the imminent chaos about to ensue. As Sam's heartbeat synchronises with the ticking clock, the Congressman takes the stage, unknowing of his impending doom. Just as the congressman's pompous speech reaches it's peak, the firework gear planted by Sam detonates, not in the sky as part of the planned spectacle, but on stage, enveloping Clifton in an inferno of colored flames; a spectacle morbid yet mesmerising. Act 5: Before anyone can comprehend the chaotic scene, Sam swiftly slips away, minutes from being exposed by a suspicious security officer. The news of Clifton's violent death spreads like wildfire, and while an atmosphere of shock and horror envelopes Washington, there is a silent sigh of relief amongst the disenfranchised masses. In the closing scenes, we see Sam, lying low, watching the consequences of his actions on a small TV in a roadside diner. While there is regret for the chaos he caused, he finds solace in his belief of having served justice. The movie ends with Sam's sigh of relief, leaving the audience to wonder if Sam will be able to live a normal life or if he will be pursued. In conclusion, \\"Shadows of Freedom” is a riveting political thriller that explores themes of power, corruption, vengeance, and justice, all set against the backdrop of a tumultuous political climate – making for an unforgettable cinematic experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If I had to take a guess, you probably celebrate New Year's Day surrounded by family and friends, enjoying drinks of your choice (probably wine and champagne) and watching the ball drop. If you're particularly lucky, perhaps you share a kiss with that special someone when the clock hits 00:00am. Have you ever imagined how New Year's Day would look in another country? Listed below are five of the top ten \\"Unique New Year Traditions from Around the World.\\" 1. Breaking Dishes on Neighbor's Door----Denmark A strange and weird Danish New Year tradition, depending on how you look at it, is throwing dishes at neighbor's door. Strangely, this makes them happy instead of annoying them. The family with the tallest tower of broken plates, glasses, cups and other crockery is considered to be the luckiest person because it symbolizes their large amount of loyal friends. 2. Talking to Spirits----Mexico Talking to spirits is a part of Mexican belief. Mexicans strongly believe that they can communicate with the souls of their dead loved ones. New Year's Eve is considered the best time to communicate with dead spirits to convey a message or ask for guidance. And this is not done at home on an individual basis but is a legal Mexican practice. Taos Inn, in New Mexico for example, offers 15 minutes session of spiritualism and meditation for 15. Not a bad price for some helpful guidance! 3. Wearing Polka Dots ----Philippines Imagine streets full of people wearing polka dots and dining room tables full of round shaped food and fruits on one single day of the year. This all actually happens in the Philippines on New Year's Eve every year. Philippines believe that this will bring them prosperity by associating the round dots to coins and wealth. 4.

As midnight approaches, everyone gathers outside... Question: What can you learn when you are paying a visiting to Mexico during New Year's Day?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Is JLo-Drake relationship just for show? Drake and Jennifer Lopez will do whatever it takes to promote their new music together — even cuddle on Instagram. Lopez, 46, posted a photo of herself wrapped in the 30-year-old rapper’s arms on Tuesday. Drake posted the same exact photo. Neither party captioned the image, leaving it up to speculation as to what exactly was going on, whether it be a new romance or a classic publicity stunt for music they’re reportedly working on together. It’s not the first cutesy snap the pair have shared. On Dec. 11, Lopez posted a photo of a grinning Drake visiting her Las Vegas residency, captioning the photo, “Look who rolled up to my show tonight to say hi!! @champagnepapi #lovehim.” Drake posted the same photo, accompanied by a heart-eyes emoji. A source previously told Page Six that Lopez bailed on her scheduled New Year’s Eve performance in Miami to “hang out” with Drizzy in Las Vegas — and eagle-eyed fans noted that Drake’s on-again-off-again ex, Rihanna, unfollowed Lopez on Instagram.

On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"Older version\\"","completion":"In order to provide a rating for the given review, it is necessary to elaborate on the context of the review, as the given text \\"Older version\\" does not provide sufficient information. However, I will attempt to provide a detailed analysis of the potential meanings and how they could be evaluated on a scale of 1 to 5. 1. If \\"Older version\\" refers to a user's preference in favor of an older version of a product or software over a newer one, it would depend on the specific reasons for this preference. - If the user provides a detailed explanation highlighting specific features or aspects of the older version, which they find more favorable than the newer version, the rating could be around 4-5. - If the user simply states their preference without providing any reasons, it's difficult to evaluate the review, so the rating falls around 3. - If the user complains about the older version without any constructive feedback, it would deserve a 1. 2. If \\"Older version\\" refers to a comparison between an older and newer model of a gadget or device: - If the user provides a comprehensive and detailed comparison of the two versions, showcasing the benefits and drawbacks of the older version, it would earn a rating of 4-5. - If the user only provides brief information about the older version, with minimal elaboration, the rating would be around 3. - If the user's review is negative without any constructive feedback, it would warrant a rating of 1-2. 3. If \\"Older version\\" refers to the user's experience with an older version of an application or product, without any comparison to the newer versions: - If the user shares an insightful explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of the older version, it would receive a high rating of 5. - If the user provides some information, but fails to delve into details, the rating would fall closer to a 3-4. - If the user's review is vague and lacks valuable information, it would receive a low rating of 1-2. In summary, without additional context, it is difficult to definitively rate the \\"Older version\\" review on a scale of 1-5. However, based on possible interpretations and the level of detail provided, the rating could range from 1 to 5.

Most people want to be happy but few know how to find happiness. Money and success don't bring lasting happiness. Happiness depends on ourselves. In other words, we make our own happiness. Some people believe that if they are _ , they will be able to do anything they want, which means happiness. On the other hand, some people believe that holding a high position in the government is happiness. In this way, you have not only money, but also many other things which can't be bought by money. However, other people believe that having lots of money is not happiness, nor is holding a high position in the government. These people value their beliefs, or their intelligence, or their health. They think these can make them happy. Here are a few ways to help you be happier. The first secret of happiness is to enjoy the simple things in life. Too often, we spend so much time thinking about the future, for example, getting into college or getting a good job, that we don't enjoy the present. You should enjoy life's simple pleasures, such as reading a good book, listening to your favorite music, or spending time with close friends. People who have close friends usually enjoy happier and healthier lives. The second secret of happiness is to be active. Many people go dancing or play sports. People can forget about their problems and only think about the activities. Finally, many people find happiness in helping others. According to studies, people feel good when they volunteer their time to do many meaningful things for other people. If you want to feel happier, do something nice for someone. You can help a friend with his or her studies, go shopping to get food for an old neighbor, or simply help around the house. Now maybe you know how to find happiness!

Question: when was coca cola invented? Would \\"The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains to major restaurants and food service distributors.\\" be a reasonable answer?

Here's a detailed and long answer for the question: Coca-Cola, the world-famous soft drink, was invented on May 8, 1886, by Dr. John Stith Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. Pemberton was experimenting with finding a new beverage that could be viewed as a patent medicine despite the recent implementation of the Pure Food and Drug Act in the United States. As a result, he came up with a non-alcoholic version of his coca wine, which he named \\"Coca-Cola,\\" a combination of the words \\"coca\\" and \\"kola,\\" after two of the main ingredients used in the beverage at that time: coca leaves and kola nuts. Initially, Pemberton started selling Coca-Cola as a syrup that could be mixed with carbonated water. He marketed it as a \\"brain tonic\\" and a remedy for various ailments. The syrup was first sold at Jacobs' Pharmacy in Atlanta for five cents per glass. Frank M. Robinson, Pemberton's bookkeeper, suggested the name Coca-Cola and designed the distinctive script that is still used for the product's branding today. In 1888, Pemberton sold his interest in Coca-Cola to Asa Griggs Candler, another pharmacist from Atlanta, who saw the commercial potential of the beverage. Candler aggressively marketed the product, establishing The Coca-Cola Company in 1892. Under Candler's leadership, Coca-Cola gained rapid popularity and expanded nationwide. The formula for Coca-Cola, also known as \\"Merchandise 7X,\\" underwent a few changes due to the ban of coca leaf importation to the United States in the early 1900s. The coca leaves used in the early formulation were stripped of most of their psychoactive alkaloids, and even today, the leaves continue to be part of the recipe but with a non-narcotic form. Regarding the statement about Coca-Cola selling concentrate to soda fountains, restaurants, and food service distributors, this is an important aspect of the company's business. The Coca-Cola Company has a wide distribution network that provides its products to millions of consumers worldwide. By supplying concentrate to these establishments, Coca-Cola ensures its presence and availability in a vast array of distribution channels, helping it maintain its status as one of the world's leading beverage companies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water.

Summarize the following: The bilirubin production system can run into trouble at one of three points: before, during, and after bilirubin production. Each of these problems can result from a set of related conditions: Adults can develop what is called \\"unconjugated jaundice\\" when the problem occurs before bilirubin is produced. This is most often caused by reabsorption of a large blood clot or by hemolytic anemia. During the production of bilirubin, adults can develop jaundice as a result of viruses such as hepatitis and Epstein-Barr, autoimmune disorders, and overconsumption of alcohol or certain medications including acetaminophen, oral contraceptives, and steroids. If the adult develops jaundice because of problems after bilirubin production, the problem may lie in the gallbladder or pancreas. If you have jaundice, you will want to have your bilirubin levels checked. Jaundice can be an indication of a serious health issue. Usually, your doctor will work to find and treat the cause of your jaundice and treat any complications of the jaundice. The jaundice itself is not usually treated. Sometimes a medication may be given to help with itching, which is a common symptom of jaundice. Jaundice is often accompanied by other symptoms, which may help your doctor determine the cause: Short term jaundice, which is caused by infection, may be accompanied by chills, fever, abdominal discomfort, or other flu-like symptoms. Jaundice caused by cholestasis -- the interruption of the flow of bile -- may be accompanied by itching, weight loss, darkened urine, or lightened stools. A number of uncommon medical disorders can lead to elevated bilirubin and jaundice. Gilbert syndrome is a genetic liver disorder. Patients have a reduced amount of the liver enzyme needed to break down bilirubin. Although present from birth, symptoms, which include jaundice, fatigue, weakness, and gastrointestinal discomfort, may not appear until young adulthood. Crigler-Najjar disease is an extremely rare condition that is also caused by an enzyme deficiency. There are two types of this disease; the more common one, called Arias' syndrome, can be treated so that patients can live a normal or near-normal lifespan. People with sickle cell anemia or other blood disorders also have a higher risk of jaundice. Alcohol can damage the liver, which leads to increased bilirubin levels, so limit your consumption to the recommended daily allowance (1-2 drinks per day depending on your age). Some people may be advised to completely eliminate alcohol consumption. Alcohol can damage the liver in three ways: By leaving excess fat in liver cells. This condition is known as fatty liver disease. Many people who have this condition do not experience symptoms, but those who do may experience discomfort and fatigue. By causing scarring and inflammation of the liver. These symptoms may indicate alcoholic hepatitis. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, and fever. Alcoholic hepatitis can sometimes be reversed by abstaining from alcohol. This can also be caused by viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis. By disrupting the functioning of the liver. Cirrhosis of the liver is characterized by severe scarring of the liver and disruption of its ability to process food and to remove harmful substances from the blood. Studies have shown that obesity can be more damaging to the liver than alcohol consumption. Obesity can lead to fatty liver, even in children. Foods that are high in fiber are particularly good for the liver, including fruits and vegetables and whole grains. Certain foods are more likely to damage the liver, including those high in fat, sugar, or salt. Other foods that may damage the liver include fried food and raw or undercooked shellfish. Hepatitis A, B, and C are all viruses that negatively affect the liver. Avoid contracting the disease by taking precautions: Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for everyone starting shortly after birth. Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for certain high-risk people or those traveling to high-risk areas. If you are traveling to areas of the world with high rates of hepatitis, get vaccinated before leaving. Hepatitis can also be contracted through risky behaviors such as intravenous drug use and unprotected sex. Be aware that some medications, including over-the-counter pain medication and common prescription drugs such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, antibiotics, and anabolic steroids, can cause toxic hepatitis. Talk to your doctor if you are unsure if you are taking medications that may be harming your liver. Some alternative medicines thought to improve liver health and function have actually been linked to liver damage. Consult your doctor before taking alternative medicines. Some of the commonly used herbs that can damage your liver include green tea, kava, comfrey, mistletoe, Chaparral, and skullcap. The liver is responsible for breaking down medications, and it is possible for them to cause damage during this process. Acetaminophen is the most commonly used over the counter medication that can damage the liver. Summary:","completion":"The bilirubin production system can encounter issues at different points, leading to jaundice in adults. Problems can arise before, during, or after bilirubin production. Unconjugated jaundice occurs before bilirubin production, while viruses, autoimmune disorders, and certain medications can cause jaundice during production. Issues with the gallbladder or pancreas can result in jaundice after production. Symptoms may include flu-like symptoms, itching, weight loss, or gastrointestinal discomfort. Certain disorders, like Gilbert syndrome or Crigler-Najjar disease, can also cause elevated bilirubin levels. Alcohol consumption and obesity can damage the liver, leading to increased bilirubin levels. High-fiber foods are beneficial for the liver, while high-fat, sugary, or salty foods can be harmful. Hepatitis A, B, and C can negatively impact the liver; vaccinations and precautions are recommended. Some medications, alternative medicines, and herbs can potentially damage the liver; consult a doctor before taking these.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.

But if you thought the end of your last relationship was awkward, spare a thought for these former lovers whose text messages to their ex-partners have been shared with the world via a new Instagram feed. Texts From Your Ex promises the spurned lovers, or the ones who broke their hearts the chance to share the most cringeworthy, angry, and sometimes heartbreaking messages sent by their one-time paramour. Promising 'real texts from real exes', the account invites former boyfriends and girlfriends the chance to vent their anger, or share their amusement, by sending screenshots of the SMS conversations in via email, or through Instagram. Already the account has nearly 85,000 followers, with 44 posts uploaded to the photo-sharing site since it was set up a month ago. Here are some of the best... and worst. At least he has his mother: This boyfriend failed to win back the affection of his one-time flame by sharing that his mother had made him a 'delicious' meatloaf out of a gift of meat from his ex before their split. Sadly Kayley was not impressed. Not so pukka: Handing back each others possessions can be one of the hardest parts about a break up. And this former flame seems to want to give it one more shot before requesting the return of a Jamie Oliver book. Got the message yet? This former spouse's request to meet up for a drink didn't go down too well, and was followed by a question on the correct way to refer to divorce proceedings... before their conversation was shared with Texts From Your Ex on Instagram. Polite request: This goodnight message was met with more than a little anger from 'Adam's girlfriend', but she was kind enough to offer him up to her love rival when she is finished with him. B is for bad break up: Telling your ex they smell and look like a Sesame Street character might not go down too well a year after the end of your relationship, even if they do remind you of Cookie Monster. That clean feeling: After seven months you might think this ex-partner would have replaced their toothbrush. Anger: This spurned lover seems more than a little angry at their ex's advice to 'chill' and subsequent apology. Short and to the point? The anger behind this text message seems to be coming through loud and clear. Trying to make it work: Not even the promise of a wedding and a baby is likely to get this man back in his ex-girlfriend's good books after taking money from her wallet. Unsubscribe: This former partner's hopes of dealing with their ex-love in much the same way as an unwanted email does not appear to be working. A change of heart: Most exes find it a struggle to remember not to drink and text, and this drinker's attempt at covering their texting tracks wasn't much of a success either. Devil in disguise: Calling someone Satan is perhaps a little mean, but this former partner didn't seem to be picking up on the fact their ex did not want to talk. Heartfelt: Perhaps it took this ex-partner a long time to figure out their former lover wasn't really interested.","completion":"A new Instagram account called \\"Texts From Your Ex\\" has gained nearly 85,000 followers since its creation just a month ago. The account allows former partners to share cringeworthy, angry, and heartbreaking messages from their ex-lovers, providing a platform for both venting anger and finding amusement in the aftermath of breakups. By sharing the intimate text conversations, the account highlights the diverse range of emotional responses that can come from ending a relationship. Featured highlights include awkward attempts at reconciliation and jealousy-induced insults. In one case, a former boyfriend tries to win back his ex by sharing that his mother made a \\"delicious\\" meatloaf from a meat gift she had given him prior to their split, much to the ex's disinterest. In another instance, an angry ex tells her former partner that he resembles a Sesame Street character—a Cookie Monster alternative. The account also showcases the lengths to which exes will go in order to communicate their frustrations or needs. One message from a recently separated spouse requests a meeting for a drink, followed by questions about the correct terminology for their divorce proceedings. Another carries a pleading tone, as an ex-girlfriend offers her current partner to a love rival once she is \\"finished\\" with him. Other posts reveal desperate attempts to make amends and find peace, like one text in which an intoxicated ex tries and fails to \\"unsubscribe\\" from the other's life. Multiple messages portray former partners attempting to salvage relationships by proposing weddings or discussing future plans like having a baby. \\"Texts From Your Ex\\" remains a compelling and relatable reminder of the complex emotions and challenges that can follow the end of a relationship.

Now this is perhaps the first generation of American youngsters who have never been close by during of the birth a baby and have never experienced the death of a family member. Nowadays when people grow old, we often send them to nursing homes. When they get sick, we send them to a hospital, where children are forbidden to visit terminally in patients-- even when those patients are their parents. This deprives the dying patient of family members during the last few days of his life and it deprives the children of an experience of death, which is an important learning experience. Some of my colleagues and I once interviewed and followed about 500 terminally in order to find out what they could teach us and how we could be of more benefit, not just to them but to the members of their families as well. We were most impressed by the fact that even those patients who were not told of their serious illness were quite aware of its potential outcome. It is important for family members, and doctors and nurses to understand these patients' communication in order to truly understand their needs, fears and fantasies . Most of our patients welcomed another human being with whom they could talk openly, honestly, and frankly about their trouble. Many of them shared with us their great need to be informed, to be kept up - to - date on their medical condition and to be told when the end was near. We found out that patients who had been dealt with openly and frankly were better able to cope with the coming of detach and finally to reach a true stage of acceptance before death.

Eat when you’re hungry Eat what you want Eat consciously Stop when you are full The difference lies in the approach and the detail. I will discuss each step in this four part series. ————————————————— EAT WHAT YOU WANT DOES YOUR FOOD SING TO YOU? Have a look in your fridge and cupboards. Does the food in there sing to you, does it call your name, and are you looking forward to eating it? Do you eat it because you enjoy it or because you think you should? By choosing only to eat what sings to me, I have discovered (again!) that I am not a big fan of meat and would rather eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation.

Hillary Clinton Made Me Cry Bozeman, Mont. — “My name is Geraldine Ferraro.” In 1984, those words were, hands down, the most exciting sound I had ever heard coming out of a television. (No offense, Ted Koppel.) I was 14 years old. The morning after the Democrats’ new candidate for vice president introduced herself at the ’84 Democratic National Convention, I cut out her photo from the newspaper and stuck it to the refrigerator. About three minutes later my father walked in, saw the Ferraro clipping and threw it in the trash. He left the room and came back carrying the King James Bible — always a cheerful start to any teenager’s day. He hovered over me, reading aloud, “Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak.” It was from the Apostle Paul’s parenting chapter of First Corinthians subtitled “How to Guarantee Your Daughter Is Hosting Her Own Radio Show by the Time She’s 18.” I rolled my eyes, partly because I came of age in that feminist sweet spot after Roe v. Wade but before the internet was invented as a forum for saying snippy things about Anne Hathaway. And I was attending junior high in Montana, where we were lucky if we had to endure only one lesson plan per year on Missoula’s Jeannette Rankin, who was elected to Congress in 1916 and became, as she put it, “the only woman who ever voted to give women the right to vote.” In my dad’s defense, and in case it might be instructive for the country at large, here’s how we handled the nonstop ideological bickering in our house: The offended party stewed for a day or two. Then everyone either pretended it never happened or the victim healed by making fun of the offender to his or her face for the rest of our lives, as a way of implying, “I forgive you, you sexist Jesus freak,” and “I still love you, you Commie shrew.” Then we went out for tacos. There are few disagreements that cannot be smoothed over by a taco. (Though I suspect that rule might not apply to taco bowls.) I am just a plain writer, as opposed to a female writer, who would be prepared, if I knew much about sports, to agree that Serena Williams is, according to Ms. Williams herself, “one of the greatest athletes of all time” — and not just one of the greatest “female” athletes. Before the convention I had extended Hillary Clinton the feminist courtesy of not caring much about her historic presidential gender. Though at this point in the campaign I mostly care that she is not mentally ill. That and she isn’t contributing to the climate crisis by spewing the sort of unconstitutional nonsense about Muslims that keeps the religion scholar Reza Aslan driving from one TV station after another to re-explain that about a fourth of the world’s population might not be comprised entirely of murderers. I was planning to vote for Mrs. Clinton for the boring reason that she had been my senator in New York, and though I didn’t always agree with her, I thought she did a commendable job. Just as I voted for the president not because he was a transformative racial messiah but because he seemed like a sensible Democrat with emotional intelligence who sure could string a sentence together. That and some of us actually like the people of Hawaii. But the other night when the D.N.C. rolled that montage of non-dame presidential faces I wept so hard I had to open a new box of tissues. I cried like a 14-year-old girl for the 14-year-old girl I once was and because Geraldine Ferraro and Jeannette Rankin did not live to see it. Feeling represented does matter in a representative democracy. (But it matters more to elect the candidate who is not bonkers.) Turns out, there is such a thing as progress. Now we have our first major-party female presidential candidate. Someday we’ll have another, and we might not have to sit through speeches, however charming, about how she’s datable and maternal. Though we might enjoy speeches about how she is at least as datable and maternal as Richard Nixon. We have had our first black president, but he’s the son of an African goat herder. Being the great-granddaughter of a half-Seminole shepherd during the Texas range wars, I am proud that mixed-race heirs of livestock caretakers have finally stormed the executive branch. But getting a commander in chief who is the progeny of the wound of slavery is still on this country’s to-do list. As Michelle Obama pointed out in her convention speech, it’s a very big deal that her daughters, descendants of their mother’s slave ancestors, play with their dogs on the White House lawn, and some day it will be another big deal when we elect the kin of slaves to sit behind the Resolute Desk. If you want that to be you, Senator Cory Booker, start figuring out how to at least mime eating bratwurst. It is reasonable to expect progress but it will be awhile before a vegan escapes the Iowa caucuses intact.

The Eastern Theater refers to a geographic area where military operations took place during the American Civil War, and the information given does not answer the specific question of when and where the Civil War started. The American Civil War began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces opened fire on Fort Sumter, a Union stronghold in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. The attack on Fort Sumter marked the beginning of the war, which lasted until April 9, 1865, when Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. The conflict arose from deep-seated political, economic, and social differences between the Northern and Southern states, most notably concerning the issues of states' rights and the expansion of slavery into newly acquired territories. The Eastern Theater of the American Civil War refers to the major military operations that took place in the eastern United States, particularly in the states of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Key battles and campaigns in the Eastern Theater included the First Battle of Bull Run, the Peninsula Campaign, the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Gettysburg, and General Ulysses S. Grant's campaigns in Virginia in 1864–65. While it is true that the outcome of the war in the Eastern Theater was inconclusive in the early years (1861–62), this information does not address when and where the Civil War actually began.

Question: What is John's nickname? Movie title: Vertigo Movie plot: \\"Madeleine\\" at Golden Gate Bridge, Fort Point, shortly before she jumps into the bay. After a rooftop chase, where his fear of heights and vertigo result in the death of a policeman, San Francisco detective John \\"Scottie\\" Ferguson retires. Scottie tries to conquer his fear, but his friend and ex-fiancÃ©e Midge Wood says that another severe emotional shock may be the only cure. An acquaintance from college, Gavin Elster, asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine, claiming she has been possessed. Scottie reluctantly agrees, and follows Madeleine to a florist where she buys a bouquet of flowers, to the Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s and the grave of Carlotta Valdes, and to an art museum where she gazes at the Portrait of Carlotta. He watches her enter the McKittrick Hotel, but on investigation she does not seem to be there. A local historian explains that Carlotta Valdes tragically committed suicide. Gavin reveals that Carlotta (who he fears is possessing Madeleine) is Madeleine's great-grandmother, although Madeleine has no knowledge of this, and does not remember the places she has visited. Scottie tails Madeleine to Fort Point and, when she leaps into the bay, he rescues her. The next day Scottie follows Madeleine; they meet and spend the day together. They travel to Muir Woods and Cypress Point on 17-Mile Drive, where Madeleine runs down towards the ocean. Scottie grabs her and they embrace. Madeleine recounts a nightmare and Scottie identifies its setting as Mission San Juan Bautista. He drives her there and they express their love for each other. Madeleine suddenly runs into the church and up the bell tower. Scottie, halted on the steps by his vertigo, sees Madeleine plunge to her death. The death is declared a suicide. Gavin does not fault Scottie, but Scottie breaks down, becomes clinically depressed and is in a sanatorium, almost catatonic. After release, Scottie frequents the places that Madeleine visited, often imagining that he sees her. One day, he notices a woman who reminds him of Madeleine,...

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Myelin The insulation for axons in the nervous system is provided by glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the CNS, and Schwann cells in the PNS. Whereas the manner in which either cell is associated with the axon segment, or segments, that it insulates is different, the means of myelinating an axon segment is mostly the same in the two situations. Myelin is a lipid-rich sheath that surrounds the axon and by doing so creates a myelin sheath that facilitates the transmission of electrical signals along the axon. The lipids are essentially the phospholipids of the glial cell membrane. Myelin, however, is more than just the membrane of the glial cell. It also includes important proteins that are integral to that membrane. Some of the proteins help to hold the layers of the glial cell membrane closely together. The appearance of the myelin sheath can be thought of as similar to the pastry wrapped around a hot dog for “pigs in a blanket” or a similar food. The glial cell is wrapped around the axon several times with little to no cytoplasm between the glial cell layers. For oligodendrocytes, the rest of the cell is separate from the myelin sheath as a cell process extends back toward the cell body. A few other processes provide the same insulation for other axon segments in the area. For Schwann cells, the outermost layer of the cell membrane contains cytoplasm and the nucleus of the cell as a bulge on one side of the myelin sheath. During development, the glial cell is loosely or incompletely wrapped around the axon (Figure 12.13a). The edges of this loose enclosure extend toward each other, and one end tucks under the other. The inner edge wraps around the axon, creating several layers, and the other edge closes around the outside so that the axon is completely enclosed. Q: What is the lipid-rich sheath that surrounds the axon and facilitates the transmission of electrical signals along the axon? Choices: - axon sheath - neural sheath - receptors sheath - myelin sheath A: A:","completion":"Myelin sheath"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Why did I go to see a movie at an IMAX theater instead of a regular cinema ?","completion":"You chose to watch The Dark Knight at an IMAX theater instead of a regular cinema for a few reasons, as implied by the context provided in the text. Firstly, the primary reason was to experience the enhanced visual and immersive experience that IMAX theaters offer. This is evident in the mention of the \\"truly awesome\\" shots taken from high vantage points, which were specifically designed for the IMAX format. These shots are indeed exceptional and can have a profound impact on the viewer, making the already great cinematography in The Dark Knight even more breathtaking. IMAX theaters are known for their floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall screens that significantly enhance the visual aspect of a movie, giving the viewer an unparalleled cinematic experience. They make you feel as though you are a part of the movie, and this may have been one of the reasons why you decided to see the film in an IMAX theater. Additionally, movies shown in IMAX theaters typically feature significantly better sound quality compared to regular cinemas, providing an immersive audio experience. The Dark Knight, in particular, features a gripping score by Hans Zimmer, and the audio effects in the movie are intense, so it makes sense that you would want to maximize the impact it would have on you as a viewer. Furthermore, The Dark Knight is a movie with ambitious and visually stunning scenes, so the IMAX format enhances the overall experience, allowing you to appreciate the film's intricate details and vast expanses of the fictional Gotham City. By watching it in an IMAX theater, you can immerse yourself further in the storyline and the world it portrays. Lastly, it is implied that watching The Dark Knight in an IMAX theater was a deliberate choice to revisit the movie and have a different experience than seeing it on a normal sized screen. Perhaps you realized that the IMAX experience would add a new dimension to your appreciation of the film, so you decided to revisit it in the larger-than-life setting. In summary, you went to see The Dark Knight at an IMAX theater instead of a regular cinema because of the enhanced visual and audio experience, as well as the unique opportunity to immerse yourself in the film's impressive cinematography and sound design. Furthermore, it allowed you to revisit the movie with a fresh and expansive perspective, which would not have been possible in a regular cinema."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Eric always wore glasses. 2). Aaron always wore glasses.","completion":"Eric could put things in the eye but not Aaron because Aaron always wore glasses. Aaron's glasses were an essential component of his daily life as they allowed him to see clearly and navigate the world around him. This dependency on glasses, however, also made it challenging for him to engage in tasks that involved putting things into his eyes. The risk of accidentally breaking or scratching his glasses or getting particles trapped between the lenses and his eyes made tasks like this difficult and frustrating. Unlike Aaron, Eric did not wear glasses and had generally better vision. This lack of visual impairment allowed him to have better control and dexterity when engaging in activities that involved putting things in the eye, such as inserting contact lenses or applying eye drops. Additionally, without the presence of glasses obstructing his access to his eyes, Eric could easily explore and engage in eye-related tasks without the fear of causing damage to his glasses or risking discomfort. Moreover, since Aaron always wore glasses, it could be challenging for him to participate in certain sports or physically demanding activities that require unobstructed vision. Additionally, Aaron's reliance on glasses also limited his options for fashion and style, as he needed to consider the compatibility of his glasses with various clothing and accessories. On the other hand, Eric's lack of a reliance on glasses provided him with more freedom and flexibility in various aspects of his life. He wasn't hindered by the potential issues and inconveniences of wearing glasses and could engage in a more diverse range of activities without concern for his vision or eyewear. In conclusion, the statement \\"Eric could put things in the eye but not Aaron because Aaron always wore glasses\\" is an accurate representation of the unique and specific challenges faced by those who depend on glasses for their everyday vision. Though wearing glasses may provide the benefit of improved eyesight for Aaron, it also limits his ability to engage comfortably and effectively in tasks that require direct access to his eyes, such as putting things in them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A positive review would be when someone shares their happy and satisfied experience with a product or service, talking about the things they really enjoyed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Learning a programming language can be like learning how to build with blocks. An easy way to learn is by practicing, you start with one block and then slowly you add more blocks. Now, you don't start with a big castle, do you? Likewise, start with simple tasks in programming and slowly move to more complex ones as you feel more comfortable. To help you with this, there are many resources available. Imagine these as your toy books or guides which help you understand how to better use your blocks. Some fantastic resources for beginners include interactive websites, kids-friendly programming books, and even classes specifically tailored to youngsters. Websites can have fun games that teach programming, and books can simplify difficult concepts into easy to understand stories. And no, those two questions aren't exactly the same, even though they both talk about learning programming. The first question asks for an easy way to learn a programming language, as if you want to know the process or steps to make it simpler. The second one asks for the best resources like books, websites or classes to help learn programming, just like asking for the best toys or books to learn building blocks.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature. But I can use this background: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. What is an answer for this question: Which P.D. took a less comprehensive approach in fighting crime? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, Greenville P.D. took a less comprehensive approach in fighting crime as compared to Grayville. Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures in these areas. The background information suggests that while there might be challenges related to budget, skills, and legal proceedings, adopting modern technological advancements can be crucial in fighting crime effectively.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

What is the best way to: How do you make buttermilk?","completion":"The best way to make buttermilk at home is through a simple process using just two ingredients: milk and an acid (lemon juice or white vinegar). By adding the acid to the milk, you'll create a reaction that thickens and slightly curdles the milk, mimicking the taste and texture of traditional buttermilk. Here's a step-by-step guide on making buttermilk: 1. Gather your ingredients: To make one cup of homemade buttermilk, you'll need one cup of milk (whole, 2%, or even skim) and one tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar. 2. Measure the acid: Using a measuring spoon, measure one tablespoon of your chosen acid (either lemon juice or white vinegar) and pour it into a liquid measuring cup. 3. Measure the milk: Pour milk into the liquid measuring cup containing the acid, filling it up to the one-cup mark. Stir the milk and acid together gently to combine. 4. Allow it to sit: Let the mixture stand at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes. This will give the milk time to thicken and curdle slightly. You'll notice small curdled bits forming; this is normal and an indication that your buttermilk is ready. 5. Stir and use: Once your buttermilk has thickened, give it another gentle stir before using it in your recipe. If you have any leftover, store it in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Homemade buttermilk can be used in various recipes like pancakes, waffles, muffins, biscuits, and fried chicken, offering a tangy flavor and tender texture to your dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are /a/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /o/, and /u/, their long counterparts /aː/, /ɛː/, /iː/, /oː/ and /uː/, and three diphthongs, /ou̯/, /au̯/ and /ɛu̯/. The latter two diphthongs and the long /oː/ are exclusive to loanwords. Vowels are never reduced to schwa sounds when unstressed. Each word usually has primary stress on its first syllable, except for enclitics (minor, monosyllabic, unstressed syllables). In all words of more than two syllables, every odd-numbered syllable receives secondary stress. Stress is unrelated to vowel length, and the possibility of stressed short vowels and unstressed long vowels can be confusing to students whose native language combines the features (such as English). What a few exceptions where is the primary word stress in Czech? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Okay, let me try to explain it in a simple way. In the Czech language, we usually put more force or emphasis on the first part of a word when we say it. This is called \\"primary stress.\\" Most words follow this rule, but there are a few little words, called \\"enclitics,\\" that don't get this emphasis. Instead, enclitics attach to other words and don't get their own emphasis. An example of an enclitic in Czech is the little word \\"ť\\" which means \\"you.\\" In words that are longer and have more than one part or syllable, every other part after the first one also gets a little bit of emphasis, but not as much as the first part. This is called \\"secondary stress.\\" What makes Czech a bit tricky is that how long we hold a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) when we say it doesn't have anything to do with where we put the stress. So, sometimes we say a short vowel with stress, and sometimes we say a long vowel without stress. That can be confusing for people who speak other languages, like English, where the length of the vowel and stress often go together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I end this small run of blog posts with the question posed by Professor Brian Boyd at the beginning of our evening: Do we want to close the achievement gap? We know we can close the gap. It’s been done or almost been done before in Scottish education, but the answers have been ignored as they pass us by. The simple clue is this: poverty is single biggest predictor of achievement, and according to research (Hammonds sic, reference required), aged 10, a child living in poverty is 60% less likely to get to university. Boyd borrowed from his own mother’s report card to ask us what kind of education we desire. Is it the academic success at all costs route, or is there another option we need to value as much, if not more? His mother’s report card, one that prevented her from becoming a secondary school pupil in Glasgow, is filled with G and FG, until the last point: Character and conduct - excellent. What kind of pupils do we want to develop in Scotland? What do we value in our assessment system? Opening up opportunity for all is a tough game to play when the examination system rewards only certain types of behaviour, few of them related to what the Curriculum for Excellence says we stand for. In his own small community in East Kilbride, three secondary schools enter a period of meltdown as the local rag sets about creating its own local league table of performance, with those three ‘teams’ in competition for the top spot (or at least not the bottom one). Therefore, we must stop basing “the gap” largely on attainment. First of all, Boyd would like us to remove the traditional, and non-sensical academic/vocational divide.

Being in the sun exposes the person to external heat, which can potentially alter the body temperature and the rate at which they sweat. However, the basic process of sweating and cooling remains the same. When the person is in the sun, their body will likely produce more sweat to compensate for the additional heat. This increased production of sweat will still follow the same process described, where the sweat evaporates, sheds molecules into the air, turns into a gas, and draws heat from the body. So, while the sun does not directly impact any specific step of the process, it does indirectly impact the amount of sweat produced and the overall effectiveness of the cooling process, making the person feel hotter and possibly impairing their ability to cool down as quickly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Even after centuries of exploration , the ocean still holds its mysteries. Although we know more today about the world's oceans and creatures living in them than ever before, every once in a while the sea brings up something so strange, so unexpected, that makes the world wonder what it could be. Such was the case when the currents of the Mediterranean Ocean recently washed a 13-foot-long, smelly body onto the shores of the village of Villaricos in Andalusia, Spain. An early report in the Spanish publication Lavante described the strange, horned body as what might seem like a big fish, but _ was already in pieces. Locals joked that it was some kind of Loch Ness Monster. The media jumped right on the creature, of course. Some sites called it a horned sea monster. The popular newspaper Boing Boing called it a dragon. Some people guessed that it might be an oarfish , which is actually a rarely seen kind of big fish that can grow up to 55 feet long. But now the experts have weighed in and we're sorry to report that it's not a dragon, a Loch Ness Monster, or even an oarfish. \\"That is actually a shark skeleton ,\\" Professor Grubbs from Florida State University told NBC News. \\"The parts toward the back were confusing me, but those are the lower caudal fin supports. The \\"horns\\" are the scapulocoracoids which support the pectoral fins .\\" Scapulocoracoids are backbones common to many animals. So there we go, another mystery solved. Well, the ancient maps that once described areas of the ocean as places of dragons have yet to be proven true.

OPTIONS: --negative --positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere","completion":"Based on the analysis of the given text and the sentiment associated with the words and phrases used, it can be inferred that the statement leans more toward a negative sentiment. Let's break down the statement into its constituent parts to gain a better understanding of the sentiment conveyed. 1. \\"Can explode obnoxiously\\": The term \\"explode\\" may convey a sense of sudden impact or change, but the addition of \\"obnoxiously\\" has a negative connotation, suggesting the change is unpleasant, irritating, or unwanted. Hence, this part can be considered negative. 2. \\"Into 2,500 screens\\": This part could be seen as neutral unless taken in the context of the entire sentence. The number of screens (2,500) suggests a large coverage or massive potential for exposure, but in the context of this statement, that exposure might be for something undeserving, based on the negative sentiment previously mentioned. Thus, it leans toward a negative connotation. 3. \\"While something of Bubba Ho-Tep's clearly evident quality\\": This part of the phrase conveys a kind of comparison to something deemed to have valuable or positive attributes. The use of \\"clearly evident quality\\" implies that there is an appreciation for the subject (Bubba Ho-Tep). This part can be considered positive. 4. \\"May end up languishing on a shelf somewhere\\": The last part shifts back to a negative tone. The use of \\"languishing\\" suggests that something with potential value or quality is being neglected, left unappreciated, and overlooked. The addition of \\"on a shelf somewhere\\" reinforces the idea of neglect and isolation. Taking all of these elements into account, the overall sentiment of this statement is negative. The tone conveys a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction, as it highlights the unfortunate scenario where something deemed unpleasant or undeserving receives ubiquity and attention, while something of evident quality remains obscure and unnoticed."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Did you know that even magical machines need some TLC (Tender Loving Care) once in a while? Just like you and your toys, they love being clean and shiny too. Today, we will learn how to make them very happy by following these three simple steps: unplug, wipe, and flush. Ready? Let's get cleaning! Step 1: Unplug the Machine First things first, we need to make sure the machine is safe to touch. Whenever we want to clean a magical machine, we should always remember to unplug it, or take it away from the power source. You might find a cord connecting it to the wall, or it could have batteries. Ask a grown-up to help you with this part, as they know how to do it safely. Step 2: Wipe Down the Outside Now that our machine is not connected to any power, it's time to make it sparkle and shine! Grab a soft cloth, like the ones we use to clean our hands and face. Dip the cloth in warm soapy water and wring it out, so it doesn’t get too wet and splashy. Gently clean the outside of the magical machine by wiping it all over. Be careful not to let any water get inside the machine - it doesn't like swimming! Step 3: Flush the Hose Attachment You might find a hose attached to your magical machine. It's like a long rubber snake! These hoses help the machine do its magic, so we need to keep them clean too. To do this, we're going to flush it, which means we'll run water through it to remove any dirt hiding inside. Ask a grown-up to help you with this part, as they can make sure the hose is safely disconnected from the machine. Hold one end of the hose over a sink or a bucket, while your grown-up helper carefully pours some water into the other end. Watch as the water flushes out any dirt from the hose! Conclusion: Congratulations, little helper! You did an amazing job cleaning the magical machine. Now it's happy, and it can keep doing its magic for a long time. Remember these three steps: unplug, wipe, and flush, and you'll be a great helper for all the magical machines in your life!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Wasn’t an easy thing to do, but the depression and sadness wasn’t fair to my 6 year old son. He needed his mummy who was always sad, in his mind. About 6 months later, I was having a scan. This time, I had a strong heart beat on screen. The pregnancy was extremely high risk, consultant led, daily injections, scans every 2 weeks from 18 weeks. No guarantees of a good outcome.

Tommy sets two pots of water, Pot A and Pot B, on the stove and sets each burner to a different temperature. Tommy is unable to see what the temperatures of the burners are though. He sits around patiently and waits until he notices that Pot B's water is beginning to vaporize, while Pot A's water is not vaporizing. Hint: Continued heating of the water after the ice has completely melted will now increase the kinetic energy of the liquid molecules and the temperature will rise. Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C. Answer:","completion":"The water in Pot B is hotter. Based on the information provided, we can infer that Pot B's water has reached its boiling point, which is 100°C under standard atmospheric pressure. This is because the water in Pot B has begun to vaporize, indicating that it has reached the temperature where water starts to turn into steam. The process of vaporization occurs when water molecules have absorbed enough heat to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold them together in the liquid state, allowing them to escape as vapor or gas. The fact that Pot A's water is not vaporizing suggests that its temperature has not yet reached the boiling point and is therefore lower than 100°C. In summary, since Pot B's water has reached the boiling point and begun to vaporize while Pot A's water has not, we can determine that the water in Pot B is hotter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A 14-year-old British student is packing for the next day of school: textbooks, notebooks, pens, 250 grams of flour, an egg and some cooking oil. Wait, what? It's not a joke. From September, cookery will be a compulsory course for kids aged 7-14 in the UK. Primary school students will learn how to put things together and make simple, healthy food. At high school, students will then master a number of different meals. They will also learn some cooking skills including baking. Britain is sometimes known as a country with bad food and unhealthy eating habits. These new courses are part of the country's effort to bring healthy food back onto the table. \\"One in four British families no longer has a table that everyone can eat around. One out of every two meals we eat is eaten alone. Only four out of ten of us enjoy eating meals with our children,\\" British writer Joanna Blythman wrote in her book Bad Food Britain: How A Nation Ruined Its Appetite in 2006. Instead, ready meals have become the first choice for many British kids, because their parents are often too busy to cook a proper meal. The Department for Education hopes that the cookery courses can introduce children to good food and reduce childhood _ . \\"It's important that children can develop an interest and understanding of good food,\\" said a spokesman for the department. \\"We want to encourage them to develop a love of food and cooking that will stay with them as they grow up.

Not just Jim: Baalke says he shares Harbaugh’s feelings for Kaepernick When the report surfaced late Sunday night that the 49ers were shopping quarterback Colin Kaepernick, it was, no doubt, a shocker. But impossible to believe? Not quite. Consider: Kaepernick is coming off a so-so season and has lost his biggest advocate in Jim Harbaugh, the coach who pushed to draft him, decided to start him and is probably still shouting his praises to strangers in Ann Arbor. On Wednesday, general manager Trent Baalke was asked about the notion that he’s not quite as smitten with Kaepernick as his former head coach. That is, Baalke’s made it clear the 49ers aren’t trading Kaepernick this offseason, but what about, say, in 2016, Trent? After all, have we ever heard Baalke bellow that Kaepernick is “great with a capital G,” or offer similar over-the-top hosannas? “The assumption that Kap was Jim’s guy? Kap was our guy,” Baalke said. “And I think Jim would say the same thing if you called Jim and asked him.” Baalke said Harbaugh “pushed hard” for the 49ers to trade up to draft Kaepernick in 2011 and they were in lockstep with the move. Like Harbaugh, he was a huge Kaepernick fan four years ago and he insisted his feelings haven’t changed. On Wednesday, Baalke was asked what he liked about Kaepernick. He suggested the question was outlandish: “Do I really have to answer that?” he said. The he answered: “There’s a lot of things I like about Kap. And there’s a lot of things this organization likes about Kap. It’s really - I don’t want to say a foolish question … The guy is talented football player. He can impact a game with his arm, with his feet and he’s done it a consistent level. We’ve won a lot of playoff games with him. We’ve won a lot of football games with him. And we look forward to winning a lot more with him. He is our quarterback.” After issuing a statement debunking the trade rumor Sunday night, Baalke offered a similarly forceful denial Wednesday. “There has not been a discussion with another team regarding Kap,” he said. “We have not made a call, nor has anyone called us. So the report that was pushed out there … was false. One-hundred percent false … There has been absolutely none. No conversations. With any team. Regarding our quarterback. Period. Exclamation point.” What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about a football player named Colin Kaepernick, who is a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. Some people thought that the 49ers might trade him to another team, but the general manager, Trent Baalke, said that they are not planning to trade him and he is still their quarterback. Baalke also talked about the things he likes about Kaepernick, such as his ability to impact the game with his arm and feet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the former prime minister who did not provide financial support for the leader of the Nimrod Expedition? from the following article ? Despite the public acclaim that had greeted Shackleton's achievements after the Nimrod Expedition in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir Harry Brittain—\\"a bit of a floating gent\\". By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, which had left Cardiff in July 1910, and on the concurrent Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rosebery.

One day, however, her agency's primary client, short-tempered Cyrus Baxter, happens to be seated beside her.

Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake.

As Iliescu took the stage, he acknowledged the difficulties the country has faced in recent years and the challenges it has had to overcome in order to maintain stability and progress. Recognizing the important role a steady leadership can play during such critical times, Iliescu has vowed to double down on his efforts to provide that consistent guiding hand, drawing upon his previous experiences in office. Having previously served as the president between 1990-1996 and 2000-2004, Iliescu possesses extensive political and administrative experience. He emphasized that his deep understanding of the political landscape, unique leadership skills, and proven track record, make him the best candidate to navigate the complex challenges Romania faces today. In his speech, Iliescu outlined the key principles he plans to prioritize if he is reelected. Firstly, he stated that stability - economic, political, and social - would be the cornerstone of his governance. This would mean working closely with the parliament, political parties, business leaders, and the Romanian people to create a supportive ecosystem that enables sustainable growth powered by both domestic industries and international investments. To create an environment of economic stability, Iliescu emphasized the importance of continued efforts to strengthen the private sector. He promised to implement policies that encourage entrepreneurship, create job opportunities, and attract foreign investments, while also providing social safety nets for vulnerable communities to minimize disparities and ensure inclusive growth. Iliescu also pledged to tackle corruption head-on by introducing strict regulations and robust institutional mechanisms that ensure transparency, accountability, and efficient distribution of resources. He acknowledged that corruption has been a long-standing problem in the country, and a strong push towards a corruption-free Romania would boost public trust in the national institutions and create a favorable environment for development. In terms of political stability, Iliescu promised to work collaboratively with all political factions, in order to foster unity and prevent any potential unrest. He underscored the importance of dialogue and consensus, and reiterated his commitment to involving various stakeholders, be it from different political parties, civil society, or the private sector, in the decision-making process. Furthermore, Iliescu touched upon the subject of Romania's role in the international arena, expressing his intent to maintain a strong relationship with both regional neighbors and major international players. This, he believes, would not only enhance the country's global standing but also ensure a stable foreign policy, which would contribute to the overall stability of the nation. Lastly, Iliescu emphasized that a successful Romania relies upon a strong foundation in education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. He vowed to allocate the necessary resources, both financial and human, to these key sectors, in an effort to create a well-equipped, healthy, and educated population that is capable of driving the country's progress. In summary, former President Ion Iliescu's renewed bid for the presidency aims to focus on delivering stability and progress to Romania. Drawing upon his vast experience and his proven track record, Iliescu has outlined a comprehensive roadmap for the country's development, based on economic growth, social inclusion, and political unity. If his pledges are to be realized, Romania is poised for a renewed era of stability and prosperity under Iliescu's careful guidance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"King Baggot and Jean-Pierre Melville were both filmmakers, but they were not both French. King Baggot (1879-1948) was an American actor, film director, and screenwriter. He began his acting career on stage in the late 19th century and transitioned to the film industry during the silent era. He directed over 50 films between 1911 and 1928, with a focus on silent films. Baggot is often considered one of the pioneering filmmakers of the early American cinema. Jean-Pierre Melville (1917-1973), on the other hand, was a French film director, screenwriter, and producer. He played a key role in shaping French cinema, particularly in the area of film noir and gangster movies. Melville's influential films include \\"Le Samouraï\\" (1967), \\"Le Cercle Rouge\\" (1970), and \\"Army of Shadows\\" (1969). His unique style and approach contributed to the development of the French New Wave and modern cinema as a whole.

Hypothesis: The two people are on the same bike. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the two people are on the same bike given the premise. The premise clearly states that there are two people, each riding separate bikes, involved in a bicycle race. They are both rounding a corner on this sunny day, which suggests that they are participating in the race independently, on their own bicycles. In order to further understand the reasoning behind this conclusion, let's break down the premise and hypothesis: Premise: 1. There are two people involved. 2. Each person is riding a separate bike. 3. They are both participating in a bicycle race. 4. They are rounding a corner. 5. The race is occurring on a sunny day. Based on these facts, we can deduce a mental picture where two people are engaged in a bicycle race, navigating through a course marked by corners, and doing so on a sunny day. Additionally, the fact that they are said to be riding \\"separate bikes\\" implies that there are two distinct bicycles, each being ridden by one person. Hypothesis: 1. The two people are on the same bike. This statement contradicts the initial premise. The hypothesis suggests that both persons are riding together on one bicycle. Given the information provided in the premise, this scenario is implausible. If we were to rephrase the hypothesis to align with the premise, it might look more like this: Revised Hypothesis: 1. The two people are competing against each other in a bicycle race. In this scenario, the revised hypothesis coincides with the facts provided in the premise. Both participants are actively involved in a bicycle race and are competing against each other while riding separate bikes.

The magazine is read both by model railroaders and those into logging history and modeling. The magazine ended publication in August 2008. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Tall Timber Short Lines is about trains\\"?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"Tall Timber Short Lines\\" is about trains, specifically focusing on logging railroads and short line railroads. The magazine combined the interests of model railroading enthusiasts and those who are passionate about logging history and modeling. These topics are intrinsically linked to trains, as both logging railroads and short line railroads involve railway systems that are used for transporting logs and other materials across shorter distances, typically within a specific region or industry. Logging railroads are specialized railway systems designed to transport timber and logs from forest areas to sawmills, processing facilities, or transportation hubs where the timber can be shipped for further distribution. These railroads were heavily relied upon during the peak of the logging industry, playing a crucial role in the expansion and development of commercial and residential areas across various countries, especially in North America. Short line railroads, on the other hand, are smaller railway operations that serve local industries and communities by connecting them to national rail networks. These railroads are owned and operated by smaller, regional companies and typically span shorter distances than mainline or Class I railroads. Short line railroads can serve multiple purposes, including accommodating the transport of logs, agricultural products, raw materials, and manufactured goods. The publication of \\"Tall Timber Short Lines\\" aimed to provide a specialized platform for those interested in the history, operations, and modeling of these two types of railroads. By delving into the intricacies, engineering, and innovations of logging and short line railroads, the magazine offered a comprehensive and engaging source of information for train enthusiasts and historians alike. Although \\"Tall Timber Short Lines\\" ended publication in August 2008, its legacy and influence on the train and model railroading community remain.

Q: The IFITM3 polymorphism rs12252-C, which encodes an IFITM3 isoform (D21 IFITM3) lacking 21 amino acids at the amino terminus, has been controversially associated with poor clinical outcomes in patients with H1N1 influenza A virus (IAV) infections. In vitro studies have shown that D21 IFITM3 loses its ability to restrict H1N1 IAV. Subsequent research has also revealed that tyrosine 20 is the key determinant for IFITM3 endocytic trafficking, which is essential for the efficient anti-viral activity of IFITM3. In contrast to previous studies, we demonstrated that both D21 IFITM3 and an IFITM3 variant (Y20A IFITM3), in which tyrosine 20 is substituted with alanine, strongly restricted entry mediated by IAV H1, H3, H5, and H7 proteins. D21 IFITM3 also efficiently suppressed replication of H1N1 and, to a lesser extent, H3N2 IAV. D21 IFITM3 and Y20A IFITM3 had broader subcellular distributions than full-length IFITM3 but an abundant amount of both IFITM3 variants still localized to late endosomes and lysosomes. Our data indicate that tyrosine 20 partially regulates the subcellular localization of IFITM3 but is not functionally essential for IFITM3-mediated IAV restriction. They also suggested that mechanisms, other than viral entry restriction, might contribute to variations in clinical outcomes of H1N1 influenza associated with rs12252-C.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose pressure in a volcano builds up quickly happens, how will it affect lava stays at a lower temperature. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you have presented involves the rapid buildup of pressure within a volcano, and you are curious about how this might affect lava remaining at lower temperatures and whether there might be a direct or indirect effect on the volcanic process. If pressure in a volcano builds up quickly, there are some potential effects on the lava and the overall process: 1. Rapid pressure increase, combined with lower temperature lava, could lead to an explosive eruption. As the pressure increases, gases dissolved in the magma (primarily water vapor and carbon dioxide) would come out of solution, expanding rapidly. If the lava remains at lower temperatures, it would be more viscous and resistant to flow. The rapid expansion of gases and the resistant nature of cooler lava could result in an explosive eruption, expelling ash, lava fragments, and volcanic bombs into the air, instead of a relatively calm effusive eruption with smooth lava flows. 2. Rapid pressure buildup in the volcano could cause the magma chamber to rupture the surrounding rock or force magma to find new paths to the surface. In these cases, there might be an increased likelihood of the formation of new fissures and vents, or even lateral blasts. Some of these events could be potentially catastrophic, such as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, where the lateral blast caused a massive avalanche and widespread destruction. 3. The lower temperature of lava might somewhat slow down the formation of new rock, as it takes longer to cool and solidify. This could affect the timeline for subsequent eruptions and the recovery of the volcano's surroundings, as well as the eventual composition and structure of the resulting igneous rocks. In conclusion, a rapid buildup of pressure in a volcano with lower temperature lava can have both direct and indirect effects on the volcanic process. An explosive eruption is more likely, potentially leading to more destructive and widespread effects; new fissures, vents, or lateral blasts may also occur. The lower temperature lava might slow down the formation of new rock, which could impact the volcano's future eruptions and geological processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following context: Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter. answer the following question: Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks?

Should you want to become one, a few requirements: Be willing to cast off your stuff and accumulate no more; have a flexible definition of what it means to be at home; master the Excel spreadsheet; accept, and even grudgingly appreciate, the ubiquity of Ikea. Debbie Campbell and her husband, Michael, who have embraced, if not promoted, what they refer to as the Senior Nomad way of life on their blog, might add another criterion: the willingness to uproot oneself at a stage in life when others are settling down in a recliner with the remote. “We were nearing the time to consider retiring,” said Ms. Campbell, 58, who until recently owned a graphic design business. “We both decided we had one more adventure in us.” That decision was made just over two years ago at the couple’s townhouse in Seattle. Their daughter Mary Campbell, visiting from her home in Paris, thought they should travel. A friend of her husband’s, she told them, had lived all over, including South America, where he rented apartments and worked remotely. “My thought was, ‘Had she looked in our bank account and seen more money than I thought we had?’ ” said Mr. Campbell, 69, a former sports marketing executive. But rather than staying in hotels, Mary suggested that her parents use Airbnb, the home rental site that has inspired devotion from many tourists and criticism from affordable housing advocates, the hotel industry and some city officials. The Campbells had never used Airbnb, but weren’t dissuaded by their lack of experience or the criticism. Sharing sites like Airbnb, Mr. Campbell said, “meet a real need in the marketplace.” His daughter’s suggestion planted the idea that he and his wife could wrap up their careers, downsize and reduce their living expenses, Mr. Campbell added. If they could afford to live in Seattle without working, could they also afford to live abroad, renting other people’s homes? After three months of Excel number crunching, they concluded that they could. So the sailboat on which the couple had spent so many weekends — sold. Ms. Campbell’s little Volkswagen convertible — someone else’s dream ride now. Their townhouse — occupied by renters. Everything else was stashed in a 12-by-15-foot storage unit. The Campbells have spent the past year and a half crisscrossing Europe, living for a week or more in one rental home before moving on to another. They’ve stayed in a grand formal apartment in Florence, a graphic designer’s funky place in Paris and a farmhouse in Wexford, Ireland. Their home in Luxembourg had beautiful exposed beams and a loft; their apartment in Tallinn, Estonia, had a sauna. And when they arrived in Rome, they found themselves in the unusual position of not knowing which street door their home was behind. “We’re not on vacation,” Mr. Campbell said. “We’re not retiring in the traditional sense. We’re out seeing the world in Airbnb apartments because that’s how we can afford to do it.” The Campbells were discussing their adventures last month while settling into their latest home on the road, a spacious riad in Marrakesh. They had flown south from Paris, their unofficial hub, in search of warmer weather, and were curious to see the apartment they had selected from hundreds of listings online, as they always are. “Most of the fun comes from opening the door and not knowing what’s on the other side,” Ms. Campbell said, adding that as the family cook, “I go straight to the kitchen.” In Morocco, the Campbells were struck by the local architectural style, the way their riad was furnished with long couches and low tables for people to sit and drink tea, and designed around a courtyard with an opening to the sky instead of windows to let in light. “Debbie and I just had dinner, and we were sitting at what looks like a dining room table, but if it rains, it’ll come right down on the table,” Mr. Campbell said. “Riad is not a word I was familiar with until six weeks ago.” The couple’s friends have expressed skepticism about staying in strangers’ homes glimpsed only online. What if they arrive in Berlin to a pigsty? Of the 46 apartments they’ve rented so far, there have been duds, Ms. Campbell said. And in those cases, “I take pretty scarves and tie them around lamps I don’t like.” But those have been rare, and the couple has developed a careful selection process. They use filters on the Airbnb site to find a handful of well-reviewed rentals in their destination city, looking for places around 90 a night, with Wi-Fi, an adequately stocked kitchen, a location in the town center and, ideally, outdoor space. They email the hosts and begin culling the list based on availability, past experience and gut reactions. “After 550 days, we’re getting pretty smart about what we like,” Mr. Campbell said. They are also noticing cultural differences about how people live. For instance, the austerity of Scandinavian apartments. Or the way homes in southern Spain tend to be dark, with windows shut to the blistering sun. In Helsinki, Ms. Campbell said, “every house had a big boot scraper on the doorstep, so you knew bad things happen there in the winter.” The universal design language, at least with Airbnb rentals, is Ikea. “I have washed more Ikea plates than any human on earth,” Mr. Campbell said with a laugh. “People must get a checklist from somebody and go to Ikea.” The Senior Nomads have their own checklist, little rituals to lessen the feeling that they are camping in a stranger’s home. After arriving, Ms. Campbell heads straight for a market; cooking at home saves money and gives the couple a chance to try local foods. And after chatting via FaceTime with Mary Campbell or another of their four children, they watch a podcast of “NBC Nightly News,” delayed by one day. “We’ll wake up tomorrow, have our cereal and orange juice — that makes us feel at home,” Mr. Campbell said. “And because of the Internet and Wi-Fi, you instantly feel reconnected.” At night, the couple break out one of the few comforts from their Seattle home that wasn’t sold or put in storage. “Whenever I see people travel with pillows I think, really?” Ms. Campbell said. “But no matter what bed we land on, we have our down pillows.” Beyond that, she added, they don’t find themselves longing for anything from their old life. (Well, some things they do long for. Ms. Campbell recently confessed on the couple’s blog to having a cry over the lack of a vegetable peeler in their rental in Naples, Italy, an outburst, she said, caused by always taking inventory of new kitchens and finding them lacking.) Mary Campbell, 32, a food stylist in Paris, has acted as a Sherpa of sorts to her parents, guiding them through European public transport and the visa process, and occasionally joining them on the road. Her parents’ views about home and lifestyle have changed, she has noticed. “Now, over a year into it, they’re much more comfortable in a smaller space,” she said. “They don’t have a car over here. The walking lifestyle has been a discovery for them. They’ve redefined what they thought they needed.” She added: “It’s so adventuresome and so different from anything else I hear that my friends’ parents are doing.” Patrice Fiset, the friend of Mary Campbell’s husband whose rootless existence inspired her parents, said he follows the Campbells’ blog and is similarly impressed. He joked that his own parents’ retirement as Florida snowbirds pales in comparison. “In a way, I wish they were like Debbie and Michael,” Mr. Fiset said. “Because then I’d be visiting them in Morocco.” Last July, the Campbells returned to Seattle to visit friends and attend a son’s wedding. But it wasn’t a homecoming, exactly. They stayed in an Airbnb apartment in a different neighborhood and renewed the agreement with their tenants for another year. “We drove by our house, and I didn’t say, ‘I really wish we lived there,’ ” Ms. Campbell said. And when they flew back to Europe this time, she added, the Senior Nomads did something different. “We bought one-way tickets,” Ms. Campbell said, laughing. Mr. Campbell chimed in after his wife, and there was almost a sense of giddiness in his voice: “We don’t know when we’re going back.” An earlier version of a picture caption in the slide show with this article misidentified the location at which Mr. Campbell was photographed. It is Granada, not Seville. A version of this article appears in print on February 26, 2015, on page D1 of the New York edition with the headline: A Grand Tour With 46 Oases.

As they were considering retirement, they chose to embrace an unconventional lifestyle and start an adventure by traveling the world while renting different homes via Airbnb. The Campbells sold most of their belongings, including their house, which they leased out, and started their journey. They traveled across Europe, from Florence to Paris to Wexford, Ireland, living in different homes, from grand formal apartments to farmhouses. Their travel routine involves selecting carefully reviewed properties on Airbnb, communicating with hosts, and maintaining a budget of about 90 per night for each property. Preferences include Wi-Fi access, a well-equipped kitchen, central town location, and if possible, outdoor space. After finalizing a place, they follow set rituals to make themselves at home like grocery shopping and connecting with family back home via FaceTime. Interestingly, they found cultural variations evident in local residences throughout their journey, like the austerity of Scandinavian homes or the sun-protected darkness of homes in southern Spain. Despite these variations, they observed the common presence of Ikea items, joking that they've probably cleaned more Ikea plates than anyone on earth. They also carry their down pillows from home, providing a touch of familiarity wherever they stay. Motivated by their adventurous spirit and desire for exploration, the Campbells have redefined their understanding of what they need in life. Despite occasional hardships and minor inconveniences, they don't regret their decision.

Jessica Jerreat. Binge drinking is becoming a deadly problem in the U.S. with New Mexico and Alaska topping the chart for the most alcohol-related deaths. A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that several mountain-region states have a higher than average number of deaths. Figures showed that about 88,000 Americans died from drink-related causes each year, and that about 70 percent of those deaths were of working age adults. Maps of the U.S. above and below show the extent of binge drinking in individual states in 2010. Health researchers compiled information on alcohol-related deaths - from violence and car crashes to heart disease - that took place between 2006 and 2010. New Mexico 16.4 percent. Alaska 15.9 percent. Colorado 14.2 percent. Wyoming 13.4 percent. Arizona 13.4 percent. Montana 13.2 percent. California 12.3 percent. Nevada 11.6 percent. Oregon 11.6 percent. Idaho 11.3 percent. Figures from CDC. What they found was that while the national average was one in 10 deaths that could be attributed to alcohol, states including New Mexico had far higher figures. They found that excessive drinking was the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the U.S., and that young men were the group most likely to meet an untimely death because of drinking. 'Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of preventable death that kills many Americans in the prime of their lives,' Ursula Bauer, of the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, said. 'We need to redouble our efforts to implement scientifically proven public health approaches to reduce this tragic loss of life and the huge economic costs that result.' The study looked at how binge drinking could be attributed to deaths caused by everything from liver disease and cancer to car crashes. The study counted binge drinking as more than four drinks a day for women and five for men. After New Mexico, with 16.4 percent rate, states with the highest alcohol-related deaths in the 20-64 age group were Alaska, with 15.9 percent, Colorado with 14.2 percent, and Wyoming with 13.4 percent. Alcoholic liver disease 14,364. Liver cirrhosis 7,847. Homicide 7,756. Vehicle crashes 12,460. Poison (non alcholol) 8,404. Suicide 8,179. Fall injuries 7,541. Alcohol dependence syndrome 3,728. Alcohol abuse 2,022. Alcohol poisoning 1,647. Figures from CDC. The highest causes of deaths among all age groups including liver disease - attributed to 14,364 deaths, as well as car crashes, which accounted for 12,460 deaths, and murders, at 7,756. Authors of the study, which was published in Preventing Chronic Disease, also accounted for fetal alcohol syndrome and child abuse. 'Excessive alcohol use is a huge public. health problem. It's killing people in the prime of their lives,' Dr Robert Brewer, of the CDC Alcohol Program, told the Huffington Post. The study suggested that those who had died from alcohol-related reasons had on average lost 30 years of life. The largest age group affected was aged from 20 to 64. A map of the U.S. that illustrates the findings showed that a line of states stretching from Montana to Arizona had above average deaths. Health researchers say consumers need to be more aware of what constitutes 'one drink' On the other end of the scale, Maryland residents appeared to have the healthiest attitude to drinking, with only 7.5 percent of deaths attributable to alcohol. The study looked at 54 causes of death that could be attributed to drinking, including alcohol poisoning, liver disease, accidents, and breast cancer. Researchers also looked at the impact of excessive drinking - more than eight drinks a week for a woman and 15 for a man - and how that affected chronic disease. An estimated 38 million Americans drink more than the recommended weekly limit, leading other health researchers to believe that the CDC findings could be lower than the reality. Dr David Crabb, of the Indiana Alcohol. Research Center, told the Huffington Post: 'A lot of the injury isn't just the people you consider alcohol abusers, but a much a larger group that binge drink or consume higher levels than recommended.'

Kurtis Eugene Warner (born June 22, 1971) is a former American football quarterback. He played for three National Football League (NFL) teams: the St. Louis Rams, the New York Giants, and the Arizona Cardinals. He was originally signed by the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 1994 after playing college football at Northern Iowa. Warner went on to be considered the best undrafted NFL player of all time, following a 12-year career regarded as one of the greatest stories in NFL history. Warner announced his desire to return to the Cardinals for the 2009 season. The Cardinals offered him a two-year contract worth around 20 million but Warner was looking for a contract that would pay him about 14 million a year and the two sides could not come to an agreement. On February 27, 2009 Warner became a free agent and went on to have talks with the San Francisco 49ers. The 49ers offered Warner a contract worth more than that offered by the Cardinals. On March 4, Warner re-signed with the Cardinals to a two-year deal worth 23 million total, 4 million for each of the next two years, with a 15 million signing bonus, and 19 million guaranteed. Warner underwent arthroscopic hip surgery to repair a torn labrum on March 17, 2009. On September 20, 2009, Warner broke the NFL's single-game record for completion percentage in the regular season, completing 24 of 26 passing for 243 yards and two touchdowns. Warner's 92.3 percent completion rate broke the previous NFL record set by Vinny Testaverde in 1993. On November 1, 2009, Warner threw a career-high-equaling five interceptions during a loss to the Carolina Panthers. During the same game Warner became the first quarterback in the NFL to throw for over 14,000 yards with two different teams. On November 8, Warner equaled his career-high of five touchdown passes in a single game during a 41-21 victory over the Chicago Bears. This performance led to Warner being named both the NFC Offensive Player of the Week and the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Week. On November 15, 2009, Warner reached a career milestone with his 200th touchdown pass during a 31-20 win against the Seattle Seahawks. On November 22, 2009, during a 21-13 victory over the St. Louis Rams, Warner left the game after suffering a concussion. Warner continued to suffer from post-concussion symptoms and on November 29, 2009, he was deactivated against the Tennessee Titans, breaking his consecutive starts streak at 41 straight games. On December 6, 2009, Warner returned to action as the Cardinals defeated the Minnesota Vikings 30-17. Warner registered his fourth consecutive game with a passer rating of 120 or better, making him only the second quarterback in NFL history to accomplish the feat. After his three-touchdown performance, Warner was named both the NFC Offensive Player of the Week and the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Week. On December 27, 2009, Warner became only the second quarterback in NFL history to throw 100 touchdown passes with two different teams (Hall of Famer Fran Tarkenton is the other), in the Cardinals' 31-10 win over the St. Louis Rams. On December 29, 2009, Warner was named an alternate quarterback for the NFC team in the 2010 Pro Bowl.

An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction.

The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Write an article based on this summary: – You may be tempted to stay up to check out all the new late-night TV hosts, but make sure you've got your orange glasses on first. Various studies and expert opinion suggest that special filters, light bulbs, and the aforementioned orange-tinted eyewear can help block melatonin-disrupting blue light emitted by electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computer screens, the New York Times reports. Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone tied to sleep onset, and blue light has been shown in some studies to suppress its production. The most recent research comes out of a Swiss study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, in which 13 teen boys were outfitted in these glasses, known as blue blockers, during the evening while they used devices with LED screens. The result, per the Times: The boys experienced \\"significantly more\\" sleepiness with the orange-tinted glasses than when they were sporting clear ones. A 2009 study of 20 adults came to similar conclusions, showing that subjects who wore amber-tinted eyeglasses enjoyed better sleep than those in yellow-tinted glasses (blocking UV light only). Orange shades aren't the only solution being bandied about: Bulbs that emit less blue light, filters to cover devices, and apps that change devices' blue-light emissions are also available, per the Times. Or, one could simply cut down on the gadgets once night comes. While experts tell the paper that being exposed to blue light is preferable during the day, it makes sense in the evening to block whatever blue light you can, either via smaller LED screens, dimmer light, or a cutdown on usage. \\"If you can look at the iPhone for 10 minutes rather than three hours, that makes a lot of difference,\\" a neuroendocrinology professor tells the Times. (Thank these three for inventing blue light.) Article:","completion":"Hey kids! Do you like watching shows and playing games on your phone, tablet, or computer at night? It's fun, but it can make it hard to sleep. And when you're sleepy, it's tough to play with your friends or think of the answers in school. So, let me tell you about a cool thing that can help you sleep better, called \\"orange glasses\\". You know how your phone or tablet has a bright light? That light has some blue in it, and blue light can make it harder for you to fall asleep. There's a special thing inside your body called melatonin, and it helps you get sleepy when it's time for bed. But the blue light from screens can stop melatonin from working well. Some scientists in Switzerland did an experiment to see how orange glasses can help. They asked 13 teenage boys to wear these glasses while using their phones or tablets at night. The orange glasses block the blue light, and guess what happened? The boys felt sleepier and had an easier time falling asleep than if they wore clear glasses or no glasses at all. People have also tried using different colored light bulbs or apps to make screens less blue at night. Another idea is to spend less time looking at screens before you go to bed. A wise teacher said that if you can look at your phone for 10 minutes instead of three hours before bedtime, that will be much better for your sleep.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Alexandros Othonaios ( Greek : , Gytheio , 1879 - Athens , 20 September 1970 ) was a distinguished Greek general , who became briefly Prime Minister of Greece , heading an emergency government during an abortive coup in 1933 . - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - The Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic (\\"Prothypourgós tis Ellinikís Dimokratías\\"), colloquially referred to as the Prime Minister of Greece (\\"Prothypourgós tis Elládas\\"), is the head of government of the Hellenic Republic and the leader of the Greek cabinet. The incumbent prime minister is Alexis Tsipras, who took office on 21 September 2015. - Alexis Tsipras (; born 28 July 1974) is the 185th and current Prime Minister of Greece, having been sworn in on 21 September 2015. He previously served as the 183rd Prime Minister of Greece from 26 January 2015 to 27 August 2015. Tsipras has been leader of the left-wing Greek political party Syriza since 4 October 2009. - Sparta (Doric Greek: ; Attic Greek: ) was a prominent city-state in ancient Greece. In antiquity the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. - East Mani (- \\"Anatolikí Máni\\") is a municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Its seat of administration is the town Gytheio (before 2011 the small town Kotronas). The municipality is located in the eastern part of the Mani Peninsula. It is a mountainous and rocky area. Its economy relies on fishing, olive oil and tourism. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation. - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf. - Gytheio, the ancient Gythium or Gytheion, is a town and a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality East Mani, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 197.313 km. It was the seaport of Sparta, some north. Gytheio used to be an important port until it was destroyed in 4th century AD, possibly by an earthquake. Today it is the largest and most important town in Mani. It is also the seat of the municipality of East Mani. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At the same time the Arts Council was contemplating a cut in the number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By...

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: How does Jessica feel about dating Helen? Title: Kissing Jessica Stein Movie plot: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother...

To","completion":"To this day, Logan couldn't understand Jeffrey's dislike of chocolate. To Logan, chocolate was a delicious, indulgent, and versatile treat that could elevate one's mood and satisfy the deepest of cravings. Its rich, creamy texture and its ability to melt in the mouth made it a comfort food for many, offering solace during sad times and a treat for special occasions. For Logan, this passion for chocolate manifested in many ways: savoring a luxurious truffle during a well-deserved break, treating friends to decadent chocolate desserts at gatherings, or rewarding oneself with a simple bar at the end of a long day. The wide variety of flavors and ways in which chocolate can be consumed made it even more alluring - from white to dark chocolate, mint to orange, and of course, the classic milk chocolate. On the contrary, Jeffrey's aversion perplexed Logan entirely. It was a well-known fact that the appreciation of chocolate was virtually universal, transcending borders, ages, and even dietary preferences. Its rich history, dating back thousands of years to the ancient Mesoamerican societies that prized it as a luxurious and highly-valued commodity, seemed to justify its present-day status as a beloved treat. Moreover, contemporary scientific research has demonstrated the health benefits of moderate chocolate consumption, particularly its antioxidant properties and ability to improve cardiovascular health. Nonetheless, Jeffrey remained impervious to these charms, whether it was an inexplicable incompatibility with his taste buds or an incident rooted in his past. Perhaps Jeffrey had a negative experience involving chocolate - an unfortunate stomach illness or even an embarrassing accident - that left a lasting impact on his aversion. Another possibility is that Jeffrey was one of the few who genuinely didn't enjoy the taste or texture of chocolate, associating its sweetness with a sense of heaviness, cloyingness, or even the dreaded concept of overindulgence. It could also be the case that Jeffrey's dislike of chocolate was used as a form of self-identity, setting him apart from most people who swoon over the beloved confection. He may have been seeking a sense of individuality, even going against the grain to establish his uniqueness. After all, people often take pride in a particular quirk or preference that sets them apart from the mainstream. Lastly, Jeffrey could have developed a dietary or ethical stance against chocolate consumption. With growing concerns over exploitation in the chocolate industry, many people choose to abstain from it altogether on moral grounds. In some cases, it becomes a symbol of their commitment to a more equitable and fair trade economy. In any case, Logan remained confounded by Jeffrey's dislike of chocolate, unable to fathom how one could resist its decadent allure or dismiss the joy that it brought to so many. But in the end, Logan accepted that, like with many tastes and preferences, chocolate had its share of devotees and dissenters. For Logan, it was just another reminder that there is always a myriad of flavors out there, and that it takes a diverse palette to truly savor the richness of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: It is getting hard to count how many times Miley Cyrus has stripped down for photo shoots — but the 22-year-old’s latest spread is her most provocative yet. Cyrus covers this month’s issue of Candy magazine, the first magazine “completely dedicated to celebrating tranvestism, transexuality, crossdressing and androgyny in all their glory.” In a series of photos taken by renowned celebrity photographer (and alleged sex predator) Terry Richardson, Cyrus playfully fellates a nightstick while donning a policeman’s cap, stretches out her tongue to lick her armpit hair and bends at the waist to reach for a sex toy. “Miley has what it takes,” the caption on each shot reads. Check out the complete unblurred photo shoot here (Warning: Photos are extremely NSFW). This isn’t the first time Cyrus has gotten naked for Richardson; the controversial photographer shot a younger Cyrus in his New York studio in 2013. The pair also worked together on Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” music video. Richardson, who’s worked with countless celebrities on sexy photo shoots, has become something of an outcast in the photography world in recent years. Last year, a model named Emma Appleton accused the photographer of soliciting sex from her in exchange for securing her a Vogue photo shoot. In December 2013, Richardson’s ex-girlfriend, Audrey Gelman, said that both she and Lena Dunham, who had been photographed by Richardson, “have regrets.” Last year, Vogue told Us Weekly it had “no plans to work with” its controversial former contributor in the future. ||||| “Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman.” That’s how Amy Schumer described her nude photo by Annie Leibovitz for the new Pirelli Calendar, seizing the words from the tweets and thinkpieces by her critics and cheerleaders, all of whom will reliably bicker over the headline-making photo shoot from the star, who has turned the unapologetic, self-deprecating embracing of her body image into a zeitgeist-seizing art form. In the photo, Schumer is nude with nothing but a pair of underwear and some heels on, her arms opting to conceal her nipples instead of the rolls on her stomach as she slouches, and holding a coffee cup as the flash of a bulb startles her face startles into a candid, quite beautiful pose. The Trainwreck and Inside Amy Schumer star is a model for photographer Annie Leibovitz’s “quite different” 43rd edition of the Pirelli Calendar, typically known for classic pin-up poses from the world’s most glamorous and flawless sex symbols—Naomi Campbell, Penelope Cruz, Kate Moss, Cindy Crawford—but which this year features some of the world’s most distinguished women, all noted for things other than, but also including, their looks. “The goal was to be very straightforward,” Leibovitz said in a press conference unveiling the images. “I wanted the pictures to show the women exactly as they are, with no pretense.” In addition to Schumer, other models for the calendar include names not classically associated with the phrase “pin-up”—Selma director Ava DuVernay; Yao Chen, the first Chinese goodwill ambassador for United Nations High Commission for Refugees; tennis phenom Serena Williams—and therefore reappropriates the phrase to encompass new layers of sexiness and beauty: the kind that triumphs confidence, intelligence, class, and strength as part of the idea of exhibitionism. The remainder of the calendar’s models include Lucasfilm producer Kathleen Kennedy, Yoko Ono, writer Fran Lebowitz, executive Mellody Hobson, former supermodel Natalia Vodianova, philanthropist Agnes Gund, blogger Tavi Gevinson, and Iranian artist Shirin Neshat. As for her own image, which bucks the celebrity tradition of airbrushing out curves and rolls, Schumer says, “I never felt more beautiful.” The more radical message she's sending: We’re all our fiercest champions, but we're also our biggest critics. That tension? That is natural. That is beautiful. It’s easy to sound trite or maybe even patronizing when praising a famous person for embracing their body, and for being candid about all the insecurities they still acknowledge. But to deny the power not just in Schumer’s involvement in this calendar but also in the way she has shared the photo would be an injustice to the effect it will undeniably have. “Beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless, woman,” she captioned the photo when she posted it on Twitter and on Instagram Monday morning. These are words that seem in contradiction with each other, almost like an insufferable beat poet who thinks she is being deeper than she is. But they’re not. Schumer is redirecting the body-positive movement in a more realistic, and maybe even emotionally healthier way. Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason. You can feel confident and proud of your body. You can find your curves sexy. You can embrace what some might call an imperfection. And you can also hate your body sometimes, too. Because to have a relationship with your body and your self-confidence means being honest about insecurities and your feelings about them. Otherwise you’re just projecting a false pride, convincing yourself that you’ve accepted parts of your body that you don’t like merely because a body-positive movement says you will be happier if you do. Schumer has always been candid about her body image, partly because she recognizes the radical power of being a successful and sexual woman in Hollywood while not having the body type of a waifish clothing rack with cartoon boobs. With great power comes great responsibility, and if not necessarily considering it a responsibility to discuss her body image struggles (because, dear God, how awful), she considers it an opportunity, and one that she’s relished. But she’s also been candid because we’ve forced her to. How many interviews has Schumer sat through, forced to answer questions about being a “trailblazer” because she’s carved a place for herself in show business without being a size zero? The brilliant comedian that she is, she’s used it as part of her comedy, especially in an often repeated bit about how in L.A. her arms register as legs. (It’s a good bit, even if we’ve heard her perform it so often by this point we could recite it ourselves.) The eloquent human that she is—the one who has been so incomparably gifted at channeling our own frustrations and complicated feelings with a razor-sharp wit laced with surprising shocks of emotion—she’s also used this candor to be more authentic than most celebrities have ever been about what it’s been like to be insecure with your body while under the scrutinizing gaze of the public eye. And then eventually conquer that. “Some nights I just didn’t even want to go on stage because I couldn’t find an outfit I looked good in,” she said on the Today show last month. Then, tearfully, “It’s been a struggle for me my whole life, especially just being in the entertainment industry, standing on a stage in front of people. I can’t perform my best or be confident if I’m not sure if I’m pulling at something. Sometimes I would just want to throw in the towel and say, ‘I’m not going to do stand-up tonight.’” We don’t often let our strong role models to have chink in their armor, especially ones that betray any sort of emotion or vulnerability. Amy Schumer, role model for all confident women, called bullshit on that, and we’re all better for it. So it’s with a careful honed grace, sharpened from so much of that, that Schumer shares the photo with the perfect message, a collection of words that some will use to describe how she looks, that she will use to describe her looks as her relationship to the photo and her body evolves (like all of us do with our own), and that actually mean something real—more real than any rote “This is beautiful!” plastic endorsement. Perhaps unintentionally, there’s a bit of cheeky poeticism to this photo being included as part of the Pirelli Calendar, which is routinely associated with “pin-up” poses. In an episode of Inside Amy Schumer that spoofed 12 Angry Men, jurors did not debate whether the defendant (played by Schumer) was guilty of committing murder, but instead the crime of not being hot enough to be on TV. At one point, one of the jurors bemoans the end of the days where only women as sexy and perfect as Marilyn Monroe—the iconic pin-up girl—were allowed on TV. Monroe was a size 8, another juror points out. Schumer is a size 6. A beautiful, gross, strong, thin, fat, pretty, ugly, sexy, disgusting, flawless size 6. ||||| Annie Leibovitz opts for natural and effortless style in portraits of Serena Williams, Yoko Ono, Amy Schumer and others Pirelli calendar goes with less steam and more jokes for 2016 The annual calendar produced by Pirelli tyres – which traditionally centres on the artfully lit nude bodies of female supermodels – has been unveiled, presenting a dramatic shift in subject matter and aesthetic. Gone are the gym-toned limbs and heaving bosoms; in their place for the 2016 calendar, shot by Annie Leibovitz, are simple portraits of women of various sizes, ages and ethnicities chosen for their “professional, social, cultural, sporting and artistic accomplishment”. Quick guide A brief history of the Pirelli calendar Show Hide What is it? The Pirelli calendar was first published in 1963 as a corporate gift for clients and customers of the Italian tyre company. The annual publication of the calendar – which has traditionally featured conventionally sexy images of nude women – has become an unlikely fixture on the fashion calendar because it attracts big-name photographers, models and celebrities. Its blatant objectification of naked women has been controversial and at times obtuse, but the calendar has survived by becoming more diverse and inclusive in its approach and its subject matter. Who has shot for it? ​The original photographer was Terence Donovan, who was tasked with producing an arty, tasteful reimagining of the traditional car mechanics' workshop pin-up calendar. ​He returned in 1987. Other notable names include Brian Duffy (1965), Sarah Moon (1972), Norman Parkinson (1985), Bert Stern (1986), Richard Avedon (1995, 1997), Peter Lindbergh (1996, 2002, 2014, 2017), Annie Leibowitz (2000, 2016), Mario Testino (2001), Terry Richardson (2010), Steve McCurry (2013), Helmut Newton (2014), Steven Meisel (2015) and Tim Walker (2018). What about the models? The models have often taken second billing to the photographers, although there have been plenty of big names. Naomi Campbell featured in 1987, and the calendar tapped into the cult of the supermodel from 1994 when Herb Ritts shot Helena Christensen, Cindy Crawford, Karen Alexander and Kate Moss. Steven Meisel's 2015 edition was a who's who of the biggest names in modelling including Gigi Hadid, Karen Elson and Joan Smalls. How has the calendar moved with the times? In 2007, Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin took inspiration from Hollywood by featuring Penélope Cruz, Lou Doillon, Hilary Swank, Naomi Watts and a 71 year-old Sophia Loren. Peter Beard's 2009 calendar highlighted social activism. It was shot in Rio de Janeiro, using a mix of models and city residents – all clothed – who had started their own charities. Annie Leibowitz's 2016 calendar featured women who have achieved something significant in their fields, including Yoko Ono, Patti Smith, Serena Williams and Amy Schumer. Tim Walker's Alice in Wonderland calendar for 2018, styled by Vogue editor Edward Enninful, was the first to star an all-black cast, including Whoopi Goldberg, Puff Daddy, Naomi Campbell and RuPaul. Subjects include Yoko Ono, wearing a top hat, tuxedo jacket and fishnet tights; and Patti Smith, modelling jeans, boots and a snarl. The cultural commentator Fran Lebowitz makes an unlikely Miss May, smoking a cigarette in a man’s oversized pinstriped jacket. The blogger Tavi Gevinson, Chinese actor Yao Chen, artist Shirin Neshat, investment banker Mellody Hobson, the director of the film Selma, Ava DuVernay, and Agnes Gund, an art collector, also appear.

Photograph: Annie Leibovitz/Pirelli The tennis star Serena Williams was one of just two scantily clad stars, posing in a balletic lunge with her muscular, naked back to the camera. December’s subject, the comedian Amy Schumer, sips from a lipstick-stained takeaway coffee cup in her underwear, with soft rolls of flesh visible on her stomach. At the launch of the calendar on Monday, Leibovitz explained that none of these photographs had been conceived with the male gaze in mind. Williams’s photo was “not a nude but a body study”, she said, while Schumer’s was a comic conceit: “The idea was that she was the only one who had not got the memo about wearing clothes.” To the uninitiated, the Pirelli calendar might sound like a tatty document destined for mechanics to stare at in a garage. But during its 50-odd years of production, Pirelli has worked hard to cultivate a sense of artiness and exclusivity around the images. In its hard copy form the calendar is only sent out to a select and secret few, although the images circulate widely on the internet. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Annie Leibovitz attends the Pirelli calendar launch in London. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA They are given a veneer of respectability, and fashion industry approval, thanks to the inclusion of the world’s top supermodels and actors – Kate Moss, Gisele Bundchen and Julianne Moore to name a few – who are photographed by illustrious names including Herb Ritts, Richard Avedon and Helmut Newton. Monday’s slick launch event, in the grand ballroom of the Grosvenor House on Park Lane, London, underlined the seriousness with which Pirelli takes the calendar as a marketing exercise. The world’s media gathered for the unveiling of the images, listening as Clare Balding interviewed Leibovitz and three of the calendar’s subjects – Gevinson, Gund and Chen – on stage, while the proceedings were translated via headsets into four languages. The women spoke warmly of the calendar’s symbolism, with Leibovitz describing it as representative of a shift in the way women are viewed. The tyre manufacturer’s chief executive, Marco Tronchetti Provera, said the company had been looking to make a departure from the usual format of its calendar this year, one that felt “very timely”. “Women who have done something outstanding in their lives, from every corner of the world. This represents what Pirelli thinks is beautiful,” said Tronchetti Provera. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Yao Chen, the Chinese actor, in the calendar. Photograph: Annie Leibovitz/Pirelli Leibovitz added that the images were designed to look as natural and effortless as possible, with little “pretence” to the pictures. Though shot in flattering black and white, they had been subject to just a “little cleaning up” of the images rather than the usual heavy post-production work, she said. Though Leibovitz, who also photographed a calendar of nudes for Pirelli in 2000, declined to describe the calendar as a feminist watershed moment for the brand, she said: “Pirelli has always given free rein to the photographer, so it’s really about choice of photographer. I think the company has wanted to shift for a few years and my mandate was that they wanted to see some change.” During a behind-the-scenes film shown at the launch, the photographer’s almost-namesake Lebowitz offered a slightly different analysis: “Perhaps clothed women are going to have a moment.” ||||| Annie Leibovitz/Pirelli For more than half a century, Italian tire-maker Pirelli has released an annual calendar full of photos of supermodels in pin-up poses wearing skimpy lingerie or nothing at all. This year’s iteration marks a drastic departure from the form: The calendar’s models are luminaries of art, business, sports, and philanthropy, photographed by Annie Leibovitz. Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer. In fact, the only two women who appear in partial nudity are Amy Schumer and Serena Williams, who’ve each been targeted by body-shamers over the past year. Their gorgeous images do more to turn that shame around on their trolls than any Instagram comment war ever could. Advertisement Yoko Ono, Ava DuVernay, Iranian artist Shirin Neshat, Patti Smith, author Fran Lebowitz, actress Yao Chen, and Tavi Gevinson show up in the calendar, too. “I wanted the pictures to show the women exactly as they are, with no pretense,” Leibovitz told Vogue of the studio portraits. The calendar isn’t for sale; as in past years, it’ll be gifted to 20,000 “VIPs, musicians, politicians, and royalty.” The nudity of Williams and Schumer stands in stark contrast to Pirelli’s usual M.O. Previous decades have seen the world’s top professional beauties showcasing individual exposed, oiled-up body parts—with their faces, at times, cropped out—in what amounted to a fancified soft-core porn magazine. Last year’s featured women, which included lingerie models Adriana Lima, Joan Smalls, and Gigi Hadid, were shot swaddled in latex straddling bike seats and bathing in bubbles. Flip through the past 50 years of calendars and you’ll find just a few years of clothed women in editorial-type shoots. Taken as a whole, the archive testifies to the longtime persistence of one particular beauty ideal in fashion and mainstream media, one that can rarely accommodate a roll of fat, bulge of muscle, or pinch of age-spotted skin. Annie Leibovitz/Pirelli Now, Pirelli seems to realize, the world has gotten bored of this tired tradition. “A white, able-bodied cis-gendered woman being naked is just not revolutionary anymore,” Gevinson told the New York Times. “I don’t think anyone is going to be like, ‘Damn, I wanted those naked chicks.’ ” The calendar’s two naked chicks, Williams and Schumer, are the perfect step away from Pirelli’s nudity of yore. In any state of dress or undress, Schumer and Williams have been scrutinized for their looks, and both have resisted pressure to retreat into more modest clothing or a different strength-training regimen. Schumer has parodied her trolls’ ridiculous fixation on her looks and doubled down on her overtly sexual image. Williams, whose “large biceps” and “mold-breaking muscular frame” have been pondered over nearly as much as her athletic prowess, has batted down claims that her body shape makes her less feminine. (“First of all she’s a woman, and she wants to be a woman,” coach Tomasz Wiktorowski has said of his strategy to keep tennis player Agnieszka Radwanska small and lean.) In a Good Morning America interview, Williams praised her own body’s athletic form. “I love that I am a full woman and I’m strong and I’m powerful and I’m beautiful at the same time,” she said. |||||","completion":"Pirelli has unveiled the 43rd edition of its highly sought-after calendar, typically featuring semi-nude female models in cover-girl poses. This year, Pirelli has introduced a radical departure for the 2016 calendar, using portraits of 13 women of all ages known for their professional, social, cultural and sporting accomplishments. The calendar exhibits entrepreneur Mellody Hobson alongside 80-year-old art collector Agnes Gund, Chinese actor Yao Chen, Iranian visual artist Shirin Neshat, and French model and soundtrack composer Carla Bruni. Tennis player Serena Williams is featured alongside comedian, actor and filmmaker Amy Schumer who said she “never felt more beautiful”. Shot by world-renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz, the women are photographed not as subjects of desire, but as individuals who have succeeded in making their own mark on the world; reaching the heights of public esteem for which Pirelli’s clientele, or those of any other company for that matter, could only ever dream. Leibovitz said she was looking for a strong departure from the past, stating, “not many people know the calendar is aligned with corporate strategy, and this year the company's strategy was more aimed at women”."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Blood Feast Context: In the midst of a series of gruesome murders, a young woman is killed inside her suburban Miami house by a grey-haired, wild-eyed man. He stabs her in the eye and hacks her leg off with a machete, bagging the leg before he leaves. At the police station the next day, detective Pete Thornton investigates the killing, noting that it is the latest in a series of four murders by a homicidal maniac who has yet to leave any clues. The police chief advises him to continue to pursue the case. At Fuad Ramses Catering store, wealthy socialite Dorothy Fremont arrives, where she arranges for Fuad to cater a party for her daughter Suzette. Fuad agrees and tells Mrs. Fremont that the Egyptian feast that he is preparing has not been served for over 5,000 years. Mrs. Fremont wants the catering done in two weeks, and Fuad assures her that he will have enough time to procure the last of his needed ingredients. After Mrs. Fremont leaves, Fuad ventures to the back storage room where he has displayed a large gold statue of his \\"Egyptian goddess\\" Ishtar. Fuad is preparing a \\"blood feast\\" â a huge vat containing the dead women's body parts â that will ensure the goddess's resurrection. That evening, teenagers Tony and Marcy make out on a nearby beach. Fuad attacks them, subduing Tony and slicing off the top of Marcy's head. He removes her brain to serve as the latest ingredient. Thornton arrives on the scene with the police chief. After failing to obtain any useful information from the distraught Tony, they interrogate Marcy's mother, who can only tell Pete that her daughter belonged to a book club. Staking out a local motel, Fuad sees a drunken sailor drop his wife off at her room. Fuad knocks on the woman's door and attacks her when she opens it. Fuad rips the woman's tongue out through her throat as another ingredient to his \\"blood feast\\". Pete continues to investigate this latest killing, and discovers that the latest murder victim also belonged to a book club. Pete attends his weekly Egyptian Studies lecture at the local...","completion":"university, where the professor discusses the ancient ritual of the \\"blood feast\\" and the worship of the goddess Ishtar. The professor explains that in order to resurrect Ishtar, a devoted follower must prepare a feast using human body parts, and that each victim must have their tongue, brain, heart, and other vital organs harvested. Connecting the dots, Pete begins to suspect that the recent murders are not random acts of violence but are instead related to this ancient Egyptian ritual. He decides to investigate the background of the book club members and soon discovers that all of the murdered women were part of the same club. As Pete delves deeper into the case, he finds a link between the victims and Fuad Ramses Catering. Meanwhile, Fuad is gathering the final ingredients necessary for his blood feast, planning to use the party he's catering for Suzette Fremont as the perfect opportunity to resurrect Ishtar. As the night of the party approaches, Pete becomes increasingly desperate to warn Suzanne of the impending danger. On the day of the party, Pete heads to the Fremont residence to speak with Suzanne. When he arrives, he finds the house bustling with guests and party preparations already underway. As he searches for Suzanne amidst the chaos, Fuad begins the final preparations for the blood feast. The guests, completely unaware of the danger they're in, eagerly indulge in the lavish spread Fuad has put together. Finally, Pete locates Suzanne and manages to pull her aside to warn her of the grisly truth behind the party's catering. Shocked and horrified, Suzanne listens as Pete explains the ancient ritual and its connection to the recent murders. Realizing that they must act quickly to stop Fuad and save the lives of those at the party, Pete and Suzanne confront Fuad in the kitchen. Caught red-handed with remnants of his victims' body parts, Fuad tries to escape, leaving a trail of blood in his wake. Pete and Suzanne chase after him as guests and partygoers begin to discover the horrifying dishes they've been eating and panic ensues. As Pete and Suzanne corner Fuad, he defiantly claims that Ishtar will rise again before attempting a desperate attack. Pete manages to subdue Fuad before he can harm them, and the killer is ultimately arrested. As the police take Fuad away, Pete and Suzanne breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that they have stopped a dangerous killer and saved countless lives. While the horrifying events of the party will never be forgotten, they hope to move on and learn from the ordeal, forever grateful for the chance to save others from becoming a part of the blood feast."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is currently Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University. Sowell was born in North Carolina, but grew up in Harlem, New York. Sowell has also written a trilogy of books on ideologies and political positions, including A Conflict of Visions, where he speaks about the origins of political strife; The Vision of the Anointed, where he compares the conservative/libertarian and liberal/progressive worldviews; and The Quest for Cosmic Justice, where, as in many of his other writings, he outlines his thesis of the need for intellectuals, politicians and leaders to fix and perfect the world in utopian, and ultimately he posits, disastrous fashions. Separate from the trilogy, but also in discussion of the subject, he wrote Intellectuals and Society, where, building on his earlier work, he discusses what he argues to be the blind hubris and follies of intellectuals in a variety of areas. Sowell challenges the notion that black progress is due to progressive government programs or policies, in The Economics and Politics of Race, (1983), Ethnic America (1981), Affirmative Action Around the World (2004), and other books. He claims that many problems identified with blacks in modern society are not unique, either in terms of American ethnic groups, or in terms of a rural proletariat struggling with disruption as it became urbanized, as discussed in his book Black Rednecks and White Liberals (2005). In Affirmative Action Around the World Sowell holds that affirmative action covers most of the American population, particularly women, and has long since ceased to favor blacks. Sowell described his serious study of Karl Marx in his autobiography. He opposes Marxism, providing a critique in his book Marxism: Philosophy and Economics (2011). Sowell also favors decriminalization of all drugs. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Who is Thomas Sowell and what does he write about?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Webb Simpson equalled the score, which is one short of course record.","completion":"Title: Exciting Times at the Sony Open - Paul Casey and Webb Simpson Shine Bright! Hey kids, let me tell you about an exciting event that happened in the world of golf! A wonderful English golfer named Paul Casey played a fantastic game at the Sony Open held in the beautiful land of Hawaii. Do you know what a \\"round\\" is in golf? It's kind of like a level in a video game, and there are usually four levels you play. So, in the first level (or \\"round\\" as they call it), Paul Casey played really, really well. He was able to get a score of 62, which is pretty amazing because it means he didn't need a lot of shots to get the ball into the hole. Now, there is a special trick in golf called a \\"birdie.\\" A birdie is when a golfer takes one shot less than what is expected to finish a hole. So, if you think it should take 4 shots, but the golfer does it in 3 – that's a birdie! What's super cool is that Paul Casey made nine birdies during his time on the golf course. But wait, there was another fantastic golfer at the Sony Open too! His name is Webb Simpson. Here's the exciting part: Webb Simpson got the same score as Paul Casey! He too scored 62 points, which is just one point away from breaking the course record. A course record is the best ever score made by a golfer on a particular golf course. So, in simple words, both of these amazing golfers - Paul Casey from England and Webb Simpson from America - played super-duper well at the Sony Open in Hawaii. They both scored a fantastic 62 points in the first round, making lots of birdies and coming very, very close to setting a new course record.

Are you ready to learn something new today? Well, let me tell you a story that will cheer you up and make you feel a little more confident about being yourself. Once upon a time, there was a young person who felt a little shy and unsure about themselves. They thought that they had to be just like everyone else to make friends and find someone special to love. But guess what? That's not true at all! It's important to be ourselves and enjoy what we like. So, let's find out how to be our best selves, okay? First, we have to remember that it's totally okay to like what we like, even if other people don't like the same things. Maybe you really like collecting bugs or drawing pictures with your crayons. That's great! And we don't need to feel embarrassed about it. It's important to be proud of our interests. Next, we can try to find new friends in the places we like to be. So, if you love playing at the park, maybe that's where you'll find friends who enjoy the same thing as you do. It's always more fun to be with people who like the same things as we do, isn't it? Now, let's talk about our style. You know how sometimes you see people wearing cool hats or colorful socks? That's because they're showing off their own special style! We can do that too. We can choose what we like to wear or how to decorate our notebooks for school. It's all about being unique and special, just like you. One important thing to remember is always to be open and sincere with others. That means we should be honest and kind when we talk to people. Let them know about your interests and ask about theirs. The more we learn about each other, the closer we can become as friends. Lastly, remember that before we can love other people, we need to love ourselves first! This means that we need to be happy with who we are and take good care of our body, mind, and heart. When we love ourselves, it's much easier for others to love us too. So, little buddy, remember that being yourself is the best way to find friends and love. Don't be ashamed of your interests, find friends in the places you like, show off your unique style, and always be open and sincere with others. Most importantly, love yourself and others will love you too. Now go out there and shine like the special person you are!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Houston Mayor Annise Parker (AP) Author's note: Friday, the City of Houston filed a revised subpoena removing the word “sermons” among the documents being demanded, but leaving the word “speeches.” Legally, this changes nothing. It is a distinction without a difference. City Attorney Feldman apparently didn’t bother to check a dictionary (any dictionary will do) which describes “sermons” as “religious discourse or speech.” Pastors are therefore still required to turn over to the city their sermons. Feldman is fooling no one. “Mr. Jarrett… did you bring your toothbrush?” Those were the words of the Honorable Ira Brown as the imperious “law and motion” judge stared down at me from his bench. I was shaking in my discount loafers. You see, I was being taken to task for issuing a subpoena for documents which I likely had no right to have. That’s when I started groveling. “Upon reflection, Your Honor, I realize now that I have overstepped my authority and would like to withdraw my subpoena duces tecum. With Your Honor’s permission, of course… uh, respectfully, sir.” My voice was cracking, and opposing counsel was quietly cracking up with laughter. It was 1980 and I was fresh out of law school. I didn’t know any better. But my humiliation was a lesson well learned. Do not, under any circumstances, exceed the bounds of your power as an attorney to issue subpoenas. After a painful scolding on the responsibilities of a lawyer, Judge Brown allowed me to crawl out of his San Francisco courtroom without holding me in contempt of court and tossing me in the hoosegow overnight. If the late Judge Brown were presiding over the current litigation involving Houston’s new non-discrimination ordinance (Woodfill v. Parker), the city attorney would be well advised to bring his toothbrush. And a lot of toothpaste. In my view, he has blatantly abused his power and discretion. How? By issuing subpoenas to a group of pastors demanding they cough up the contents of their sermons. On subjects like gender identity, homosexuality or Houston’s openly lesbian mayor. But here’s the problem: whatever was preached from a pulpit has nothing whatsoever to do with a lawsuit challenging the city’s decision to invalidate a referendum petition. The sermons are not even tangential to whether signatures are valid. To argue otherwise is inane. Let’s begin with the basics. Lawyers have the power, granted by court process, to issue subpoenas involving civil cases in which they represent one or more of the parties. They do not have to go running to a judge or court clerk every time they want to force someone to turn over documents and appear for deposition or in court. However, there is an important caveat. The subpoena may only seek information that is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. In other words, you can’t just demand anything and everything. The information you seek has to be directly relevant to the case. Something that would lead to acceptable evidence at trial. So-called “fishing expeditions” are strictly prohibited. The case which gives the Houston lawyers subpoena power is a lawsuit that, put simply, claims Houston’s mayor and city attorney were wrong in declaring petition signatures invalid. So the question before the court is whether the petitioners met the terms, conditions and requirements under the city charter. All the political posturing and war of words from pulpits to street corners is utterly irrelevant. It would never be admissible as evidence in court. If some pastors have voiced an opinion on the city’s new law which the referendum seeks to overturn, so what? Their words are legally unrelated and immaterial to the case. Moreover, their speech is protected by the First Amendment. Thus, when the city attorney started demanding the content of sermons he overstepped the bounds of his authority. Some of these pastors are not even parties to the litigation. This is a serious abuse of power. When a lawyer abuses the court’s process by the misuse of subpoenas, the punishment can be a finding of contempt of court. What then? It’s up to the judge. Usually it is a fine or the paying of the other side’s attorney’s fees. In extreme cases, a lawyer may find himself behind bars. I wonder what the city attorney and mayor are trying to do with their erroneous subpoenas. Silence critics? Intimidate or “chill” dissent? Deprive people of their free speech rights? That’s the stuff of bullies. But using the court process is against the law. Mayor Annise Parker now claims she knew nothing about the subpoena. The City Attorney, David Feldman, is blaming outside counsel for writing it. Really? Good luck with that one. We’ll see if the judge presiding over the case is buying any of this nonsense. One thing is certain: Feldman is lucky it’s not Judge Ira Brown up there on the bench peering down. Trust me, Mr. City Attorney, you’d be shaking in your loafers and packing a toothbrush. Gregg Jarrett is a Fox News Anchor and former defense attorney.","completion":"Title: \\"Houston City Attorney Oversteps Bounds: The Abuse of Subpoena Power and Its Consequences\\" In this article, the author discusses a case involving Houston's new non-discrimination ordinance (Woodfill v.

The author argues that this is a blatant abuse of power because the sermons have no connection to the lawsuit challenging the city's decision to invalidate a referendum petition. Subpoenas in civil cases should only seek information that is reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence and must be directly relevant to the case.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. A group of model-caliber San Francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre Valentine's Day cards. Who is the killer and why is the killer after them? My rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. However, I can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for Valentine. The first time I watched it, upon its theatrical release, I thought it was pretty awful--I gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an \\"F\\" letter grade. Watching it for a second time last night, I can't remember what the heck I didn't like about it. I can only assume that maybe I was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe I just didn't get it. In any event, I loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an \\"A\\". It might sound ridiculous saying I didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. Valentine is almost a comedy/horror. Director Jamie Blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's Urban Legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of Scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making Valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). On top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. The humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. Most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the Valentine's Day theme. Many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. However, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. It's as if Blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. That's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on Valentine's Day. It's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for Valentine's extravagant lampooning. Scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was \\"self-aware\\". Valentine's Day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. Lest some think I'm \\"reading too much\\" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that Blanks said in interviews that he \\"didn't want to just do another slasher film after Urban Legend\\" and producer Dylan Sellers said he wanted to do something \\"more adult\\". Other viewers may dislike the fact that Valentine's Day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by Tom Savage. The novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. Sellers has said, \\"While it was a fine book, I didn't think it was the right story for a film\\". So instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on Valentine's Day. While those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. It's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme. Blanks' direction is impeccable visually. Valentine's Day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. Blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. He also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. David Boreanaz, as Adam Carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments. While Valentine's Day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. If you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. The reviewer acknowledges that their rating drastically changed upon rewatching the film, as they now appreciate its comedy/horror elements, campy tone, and smart use of the Valentine's Day theme. The direction, visuals, and performances are highly praised. Although it is not considered a masterpiece, the reviewer believes it is a very good horror/thriller film that may be misunderstood or underappreciated."},{"prompt":"Do you think the right answer to the question \\"lobsters have special structures for:\\" is \\"cooking\\", given that lobsters have special excretory structures?

The Twitter Followholic: An Epidemic Elliott Kosmicki is the founder of GoodPlum.com, a productivity and personal development blog for home business owners. You can also follow Elliott on Twitter. It’s an illness. It’s a disease that attacks the brain, affecting the response of your fingers on the keyboard and mouse. “Stop clicking,” you say to yourself as another follow button has turned into a green-checked following icon. The first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem: you’re a followholic and you can’t stay away from a Twitter user’s follow button. (Say it out loud: My name is ______, and I’m a followholic.) You each have your reasons for becoming a followholic. Maybe your parents didn’t pay enough attention to you, so you’re reaching out to strange Tweeple on the Internet. Perhaps it’s genetic… If your father was a followholic, your twice as likely to become one as an adult. The facts* are cruel, but true. *The facts I speak of are not actual facts, but made up for this article. I would venture to say that most followholics started with the feeling of need. The need to get more followers, then turn to a reliance on the reciprocal-follow… However, this causes the people on each end of the follow to become followholics for separate reasons: Need and sympathy. Like MySpace a few years ago, people have become attached to the number of followers they have. They see someone with 12,000 followers and all of a sudden their 150 followers seems worthless. Their focus changes from networking and learning about their audience to a raw desire to gain as many followers as humanly possible. In reality, the number of followers you have should simply reflect the quality of what you give. If you’re following 1,000 people, and have somehow got 800 of those people to follow you back, it doesn’t really mean that much. But if 800 people have come across you on their own and started following you, while you’re only following the 80 people you care about – that says something about your value. It says that people follow you because you’re valuable, not because you’ve started following them first. You don’t NEED to follow every profile you come across – you only need to follow the people who you find interesting and valuable to your everyday life. Follow them if you would talk to them in real life. “Aw, that’s so sweet… this guy I never heard of who has no description filled out, no website, and only 4 tweets started following me… I’ll follow him back, poor guy!” Reciprocal-following is, in my opinion, one of the most dangerous time wasters. Whether you follow back manually or through auto-following – if you spend a lot of time with a Twitter app open during the day, you’re clogging your screen and brain with information from people you really don’t care to see. Not only that, but you’re preventing yourself from building a relationship with your followers. How are you supposed to engage 12,000 people adequately? There’s no room for you in conversation if you’ve diluted yourself like that. There is no need to feel sympathetic to people on Twitter. Follow them back if you find them interesting and valuable to your everyday life. Follow them back if you would talk to them in real life. There seems to be a pattern emerging… I follow people based on the idea that if I had to slide a quarter into their Twitter page in order to activate the Follow button – would I still follow them? If I’m following you, it’s because I would pay for your updates. Either you do something interesting, you seem helpful to others, I know you in some way – or would like to know you. If you’re following 10,000 people, would you have paid 2,500 for the privilege of having to sort through that many Tweets every day? Somehow I doubt it. I mostly doubt it because it’s impossible to do. There is no way you’re paying attention to the people you care about if you’ve clicked “Follow” on every profile you’ve ever seen on Twitter. Do you have guidelines for yourself about who you’ll follow? If not, feel free to take mine: You’ll only follow people you’d be willing to pay to follow. Admit you have a problem: If you can’t pay attention to the amount of people you’re following in a manner you would want someone to pay attention to you, you’re a followholic. Admit it, realize that it’s killing your productivity and value, then take steps to overcome it. Clean your contacts: If you’re following only people you’re interested in – you’ll never have to do this step. But if you’re like most people on Twitter – you’ve fallen down a slippery slope and need to recover. Start by getting rid of the riff-raff. Use Twitter Karma to clean your contact list once. This is a simple tool that shows people you follow, and who follows you back. This is your chance to stop following the people you simply clicked “Follow” to try and get them to follow you back, but they never did. Manage incoming followers: First, turn off auto-follow in whatever program you’re using to do it. There is no possible way that anyone legitimately wants to follow back everyone who follows them. This isn’t up for discussion. Once that’s complete, try a tool like Tweepler. Tweepler allows you to see all the people you haven’t sorted through yet. You’ll see their bio, website, and more – all from a single screen. I’d be totally lost without this. The first time you load it up, it may take you a while to sort everyone out, but once you’ve done it – you can probably come back once per week and it’ll be a more manageable list. Run Twitoria every so often. This site allows you to instantly see anyone you are following who is “inactive.” I run this every month or so – because it’s natural to come upon someone you find interesting, but then that person just never uses Twitter again. Since that’s the case, I choose to unfollow them (and get my money back) – thus keeping my list more manageable. Remember – you’re only going to follow people who you find interesting and valuable to your everyday life! Follow them if you would talk to them in real life. Finding people to follow: One of the biggest problems people have at first is finding quality people to follow on Twitter. This leads to following everyone, and eventually to becoming a followholic. This not only makes your time on Twitter less worthwhile, but it can become a productivity nightmare to try and pay attention to all the people you’re following. My first suggestion is to start with Twitter Search. This allows you to search everything everyone has ever tweeted. By searching for topics you’re interested in, you’re very likely to come across people who have similar interests as you. Next, try a service like Mr. Tweet. Simply visit Mr. Tweet’s Twitter page, follow him, and he’ll collect information about you in order to suggest people you might like to follow. Who knows, he might even suggest me! The last tool I love to use to find people is Grader. Grader is meant to “score” Twitter users based on followers, Tweet rate, etc. But I love using it to find popular Tweeple in my area. First, look yourself up on Grader. Then, find the area where it says your city/state. Click on those to see the top Twitter users in your area. Once you’re free of the follow epidemic, you can use Twitter to network, respond to people in a timely manner, become more engaged in conversation, and better learn about the people you’ve chosen to follow. This, after all, is what social media is all about! I understand that some people who read this will take it personally – it’ll feel like I’m speaking to them, and that I’m saying what they’re doing is wrong. I’m fine if you’re using Twitter to run up a follower number, blast your marketing message to people, or announce 5 times in one day that your followers shouldn’t miss your upcoming conference call. I don’t take that personally. However, when I try to help people on a daily basis figure out the best way to use Twitter in their business, how to find and produce quality and personality on Twitter, don’t take it personally that I won’t be referring them to you.

Write an article based on this summary: A woman has been killed by a shark while swimming off a popular beach in Australia's New South Wales.","completion":"Title: Shark Accident Takes a Woman's Life near Popular Beach in Australia Once upon a time, in a place called New South Wales in Australia, there was a very popular beach where many people loved to go. They would swim, play in the sand, and have fun in the sun. People of all ages, even kids like you, enjoyed spending their days at the beach with their families and friends. One unfortunate day, a sad thing happened. A woman was swimming in the water off the beach when suddenly, a big fish called a shark came by. You might have seen a shark on TV or in books - they have big fins and sharp teeth and live in the ocean. Well, this shark got too close to the woman and hurt her really badly. Even though it doesn't happen very often, sometimes sharks accidentally hurt people when they swim in the ocean. We don't know why exactly, but sharks might think the person is a fish or a seal they usually eat. It's important to know that sharks are not bad or naughty, they are just doing what they naturally do. This time, the shark hurt the woman so much that she couldn't survive her injuries, and she passed away. This made many people sad, including her family and friends who loved her very much. Everyone at the beach was also sad and scared because this incident made them realize the dangers of swimming in the ocean. The people who take care of the beach and keep it safe, like lifeguards and other grown-ups, decided to find ways to make sure everyone is safe when they are swimming and playing in the water. They might put up signs and teach everyone how to be careful around the water, especially when sharks are nearby. So, even though this is a sad story, we can learn from it and be more aware of the world around us. The next time you go to a beach, remember to stay close to your family and be careful when playing near the water. And if you ever see a sign about sharks or someone tells you a shark is nearby, listen carefully and stay safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: who embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by Pilot Cassie? Kaneda and capa Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Cosmic Voyage: The Stratosphere Chronicles\\" Step 1: Establish the setting The story is set in the year 2077, where space exploration has become commonplace, and humanity has established colonies on various celestial bodies throughout the galaxy. The Earth Federation, a governing body formed to manage the shared interests of humanity, has commissioned a cutting-edge research vessel, the Stratosphere, for a crucial deep-space mission to gather valuable data on an unknown cosmic anomaly. Step 2: Introduce the characters Dr. Kaneda Akiyama is the seasoned lead scientist and engineer aboard starship Stratosphere, possessing a strong yet stoic personality. Kaneda is a brilliant mind with experience and skills in advanced technology crucial for this mission. Dr. Elijah Capa is a resourceful and intelligent astrophysicist, hand-picked by Kaneda for his expertise in celestial mechanics and particle physics. Capa's abundance of curiosity becomes instrumental during the critical moments of the mission. Lieutenant Cassandra \\"Cassie\\" Reyes is the skilled pilot of the Stratosphere, a fearless and confident astronaut who exhibits extraordinary talent in navigating the unknown reaches of space. Her intuition and quick thinking often help her avoid catastrophic disasters. Step 3: Develop the conflict During their journey to the unknown cosmic anomaly, the Stratosphere encounters a powerful electromagnetic field that surrounds their destination. The force of the cosmic event damages the Stratosphere's essential systems and communications, leaving it vulnerable in the depths of space. Step 4: Initiate the spacewalk and trial As the only crew members capable of performing the necessary repairs to maintain the Stratosphere's systems, Kaneda and Capa gear up for a perilous spacewalk. Cassie, who remains in the Stratosphere's cockpit, is responsible for assisting the duo by providing instructions and monitoring their movements to ensure they remain in constant contact and finish the repairs efficiently. Step 5: Encounter unexpected challenges While performing the repairs, Kaneda and Capa uncover a mysterious signal emitting from the cosmic anomaly. They are soon confronted with a dangerous threat: an extraterrestrial entity that was drawn to the cosmic event, and now seeks to consume the Earth's solar energy. Step 6: Resolve the conflict and realize the potential consequences of inaction To save Earth from this impending doom, Kaneda, Capa, and Cassie must work together to devise a plan to destroy the extraterrestrial menace. They come up with a strategy that involves using the Stratosphere's experimental technology to redirect solar energy from the nearby star to create a devastating blast, capable of destroying the entity. The crucial moment arrives, and the three crew members execute their plan, with the fate of Earth resting in their hands. Step 7: Climax and conclusion The plan works but comes at a substantial sacrifice. The Stratosphere sustains critical damage during the confrontation, leaving the ship's fate uncertain. However, the legacy of the crew is celebrated throughout Earth as heroes who protected their planet against a cosmic threat. \\"Cosmic Voyage: The Stratosphere Chronicles\\" showcases courage, teamwork, and humanity's will to survive against overwhelming odds while also emphasizing the importance of scientific progress and exploration in understanding the universe."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: A device that stops drivers from falling asleep at the wheel is about to undergo testing at Department of Transport laboratories and could go on sale within 12 months. The system, called Driver Alert, aims to reduce deadly road accidents by 20% - 40% that are caused by tiredness. Airline pilots can also use it to reduce the 30% of all pilot-error accidents that are related to fatigue. Driver Alert is based on a computerized wristband. The device, worn by drivers or pilots, gives out a sound about every four minutes during a car journey. After each sound the driver must respond by squeezing the steering wheel. A sensor in the wristband detects this pressing action and measures the time between the sound the driver's response. Tiredness is directly related to a driver's response time. Usually, a watchful driver would take about 400 milliseconds to respond, but once that falls to more than 500 milliseconds, it suggests that the driver is getting sleepy. In such cases the device gives out more regular and louder sounds, showing that the driver should open a window or stop for a rest. If the driver's response continues to slow down, the sounds become more frequent until a nonstop alarm warns that the driver must stop as soon as possible. The device has been delivered to the department's laboratories for testing. If these tests, scheduled for six months' time, are successful, the makers will bring the product to market within about a year.

Add 17*p to both sides of the equation to eliminate p from the right side. -66*p + 17*p + 1094 = -17*p + 17*p - 1699 -49*p + 1094 = - 1699 Now, move the constant 1094 to the right side of the equation by subtracting 1094 from both sides. -49*p + 1094 - 1094 = -1699 - 1094 -49*p = -2793 Step 3: Solve for p Divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of p, which is -49. -49*p / -49 = -2793 / -49 p = 57 So, the value of p is 57.

Let's analyze them step-by-step. Premise: \\"Though it lacked the size of the uninhabitable hydrogen-ammonia planets and its low density made its surface gravity fairly normal, its gravitational forces fell off but slowly with distance.\\" From this premise, we can infer: 1. The planet is smaller than hydrogen-ammonia planets. 2. The planet has a low density. 3. Its surface gravity is fairly normal. 4. Its gravitational forces decrease slowly with distance.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - A mound is a heaped pile of earth, gravel, sand, rocks, or debris. Most commonly, mounds are earthen formations such as hills and mountains, particularly if they appear artificial. A mound may be any rounded area of topographically higher elevation on any surface. Artificial mounds have been created for a variety of reasons throughout history, including ceremonial (platform mound), burial (tumulus), and commemorative purposes (e.g. Kociuszko Mound). - A kame is a geomorphological feature, an irregularly shaped hill or mound composed of sand, gravel and till that accumulates in a depression on a retreating glacier, and is then deposited on the land surface with further melting of the glacier. Kames are often associated with kettles, and this is referred to as \\"kame and kettle\\" topography. - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec) were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area. - Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. It stands on the south bank of the Ottawa River in the eastern portion of southern Ontario. Ottawa borders Gatineau, Quebec; the two form the core of the OttawaGatineau census metropolitan area (CMA) and the National Capital Region (NCR). The 2011 census reported a population of 883,391, making it the fourth-largest city in Canada; and 1,236,324 within the CMA, making it the fourth-largest CMA in Canada. The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. - Montreal officially Montréal in both Canadian English and French, is the most populous municipality in Quebec and the 2nd-most populous in Canada. Originally called \\"Ville-Marie\\", or \\"City of Mary,\\" it is named after Mount Royal, the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. The city is on the Island of Montreal, which took its name from the same source as the city, and a few much smaller peripheral islands, the largest of which is Île Bizard. It has a distinct four-season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters. - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water. - Till or glacial till is unsorted glacial sediment. Till is derived from the erosion and entrainment of material by the moving ice of a glacier. It is deposited some distance down-ice to form terminal, lateral, medial and ground moraines. - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - Minnitaki Lake is a large lake with numerous islands in Kenora District, Ontario, Canada. The nearest city is Sioux Lookout. - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - The Northwest Territories (also known as NWT; French: \\"les Territoires du Nord-Ouest\\", \\"TNO\\"; Athabaskan languages: \\"Denendeh\\"; Inuinnaqtun: \\"Nunatsiaq\\"; Inuktitut: ) is a territory of Canada. At a land area of approximately and a 2011 population of 41,462, it is the second largest and most populous of the three territories in Northern Canada. Its estimated population as of 2016 is 44,291. Yellowknife became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the Carrothers Commission. - Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological and/or cultural values. There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organisations involved. The term \\"protected area\\" also includes Marine Protected Areas, the boundaries of which will include some area of ocean, and Transboundary Protected Areas that overlap multiple countries which remove the borders inside the area for conservation and economic purposes. There are over 161,000 protected areas in the world (as of October 2010) with more added daily, representing between 10 and 15 percent of the world's land surface area. By contrast, only 1.17% of the world's oceans is included in the world's ~6,800 Marine Protected Areas. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. In 2015 the city had a population estimate of 545,485, and the metropolitan area had a population of 806,400, making it Canada's seventh-largest metropolitan area and Quebec's second-largest city after Montreal, which is about to the southwest. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - Sand is a naturally occurring granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. It is defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt. Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e. a soil containing more than 85% sand-sized particles by mass. - Melting, or fusion, is a physical process that results in the phase transition of a substance from a solid to a liquid. This occurs when the internal energy of the solid increases, typically by the application of heat or pressure, which increases the substance's temperature to the melting point. At the melting point, the ordering of ions or molecules in the solid breaks down to a less ordered state, and the solid melts to become a liquid. - Minnitaki Kames Provincial Park is a 4,422 - hectare ( 10,930 - acre ) nature reserve in Ontario , Canada , designated to protect several distinguishing features , including east - west kame ridges and numerous terraces . It abuts the shores of Minnitaki Lake , with the nearest settlement at Sioux Lookout , about 20 km to the north . Each of the five large kames , the largest in northwestern Ontario , \`\` is completely covered by an extensive jack pine dominated closed coniferous forest '' . The largest covers over 12 square kilometres , rising about 30 m above the gently sloping bedrock , which attains elevations between 358 m and 437 m. These glacial features are related to Lake Agassiz , and were deposited about 9,500 to 10,000 years ago during the Timiskaming Interstadial . - A nature reserve (natural reserve, bioreserve, (natural/nature) preserve or (national/nature) conserve) is a protected area of importance for wildlife, flora, fauna or features of geological or other special interest, which is reserved and managed for conservation and to provide special opportunities for study or research. Nature reserves may be designated by government institutions in some countries, or by private landowners, such as charities and research institutions, regardless of nationality. Nature reserves fall into different IUCN categories depending on the level of protection afforded by local laws. - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area.

It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's political map since the incorporation of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949. - Calgary is a city in the Canadian province of Alberta. It is situated at the confluence of the Bow River and the Elbow River in the south of the province, in an area of foothills and prairie, about east of the front ranges of the Canadian Rockies. In the 2011 census, the City of Calgary had a population of 1,096,833 and a metropolitan population of 1,214,839, making it the largest city in Alberta, and the third-largest municipality and fifth-largest census metropolitan area (CMA) in Canada. - Topography is the study of the shape and features of the surface of the Earth and other observable astronomical objects including planets, moons, and asteroids. The topography of an area could refer to the surface shapes and features themselves, or a description (especially their depiction in maps). - Gravel is composed of unconsolidated rock fragments that have a general particle size range and include size classes from granule- to boulder-sized fragments. Gravel is categorized by the Udden-Wentworth scale into granular gravel and pebble gravel.

To better understand the answer, let's analyze the given sentences: In Sentence 1, the speaker agrees to participate in an R2000-1 postmortem conference under two conditions: (1) they speak before Gene, and (2) they are not subjected to Florida's erratic weather. In Sentence 2, Norm informs the speaker that they cannot go to the conference. From the information provided, it is not possible to determine whether the second sentence is true or not if the first sentence is true. This is because there is no indication of whether the two conditions set forth in Sentence 1 have been met or not. If both conditions from Sentence 1 are met, then the speaker would have agreed to participate in the conference, and Sentence 2 would be false as it contradicts the agreement based on the conditions. However, if even one of the conditions is not met, then the speaker would presumably refuse to participate in the conference, which would then make Sentence 2 true, as Norm informed the speaker that they cannot go to the conference. In this scenario, without any additional information on the two conditions stated in Sentence 1, the relationship between the two sentences cannot be determined conclusively.

Question: Information: - Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (6 May 1880 15 June 1938) was a German expressionist painter and printmaker and one of the founders of the artists group Die Brücke or \\"The Bridge\\", a key group leading to the foundation of Expressionism in 20th-century art. He volunteered for army service in the First World War, but soon suffered a breakdown and was discharged. In 1933, his work was branded as \\"degenerate\\" by the Nazis and in 1937, over 600 of his works were sold or destroyed. In 1938, he committed suicide by gunshot. - Modern art includes artistic work produced during the period extending roughly from the 1860s to the 1970s, and denotes the style and philosophy of the art produced during that era. The term is usually associated with art in which the traditions of the past have been thrown aside in a spirit of experimentation. Modern artists experimented with new ways of seeing and with fresh ideas about the nature of materials and functions of art. A tendency away from the narrative, which was characteristic for the traditional arts, toward abstraction is characteristic of much modern art. More recent artistic production is often called contemporary art or postmodern art. - Expressionism was a modernist movement, initially in poetry and painting, originating in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century. Its typical trait is to present the world solely from a subjective perspective, distorting it radically for emotional effect in order to evoke moods or ideas. Expressionist artists sought to express the meaning of emotional experience rather than physical reality. - Die Brücke (The Bridge) was a group of German expressionist artists formed in Dresden in 1905, after which the Brücke Museum in Berlin was named. Founding members were Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff. Later members were Emil Nolde, Max Pechstein and Otto Mueller. The seminal group had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and the creation of expressionism. - Erich Heckel ( 31 July 1883 in Döbeln -- 27 January 1970 in Radolfzell ) was a German painter and printmaker , and a founding member of the group Die Brücke ( \`\` The Bridge '' ) which existed 1905 - 1913 .

' \` what with ? we could probably build enough for another fifty , but not two thousand . ' \` pity we ca n't bring moon nearer , ' said amethyst . \` you are brilliant , ' said","completion":"Amethyst's question about building more bases highlighted the challenges faced by the inhabitants in their search for sustainable solutions. Rocky's suggestion to grow more food also demonstrated the need to address not only immediate concerns, but also long-term growth and development. To begin with, the conversation between Rocky and Amethyst emphasizes the difficult balancing act between meeting current population needs while also planning for future expansion. Building more bases is a natural response to a growing population, but there are limitations on how quickly and efficiently these can be constructed. The suggestion of accommodating another fifty individuals showcases the strain on resources and infrastructure. Furthermore, the discussion of growing more food raises the important topic of agricultural development and resource management. Rocky's question about \\"what with?\\" highlights the underlying issue of resource scarcity, most notably arable land and water. Developing new farming methods or expanding existing ones is a potential solution; however, the necessary resources are finite and require careful management. Amethyst's seemingly whimsical suggestion to bring the moon nearer is actually more insightful than it first appears. While she may not have meant this statement literally, her train of thought can be interpreted as a call for exploring new technologies and opportunities, particularly those related to space exploration. Moon colonization, for instance, would unquestionably provide additional living space and resource extraction opportunities – reducing the pressure on Earth's limited resources. Upon hearing Amethyst's comment, the subsequent praise from an unspecified speaker demonstrates the realization that innovative thinking is crucial in addressing complex problems. By thinking beyond conventional solutions, they stand a better chance at finding sustainable ways of addressing their needs. In summary, the conversation between Rocky and Amethyst touches on important themes related to sustainable development, resource management, and the necessity of innovative thinking. Building more bases and growing more food are viable, albeit limited, options in the short term; however, the group must also consider long-term solutions such as exploring space and developing new technologies. As the inhabitants navigate these challenges, cultivating a mindset that is open to unconventional ideas, like Amethyst's moon notion, will be essential in ensuring their success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - That the reader failed to envision themselves correctly - That the reader needs to think more positively - not enough information - That the reader has lost all hope === The correct answer is A:","completion":"That the reader needs to think more positively The author's approach to imagining the ideal version of oneself is centered on creating a positive, optimistic, and growth-oriented image. This exercise aims to help individuals envision their most evolved selves and gain insight into the habits, mindset, and behaviors that contribute to living their best lives. When it comes to physical appearance, the author encourages readers to visualize a colorful, bright, and confident version of themselves. This would include aspects such as clothes, hairstyle, posture, vocal tone, and smile frequency. Additionally, the light and love in the eyes of this future self should be apparent. Emotionally, the ideal version of the reader is seen as having healthy and wholesome connections with their partner, children, and colleagues. They would know how to cope with bad days and find sources of rest and renewal to recharge themselves. Mentally, this evolved future self is characterized by positive optimism for the future. They are grateful for past struggles that have made them stronger and have a kind, loving attitude towards themselves. Self-care is paramount for them. Behavior-wise, the future self makes mindful food choices, prioritizing fresh and healthy meals in appropriate quantities. They exercise regularly and allow themselves to indulge in treats occasionally. Having a balanced lifestyle by getting enough sleep and taking care of their overall health is evident in this imagined self. The author believes that negative self-evolution is a result of not thinking positively or clearly enough about one's future self. By envisioning a more optimistic and detailed image of oneself, readers can better understand the choices they must make to reach their potential. In this mindset, every decision becomes an opportunity to ask, \\"What would the wonderful evolved me do?\\" and act accordingly. The author would likely feel that any negative self-evolution stems from a need for the reader to shift their mindset and work on building a clearer, more empowered image of their future selves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father and despises Doyle.

Given those answer options, answer the question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In 1996, when she was 4 years old, Catherine MacLean learned she had aplastic anemia. For seven years, she lived from hospital visit to hospital visit, one transfusion to the next. It wasn't until the summer of 2002 that her world suddenly included what was possible beyond the walls of her illness. She was 11. For many of the years in between, her disease controlled her life -- aplastic anemia is a type of bone marrow failure that made it impossible to produce enough red blood cells to support her body. In 2001, Catherine spent three weeks in isolation at a clinic so that she could get a bone marrow transplant. All visitors had to scrub down before entering the room, and her mother had to wear a surgical mask if she slept there. When she went back to school, Catherine had kept up academically, but the social environment at the school made for a difficult transition. \\"I was definitely clearly very aware that I was different from the other kids in my class, in a lot of ways -- in terms of maturity, in terms of risk taking,\\" Catherine told CNN. \\"There's just this gap in experience, because I've just done things and been to places that they just haven't.\\" To help her meet other kids who understood, Catherine's doctors encouraged her to go to a special summer camp for seriously ill children. The Hole in the Wall Gang Camps were started by actor Paul Newman \\"to acknowledge luck; the chance of it, the benevolence of it in my life, and the brutality of it in the lives of others, made especially savage for children because they may not be allowed the good fortune of a lifetime to correct it.\\" The camp Catherine attended, in Ashford, Connecticut, is staffed by cabin counselors, doctors and nurses, and it prides itself on giving kids a place where they will feel \\"safe, respected and loved.\\" For these kids, suffering from diseases such as hemophilia, sickle cell anemia and cancer, it is a chance to see past the walls of the hospital to what the world might be like if a diagnosis didn't control their every move, if clinics and hospital rooms weren't like second homes. CEO Jimmy Canton has been with the camp since it started in 1988. He describes it as a place where children are encouraged to look beyond what they thought was possible: \\"They've been told over and over again what they can't do. And camp reminds them that there's an enormous amount of things that they can do.\\" Nicole Kucine is a pediatric hematologist and oncologist who's getting more training at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and has volunteered at the camp for four years. Outside of the summer, she works closely with many sick children in hospitals and clinics; at the camp, she sees ill children in an entirely different light. What she sees -- children dancing around dining halls, inviting and insisting that she join in -- is invigorating. \\"Seeing kids kind of ignore their disease was amazing. That they have to take medicine when they eat their meals wasn't a big deal. They could be normal,\\" she told CNN. \\"Normal\\" was not something Catherine was that familiar with before camp. The start of camp coincided with the one-year anniversary of her transplant, and her doctors were just starting to use the word \\"cure.\\" At the camp, Catherine was embraced by young counselors, eager to get to know her. Many of the counselors were in college, which helped her envision what had for so long been an intangible future. \\"My sort of vision of my life had always been very narrowed, and it was always very much a day-by-day. It was like in a week, I have to get another blood transfusion, and in a couple months, we're gonna be changing my medication, and in a couple months, we're gonna transplant,\\" she told CNN. The experience allowed Catherine to think, \\"There's things out there. I can set long-terms goals now. I can have long-term goals. There's things that I'm going to be able to do.\\" The friends from her camp still provide support and understanding today, when \\"normal\\" life can get complicated. Explaining the intricacies of her illness could be daunting to a college freshman trying to make new friends. But her camp friends can commiserate over routine checkups and test results without requiring any explanation. The camp also changes the way children interact with authority figures. In hospitals, there are always many caretakers who often do things to sick children that are uncomfortable, like drawing blood or giving them medications. With events like \\"Silly Olympics,\\" the camp puts kids back in the driver's seat. Correctly answered trivia questions win campers the right to fling a spoonful of pudding in their counselor's face, or spray a counselor with a Super Soaker, or perhaps make lemonade mix in a counselor's mouth. \\"Silly Olympics is, here's this authority figure, but you're allowed to throw pudding at them, you're allowed to strike back, you're allowed to kind of take control of the situation in a way that a lot of these kids get control over their bodies and their lives just completely taken away from them,\\" Catherine said. \\"In the hospital, you're a patient, that's all you are; in a lot of ways, you are your illness. And here, you're getting up on stage and you're a singer or you're a wood shop craftsman or you're a fisherman, you get to try different things, and so you can take back a sense of 'I like to fish, I'm good at this, I discovered this talent,' \\" she told CNN. This year, as Catherine finishes up her first year of college, she looks forward to many possibilities, such as medical research and graduate school. But she says the camp has also opened up her eyes to the social side of medicine, and she is considering going into public health or pursuing a job that supports patients. But for now, she is just excited about her summer job. She'll be going back to the camp that changed her life, but this time as a counselor. For thousands of very sick children around the world, summer camp is not just a place to escape parents and make new friends. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

It's impossible to say To view fall foliage, it is essential to take into account the timing of the peak foliage in autumn, as the fall color season typically runs from late September to mid-October. Various factors can influence fall foliage, such as shorter days, colder nights, and the level of moisture in the ground. Here's a detailed guide on how to best view fall foliage: 1. Determine peak foliage timings: The first step is to determine when the peak foliage occurs in the area of interest. This can vary depending on the region and climate.

Does the sentence \\"This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly.\\" answer the question \\"Who uses a Valencian standard separate from Catalan?\\"","completion":"The sentence \\"This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly.\\" does not directly answer the question \\"Who uses a Valencian standard separate from Catalan?\\" However, it may provide a clue as to the type of people who are promoting a separate Valencian standard. Let's discuss this in more detail. To provide a comprehensive answer to the question \\"Who uses a Valencian standard separate from Catalan?\\", we first need to understand the historical and linguistic background behind the Valencian and Catalan languages. Valencian and Catalan are two variants of the same language, spoken in different regions of Spain. Valencian is the name given to the variety of Catalan spoken in the Valencian Community, while Catalan is spoken in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and the eastern part of Aragon. Despite being the same language, both variants have distinct local features in terms of pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar. However, the historical background and regional pride associated with the Valencian language has led some people to argue for the establishment of a separate Valencian standard, distinct from that of Catalan. This debate is not only linguistic but also political and social. Given this context, the sentence \\"This position is promoted by people who do not use Valencian regularly.\\" can be interpreted to mean that some individuals who are not regular Valencian speakers are the ones advocating for a separate standard. This may be because these people are influenced by political or nationalistic motivations, rather than linguistics. To answer the question \\"Who uses a Valencian standard separate from Catalan?\\" more specifically, we can infer the following: 1. The people who promote a separate Valencian standard might include political figures, nationalists, or any individuals who wish to emphasize the distinct identity of the Valencian Community. 2. People who don't have a strong linguistic background or don't actively speak Valencian might be influenced by these political or nationalistic motivations and might wish to maintain a separate Valencian identity by promoting a separate standard. It is important to note that this debate is complex and multifaceted, and it is not possible to give a simple answer to the question. There are also many Valencian speakers who consider Valencian and Catalan as the same language and adhere to the standardized Catalan norms. Nevertheless, certain groups and individuals continue to advocate for a separate Valencian standard, motivated by various reasons, including regional pride, local identity, or political motivations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Given the question: Of all the areas of learning the most important is the development of attitudes. Emotional reactions as well as logical thought processes affect the behavior of most people. \\"The burnt child fears the fire\\" is one instance; another is the rise of figures like Hitler. Both these examples point up the fact that attitudes come from experience. In the one case the experience was direct and impressive; in the other it was indirect and gradual. The classroom teacher in the elementary school is in strategic position to influence attitudes. This is true partly because children acquire attitudes from those adults whose word they respect. Another reason it is true is that pupils often search somewhat deeply into a subject in school that has only been touched upon at home or has possibly never occurred to them before. To a child who has previously acquire little knowledge of Mexico, his teacher's method of handling such a unit would greatly affect his attitude toward Mexicans. The teacher can develop proper attitudes through social studies, science matters, the very atmosphere of the classroom, etc. However, when children come to school with undesirable attitudes, it is unwise to attempt to change their feelings by criticizing them. The teacher can achieve the proper effect by helping them obtain constructive experience. To illustrate, first-grade pupils, afraid of policemen will probably change their attitudes after a classroom talk with the neighborhood officer in which he explains how he protects them. In the same way, a class of older children can develop attitudes through discussion, research, outside reading and all-day trips. Finally, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes, because her influence can be harmful she has personal prejudices. This is especially true in respect to controversial issues and questions of which children should be encouraged to reach their own decisions as result of objective analysis of all the facts.

Washington Is the Contest du Jour “I think we have been spending so much time on our differences that we never seem to spend time on what we have in common,” Mr. Obama said. He collected an endorsement from Gov. Christine Gregoire, who referred to Mr. Obama as a candidate who could “stop the division in politics.” When he walked onto the arena floor, the audience thundered with applause. It was one of the largest — and, it seemed, most adoring — crowds to greet Mr. Obama in recent weeks. “If you guys want to sit down, feel free,” he said. “No!” shouted the crowd, which proceeded to stand for nearly all of his 50-minute speech. With Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama engaged in a fight for delegates to the national convention, the state of Washington’s 78 pledged delegates are highly coveted by the two Democrats. Mr. Obama has been organizing in the state for nearly a year, with five offices here. Mrs. Clinton has spent as much time here as he has, and began running a television advertisement this week, focusing on health care. But Mrs. Clinton, who has not done as well in the caucus states as Mr. Obama has, winning only two of nine so far, suggested that she did not expect to win in Washington, as many of her supporters would be too busy working to break away from their schedules and spend the time to caucus for her. “If this were a primary, where everybody could vote all day, I’d feel pretty good about it,” she said. “But it’s not. It’s a caucus.” In addition to Washington, Louisiana and Nebraska are also holding contests on Saturday. Mr. Obama spent time Thursday in Louisiana, which has a primary, and in Nebraska, which has a caucus, before arriving in Seattle. Mrs. Clinton has not campaigned recently in Louisiana or Nebraska, though her husband appeared in Louisiana on Friday. “There are no states that we write off,” Mr. Obama told reporters Friday morning at a news conference before the Key Arena rally. “On Saturday, if we come out of here with momentum and with additional delegates, that will help to lay the groundwork for what happens in Maryland and Virginia three days later. And that, in turn, will have an impact for how voters in Ohio and Texas perceive my candidacy.” Mrs. Clinton’s advisers spent Friday trying to lower expectations for her performance not just in the Washington caucuses, but in nominating contests throughout February. “The states in play this month do favor Senator Obama,” said Howard Wolfson, a Clinton spokesman, during a conference call with reporters. He cited Mr. Obama’s endorsements and his lead in the polls in states like Virginia. “We feel considerably better about the states on March 4.” Those states include Ohio and Texas, and more and more they are being seen as a chance to bring clarity to the neck-and-neck nominating fight. Campaign aides in Washington and other states were scheduled to be dispatched to Ohio and Texas as early as Sunday. Mr. Obama intends to spend considerable time in both states, as well as in Wisconsin, which holds its primary Feb. 19. “Within the Democratic Party, the Clinton brand name is very strong,” Mr. Obama said. “We have to do more work in order for people to peel off from something that they’re familiar with.” On Friday morning, Mrs. Clinton’s advisers fought back against impressions that the campaign was short on cash, announcing that more than 8 million in online donations had been collected since Tuesday, bringing the campaign’s February total to nearly 10 million Both Democratic candidates left Washington State on Friday, making their way to the states coming up next on the presidential nominating calendar. The Maine Democratic caucuses are Sunday, followed by primaries in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia on Tuesday. Mrs. Clinton had challenged Mr. Obama to a debate in Maine, but he declined, saying he believes that after 18 debates, voters have had sufficient opportunity to see the two candidates. He has agreed, however, to two debates before March 4, in Ohio and Texas. Julie Bosman reported from Tacoma, Wash., and Jeff Zeleny from Seattle. Katharine Q. Seelye contributed reporting.

Kendall paid Sasha's cable bill and also bought her groceries. Given the context: What will Kendall want to do next? Possible answers: be thanked, be nice, take a swim","completion":"To determine what Kendall might want to do next, let's consider the context and analyze the possible answers step-by-step. Step 1: Assess the context - Kendall has helped Sasha by paying her cable bill and buying her groceries. This indicates that Kendall is a helpful and considerate person, likely valuing positive relationships and assisting others. Step 2: Evaluate the possible answers in relation to the context 1. Be thanked: Given that Kendall has helped Sasha, it is natural for her to expect gratitude or a thank you from Sasha. This would validate Kendall's efforts and contribute to a positive relationship between them. 2. Be nice: Kendall has already demonstrated a nice gesture by helping Sasha. However, the question implies what Kendall would want to do next, so continuing to be nice might not be the best answer, as Kendall has already shown kindness. 3. Take a swim: This option seems unrelated to the context. It might be something Kendall would like to do for personal reasons, but there is no clear connection to the situation with Sasha. Step 3: Conclude Based on the context and possible answers, the most appropriate answer is that Kendall would want to be thanked next. This aligns with the dynamics of the situation and human expectations when someone helps another person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If \\"A shirtless man with a cigarette stands while a second man in sunglasses and a red shirt points at the first.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A shirtless gorilla with a cigarette stands.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"A shirtless gorilla with a cigarette stands\\" from the given statement \\"A shirtless man with a cigarette stands while a second man in sunglasses and a red shirt points at the first.\\" Here's an analysis of why the conclusion does not logically follow from the statement: 1. The original statement discusses two men: one shirtless man with a cigarette and the other in sunglasses and a red shirt. These two figures are the focus of the statement, and no other individuals, including gorillas, are mentioned or implied. 2. The characteristics of the mentioned individuals are quite specific. The first man is described as shirtless and having a cigarette, while the second man is noted to have sunglasses and a red shirt. There is no information provided that would suggest we should assume there exists a gorilla with similar characteristics. 3. The logical structure of the statement does not allow for such a conclusion to be drawn. For the statement, \\"A shirtless gorilla with a cigarette stands\\" to be a logical outcome of the original statement, there should be some relationship, implication, or indication given that would lead us to make such an assumption. In this case, there is no connection between the two men described and the mentioned gorilla. 4. The original statement is limited to observing the actions and characteristics of the two men. The actions described concern one man pointing at the other, which does not provide any basis for assuming the existence of a cigarette-holding, shirtless gorilla. In conclusion, the statement about the shirtless gorilla with a cigarette is unrelated and does not logically follow from the original statement describing the two men and their actions. One must be cautious about drawing conclusions that do not have a clear relationship or connection to the information presented. It is essential to avoid making assumptions based on unrelated or insufficient data to maintain logical and rational thinking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title: The United Nations considers a ban on all forms of cloning, a move that could eventually lead to problems for California's 10-year, 3 billion stem-cell initiative. By Kristen Philipkoski.","completion":"Title: \\"The United Nations Cloning Ban and Its Implications: A Critical Look at the Future of California's 3 Billion Stem-Cell Initiative\\" by Kristen Philipkoski. The prospect of a universal ban on cloning by the United Nations has recently come into the limelight, with the potential to create significant difficulties for California's ambitious 10-year, 3 billion stem-cell initiative. Stem-cell research has long been a controversial issue, with potential breakthroughs in medical treatments and regenerative therapies offset by ethical concerns surrounding the utilization of embryonic stem cells. Kristen Philipkoski's long-form article delves into the complex dimensions of this issue, providing a comprehensive analysis of the potential implications of a UN cloning ban on the future of California's initiative and the global scientific community engaged in stem-cell research. The article begins with an overview of the current state of stem-cell research in California, outlining the objectives of the state's 10-year stem-cell initiative and highlighting the range of scientific advancements made possible through this investment. Philipkoski emphasizes the potential of stem-cell technology in revolutionizing healthcare, with regenerative therapies, treatments for chronic diseases, and potential cures for hereditary conditions all within the realm of possibility. She also briefly touches on the ethical debates that have come hand-in-hand with embryonic stem-cell research and cloning practices, providing readers with a balanced background on the subject. Drawing from interviews with key stakeholders in the field, Philipkoski lays the groundwork for understanding the United Nations' rationale behind considering such an all-encompassing ban on cloning. She explores the moral, ethical, and cultural objections to cloning, as well as the concerns associated with human-animal chimeras and the potential risks of unregulated, commercial cloning. At the same time, she presents the counterarguments put forth by scientists and policymakers advocating for a more nuanced approach, one that differentiates between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning for medical research purposes. In doing so, Philipkoski sets the stage for a comprehensive analysis of what a complete ban on cloning might entail for the future of stem-cell research. As the crux of her piece, Philipkoski investigates the potential impact of a UN cloning ban on California's 3 billion stem-cell initiative. She discusses the legal and administrative challenges that could arise, including funding constraints, halted research projects, and the potential for a \\"brain drain\\" as scientists seek opportunities in countries with more lenient regulations. Moreover, she delves into the indirect consequences of such a ban, such as the potential stifling of innovation in the field, as well as the moral implications of abandoning scientific endeavors with life-saving potential. Lastly, Philipkoski extrapolates the potential effects of the UN's decision on the global scientific community and healthcare industry, imagining a scenario in which stricter regulations lead to slowed advancements in stem-cell therapies and medical treatment options for patients worldwide. Looking towards the future, she concludes with a call for further dialogue and balanced decision-making on the international stage to ensure that scientific progress and ethical considerations can coexist in a harmonious manner. In summary, \\"The United Nations Cloning Ban and Its Implications: A Critical Look at the Future of California's 3 Billion Stem-Cell Initiative\\" is a deeply insightful and well-researched exploration of a pressing international debate. Kristen Philipkoski navigates the ethical, legal, and scientific dimensions of stem-cell research with finesse, offering readers a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences of a UN cloning ban and the importance of continued dialogue in this complex field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Boxer and former Birmingham City and Sheffield United striker Curtis Woodhouse has caused uproar on Twitter for messages on his profile ridiculing the Oscar Pistorius trial. Now retired from football at the age of 34, a post on Woodhouse's Twitter account read: ‘5 years for shooting your mrs, I’ve got a serious decision to make’, leading to a barrage of messages both in support and criticism of the Englishman. Many in defence of Woodhouse said the Tweet was in criticism of the sentence length given to Pistorius, rather than the glamourisation of domestic violence. Boxer and former Premier League striker Curtis Woodhouse caused uproar on Twitter on Tuesday. Woodhouse played three times in the Premier League for Birmingham City in 2002-03. Woodhouse had initially wrote this tweet appearing to ridicule the sentencing of Oscar Pistorius. He then retweeted several messages discussing whether Pistorius, who was jailed for five years on Tuesday for the manslaughter of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, would play for Sheffield United on his release. This is thought to be in reference to the debate as to whether former Blades striker Ched Evans, released last week after being jailed for rape, would play for the club again. He later tweeted: ‘With oscars pace and cheds goal scoring ability I think the blades will go up this season now.’ Woodhouse also told some female followers on Twitter to ‘take your crying elsewhere please love’, ‘get kettle on’ and ‘go and burn your bra’ when they objected to his tweets.

After being held for nearly 26 years on Robben Island for planning acts of sabotage against the South African state, Mandela's release also marks what soon becomes the end of apartheid in South Africa. A new election is held, which Mandela handily wins. For his oath, he gives a speech pledging to unite the people of South Africa. The current divide has largely divided the Afrikaners (white South Africans that came from Europe during the 17th century) and the various black tribes, the largest of which include Zulu, Xhosa, and Bapedi. The effects of Mandela's victory give rise to jubilation for much of the black population of South Africa, while the white Afrikaners and Zulu begin to feel that they're losing the country. This is punctuated by a squadron of cars carrying Mandela down a road, poor black kids playing soccer on one side, white Afrikaners playing rugby on the other. The coach of the National team, the Springboks, tells his team to remember this day, as it marks 'the day the country went to the dogs'.Mandela's head of security Jason Tshabalala (Tony Kgoroge) makes a request of Mandela concerning the team. He asks for more personnel to secure the president, the current team being made up of four blacks. Mandela's response is to hire four white former Special Branch members led by Etienne Feyder (Julian Lewis Jones). On first meeting, they clash due to deep-seated racial issues, yet are compelled to work out their differences. Seeing that he has no choice but to work alongside them, Tshabalala tells his black co-workers, especially Linga Moonsamy (Patrick Mofokeng), that while working together, they will watch the whites carefully.In his first days in office, the tension is palpable, as most of the former president's underlings (mostly Afrikaners) still hold their jobs.

However, I can provide a general idea of possible outcomes. If Kendall says no to Remy's invitation for a date, she might want to do one of the following: 1. Explain her reasons for declining the date – Kendall may want to let Remy know why she's not interested in going on a date, whether it's because she doesn't see a romantic connection, or she's focused on other aspects of her life at the moment. 2. Maintain a friendship – If Kendall values her relationship with Remy but doesn't see it as a romantic one, she might want to continue being friends and spend time together in a platonic way. 3. Distance herself – If Kendall feels uncomfortable with Remy's advances, she may prefer to put some distance between them, either by limiting their interactions or spending less time together. 4. Pursue her own interests – After declining Remy's invitation, Kendall might want to focus on her own hobbies, career, or personal life, or perhaps explore other romantic options. Ultimately, what Kendall chooses to do next will depend on her personality, priorities, and feelings toward Remy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Kite Runner Movie plot: The two main characters of the story are Amir, a well-to-do Afghan boy from the dominant Pushtun ethnic group, and Hassan, the son of Amir's father's servant Ali, who belongs to the historically downtrodden Hazara minority. The boys spend their days in a peaceful Kabul, kite fighting, roaming the streets and being boys. Amir's father, Baba, loves both the boys, but seems often to favor Hassan for being more manly. He is critical of Amir. Amir's mother died in childbirth, and Amir fears his father blames him for his mother's death. However, he has a kind father figure in the form of Rahim Khan, Baba's friend, who understands Amir better, and is supportive of his interest in writing stories.A notoriously violent older boy with Nazi sympathies, Assef, blames Amir for socializing with a Hazara, who he claims is an inferior race that should only live in Hazarajat. He prepares to attack Amir, but Hassan bravely stands up to him, threatening to shoot Assef in the eye with his slingshot. Assef and his henchmen back off, but Assef says he will take revenge.Hassan is a \\"kite runner\\" for Amir: he runs to fetch kites Amir has defeated by cutting their strings. He knows where such a kite will land without even seeing it. One triumphant day, Amir wins the local tournament, and finally Baba's praise. Hassan goes to run the last cut kite (a great trophy) for Amir, saying \\"For you, a thousand times over.\\" Unfortunately, Hassan runs into Assef and his two henchmen. Hassan refuses to give up Amir's kite, so Assef exacts his revenge, assaulting and anally raping him. Wondering why Hassan is taking so long, Amir searches for Hassan and hides when he hears Assef's voice. He witnesses what happens to Hassan but is too scared to help him. Afterwards, for some time Hassan and Amir keep a distance from each other. When Hassan wants to pick up their friendship again, Amir holds it off. When people ask what is the matter, Amir reacts indifferently. He feels ashamed, and is frustrated by Hassan's saint-like behavior. Amir worries that...

Washing instructions can differ for blankets of different materials. Blankets that weigh more than 12lbs (5.5kg) should be washed in a commercial washer with the capacity for large loads. Check what your washing machine's weight capacity is too. If your blanket is too heavy for your washer's recommended load, you can take it to a laundromat or a professional laundering service with large commercial machines. If you are using a professional service, ensure the blanket is washed according to the right temperature for your blanket's fabric. Make sure you do not dry clean your blanket. Select either a cold or warm water cycle depending on the fabric. Choose the lightest wash setting, either a gentle or delicate setting on your washer. Use a gentle detergent that does not include any bleach or whitening agents. Soft fleece blankets (also called cuddle fleece or 'Minky', of a soft plush feel) should be washed in a cold water machine wash with a gentle detergent. Avoid fabric softener which can gel the short, soft fibers. Ultra-soft chenille blankets can be washed in a cold or tepid water machine cycle with gentle detergent. Poly-pellets or bead inner blankets can be washed in a warm water cycle, but avoid hot water. 100% cotton-inner blankets can use either cold or warm water alone in a delicate machine cycle with gentle detergent. Wash waterproof blankets in a warm or hot water machine wash as these can be harder to clean. Still avoid bleach or vinegar cleaning products. If you have a flannel blanket, use fabric softener in a cold or medium water cycle. Alternatively, put 1 cup of white vinegar in the rinse water.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I have a new situation: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered. But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. What is an answer for this question: What city is contributing less to global warming? The answer is:","completion":"Springfield, the city in the United States that uses nuclear power for its energy production, is contributing less to global warming when compared to Nillmar, the French city that relies on burning coal for its electricity. This conclusion can be drawn from the background information provided, which highlights the environmental issues associated with burning coal and other fossil fuels. The process of burning coal leads to the emission of greenhouse gases, air pollution, acid rain, and ultimately exacerbates global warming. On the other hand, while radioactive elements used in nuclear fission are limited and relatively rare, nuclear power does not release air pollution nor does it contribute as much to global warming as burning fossil fuels. Therefore, Springfield's decision to use nuclear power as its primary source of energy makes it a more environmentally friendly city in terms of global warming compared to Nillmar, which continues to burn coal for electricity production. Although both cities are using nonrenewable resources for their energy needs, Springfield's choice of nuclear power helps lessen its negative impact on the environment, specifically in relation to global warming."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Video is a visual medium, and while voice overs and text are great to get information across they are not incredibly compelling. If you're shooting alone you will not be able to use dialog, actors, or a ton of sound to tell your story. What you have, however, is all the time in the world to set up great shots, capture good video, and work on creating compelling angles. Have the mind of a photographer on every shot. Ask yourself if, on its own, the image is interesting. A storyboard is just the comic book version of your movie. They are invaluable ways to design your film, allowing you to \\"see\\" the movie before shooting. It then acts as your guidebook to the film. You can find and print templates online, or simply draw out your basic shots in advance with pen and paper. Improvising for the camera has it's place, of course. But storyboards are a good way to plan where the camera should go. Camera microphones are notoriously bad, and they become useless when the camera is far away from the action. An external microphone will make a huge difference in your production quality, since most audiences notice bad sound before rough video. Make discrete, compelling \\"scenes\\" instead of turning the camera on and letting it run while you move around. This ensures that you think about each scene individually and it makes editing much easier. Focus works by sharpening the image at one particularly distance from the camera. If you move around the camera will struggle to keep up, shifting focus or becoming blurry. Put down a small piece of tape that tells you where you need to sit or stand for each take. Films of any lengths are built in the editing booth.The more raw material, or film, that you have to work with the happier you will be, and the easier it will be to make a great movie. Grab different angles of the same shot, run through different lines, or videotape your environment for atmospheric shots. Every extra shot counts. Experiment with shots. Take crazy angles, get weird, abstract shots of everyday objects, and really explore your area with the camera. You may not use the footage, but even grabbing one compelling shot out of 100 will be worth it.

Gail Collins: David, as you know, I’m from Cincinnati. Some people may think of it as just another city in Ohio, but there has been a lot of drama coming out of Cincinnati over the years. One of the stars of the savings and loan scandal of the ’80s, Charles Keating, used to lecture at the Catholic girls’ high school I went to. The lectures were not about finance but rather on the sinfulness of wearing shorts in the summertime. However, my point is that stuff happens in Cincinnati. David Brooks: Have I ever mentioned the fascinating Fed study that correlated the shortness of women’s shorts with higher mortgage default rates? It was no coincidence that the vogue for Daisy Dukes immediately preceded the financial crisis. O.K., I am completely making this up. I am merely trying to deflect attention away from my main association with Cincinnati. The Big Red Machine. The best baseball team of my lifetime (Bench, Rose, Perez, Foster, Morgan, etc.), which brought me much personal pain as a Mets fan. Gail: Now my poor hometown is being castigated as the center of an I.R.S. scandal. Humble workers at the Cincinnati office targeted Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations for special scrutiny when those groups applied for tax-exempt status. There’s no conceivable excuse for that. It was deeply, deeply wrong. David: Good news. It turns out the Washington office of the I.R.S. was also deeply involved in going after conservative groups. That’s a relief. I’ve spent the last few days asking myself this question: Is it possible that a group of people were doing something completely vicious and stupid without somebody in Washington being involved? Thankfully, that matter has been resolved. Gail: Yeah, at least Cincinnati did not sin alone. It’s a pretty upright city. You’d have to figure it would need company. But Republicans quickly decided this was a plot on the part of the Obama administration, and I don’t buy that part at all. I’m not happy proclaiming that we’ve discovered a big, huge case of nonpartisan ineptitude, but that looks like the story. David: I don’t know. Tuesday’s Washington Post story makes it clear that people in Washington were pretty well aware. There are two possibilities. Either they targeted Tea Party groups because there were suddenly so many of them, and they were unaware that this might look like a politically motivated assault, in which case they are more oblivious than your average pebble, or else they targeted them for political reasons. It is not hard to believe that people in the biggest tax agency feel some animosity toward the nation’s most virulently anti-tax people. You’d have to repeal human nature for this not to be the case. Gail: I’m going for more oblivious than the average pebble. Sorry, Cincinnati. David: By the way, can I just say that I’m amazed that this I.R.S. story is bigger news than the Justice Department’s assault on The Associated Press and its reporters? I regard that intrusion as a much more egregious assault on the Constitution. I say that not just as a journalist, but because it is classic Big Brother behavior, making it impossible for journalism to function. To me this is the biggest scandal of the year, and the I.R.S. scandal is more like midlevel thuggery. Gail: I agree, and that one troubles me much, much more because unlike the I.R.S. scandal – and the raft of other alleged scandals in Washington – I do suspect that the administration was complicit in seizing the Associated Press records. This is the sort of thing it’s supported in the past. With strong Republican backing, I should add. David: Both of these matters, of course, grow out of a culture of federal arrogance. Gail: The A.P. record-poaching sprang from the mind-set that causes a president to lose all interest in the Bill of Rights once he’s responsible for protecting the nation’s security. I can understand that temptation, but the fact that even a former constitutional law professor is not immune is sort of disturbing. But about the I.R.S. — both parties have taken advantage of the current law to form huge, tax-exempt fund-raising groups that are totally political. They’re interested in the tax-exempt status mainly because it protects them from having to reveal their donors. The most famous one is Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS but the Democrats have them, too. I would argue that the Democrats started theirs only in self-defense but you can feel free to ignore that part. David: I would argue that both parties started theirs only in self-defense. In fact when Obama outraised McCain by zillions of dollars, that was self-defense too, because a pair of Martian Koch brothers could have invaded Earth at any moment and infused the G.O.P. with cash. I guess I agree that campaign finance is a mess, but when the I.R.S. starts targeting their political opponents, as they did here, I would say that is a real scandal. Gail: There are probably going to be a trillion Congressional hearings on this. It would be nice if just one committee looked at the question of overhauling those tax rules so political fund-raisers had to disclose their donors. But that’s probably too much to ask. David: There are two ways to do oversight. There’s the Henry Waxman way, when you get targets in the witness chair and you just go after them with indignation flying. Then there’s the Tom Carper way. Carper is the senator from Delaware who is chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. He gets himself deeply enmeshed in the management of his agency on a detailed basis, works hard to make sure it is decently run, and tries to head off scandal with constant minute oversight. I guess I prefer the Carper method. Gail: I don’t argue with the desirability of the method, but Homeland Security generally tends toward nonpartisan. The Republican equivalent of Henry Waxman is Oversight chairman Darrell Issa, who is just flat-out terrible. Now I’m envisioning a whole bunch of shrieking committee hearings that make it even more impossible for the I.R.S. to clamp down on political groups that disguise themselves as charities in order to let their big-bucks donors go incognito. David: If they do it even-steven, I don’t see why they should have difficulty doing that. I mean, don’t you think you would’ve reacted differently if they had targeted women’s groups or gun-control groups or environmental groups? Gail: I honestly still think I would have wanted the reforms to include the big-bucks players, which will never happen now. It’s been a depressing few weeks on the political front, and this I.R.S. thing is going to make the next few even more so. The least they could have done was to leave poor Cincinnati out of it. David. Look on the bright side. I bet they’re really happy in Akron.

With the purpose of \\"Frenchizing\\" the region, the Rot-un-Wiss has not been recognized by Paris. Some overzealous statesmen have called it a Nazi invention - while its origins date back to the XIth century and the Red and White banner of Gérard de Lorraine (aka. d'Alsace). The Rot-un-Wiss flag is still known as the real historical emblem of the region by most of the population and the departments' parliaments and has been widely used during protests against the creation of a new \\"super-region\\" gathering Champagne-Ardennes, Lorraine and Alsace, namely on Colmar's statue of liberty. What is the answer to this question: What does the \\"Union jack-like\\" flag represent?","completion":"The \\"Union jack-like\\" flag represents the union of the two départements in the Alsace region, as mentioned in the article. The flag was introduced in 1949 and is said to lack real historical relevance compared to the authentic historical Rot-un-Wiss flag. The introduction of this Union Jack-like flag seems to have been part of an effort to detract from the region's Germanic roots, a feature emphasized by the Rot-un-Wiss flag. The two départements referred to likely correspond to the administrative division in France, possibly Haut-Rhin and Bas-Rhin which make up the Alsace region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the history of IBM? I mean to ask what they were actually and how they became super giants like in today's business. Who is the owner? Who wanted to become a billionaire when they were young and actually became one? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The history of IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) dates back over a century, and it's marked by significant developments, achievements, and evolutions that have ultimately positioned it as one of the leading technology and consulting companies in the world today. Although the questions asked do not have the same meaning, I will address both independently in this detailed response. IBM's origins can be traced back to the late 19th century when several companies were formed to leverage the emerging technological advancements of the time. Key among these companies were the Tabulating Machine Company, the International Time Recording Company, and the Computing Scale Company of America. In 1911, these three companies merged to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) under the leadership of Charles Ranlett Flint. In 1914, Thomas J. Watson Sr., a former executive at the National Cash Register Company, joined CTR as general manager. He was later promoted to president in 1915. Watson significantly contributed to the success and growth of the company by instilling a strong corporate culture centered on excellent customer service and technological innovation. Under Watson's leadership, the company expanded its product offerings and started pursuing international opportunities. The company was renamed International Business Machines (IBM) in 1924, which marked the beginning of its transformation into a global technology powerhouse. By the 1930s, IBM had already established its presence in several European countries. IBM's rapid growth continued throughout the 20th century, as it made great strides in producing innovative technology. During the Second World War, IBM played a significant role in the United States' war efforts, manufacturing and maintaining some of the machinery used for information processing and communication. Additionally, IBM was instrumental in the development of early computing machines, like the Harvard Mark I in 1944 and the pioneering IBM 701 in 1952. The introduction of the IBM System/360 in 1964, a series of mainframe computers, marked a major turning point for the company. The System/360 revolutionized the industry by providing businesses and governments with a versatile and scalable computing solution. As a result, IBM solidified its position as the leader in mainframes, a market it continues to dominate today. IBM played a significant role in the development of the personal computer (PC) as well. In 1981, it launched the IBM Personal Computer, which used Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system and Intel processors. The IBM PC quickly became the standard for business, leading to IBM's domination of the PC market throughout the 1980s and '90s. Today, IBM is no longer a single-faceted company producing only computers but has diversified into multiple lines of business, which include enterprise software, IT consulting, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and cloud services. The company has also undergone various restructuring efforts over the years, including divesting from its hardware manufacturing to focus on higher-margin segments. IBM is a publicly traded company, and as such, it does not have a sole owner. It is owned by its shareholders, with its shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Regarding individuals who wished to become billionaires at a young age and succeeded, many examples exist. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, had a vision to create an internet-based bookstore and later diversified his business into the global giant it is today. Other notable examples include Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, and Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook while studying at Harvard University. Each of these entrepreneurs had dreams of significant success and achieved it through continuous innovation, tenacity, and strategic thinking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Mysterio made his World Championship Wrestling (WCW) debut on June 16, 1996, at The Great American Bash, challenging Dean Malenko for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, which Malenko retained by winning. In July at Bash at the Beach, he defeated longtime rival Psicosis in a number one contender's match to earn another opportunity at the Cruiserweight title. The next night, on the July 8 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, he defeated Malenko to win his first Cruiserweight Championship. He reigned as champion for three months, which included title defenses against the likes of Ultimate Dragon, Malenko, and Super Calo before he lost the title to Malenko at Halloween Havoc. Following his Cruiserweight Championship reign, Mysterio challenged Ultimate Dragon for the J-Crown Championship, but was unsuccessful in his title match at World War 3 in November. In early 1997, he feuded with Prince Iaukea over the WCW World Television Championship. Mysterio was defeated in his title match against Iaukea at SuperBrawl VII after Lord Steven Regal attacked him. Mysterio also lost a championship rematch at Uncensored in March. Mysterio soon began a feud with the New World Order (nWo), which culminated when he lost a Mexican Death match to nWo member Konnan at Road Wild in August. Mysterio then became involved in a feud with his real-life friend and Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero. He defeated Guerrero in a Title vs. Mask match at Halloween Havoc to win the Cruiserweight Championship for the second time. On the November 10, 1997, episode of Nitro, he lost the title back to Guerrero. They had a rematch at World War 3, which Mysterio also lost. On the January 15, 1998, episode of WCW Thunder, Mysterio defeated Juventud to win his third Cruiserweight Championship, but lost it nine days later to Chris Jericho at Souled Out. After the match, Jericho continued the beating by using a toolbox he found at ringside. This storyline was used to cover Mysterio's need for a knee operation that kept him out of the ring for six months. He made his return at Bash at the Beach, where he defeated Jericho for his fourth Cruiserweight championship. The next night, however, the result was overturned and the belt returned to Jericho due to Dean Malenko interfering. Later that year, Eddie Guerrero formed a Mexican stable known as the Latino World Order (LWO) (a spin off of New World Order) that included nearly every luchador in the promotion. Mysterio continually refused to join and feuded with Guerrero and the LWO members, including winning a match against longtime rival and LWO member Psicosis in a match at Road Wild. He was finally forced to join the group after losing a match to Eddie Guerrero. Mysterio's on-and-off tag team partner Billy Kidman joined him during the feud with LWO, wrestling against the LWO despite Mysterio being a part of the group. His alliance with Kidman was formed after Mysterio helped Kidman defeat Juventud for the Cruiserweight Championship at World War 3. Mysterio went up against Kidman for the title at Starrcade but was unsuccessful winning back the title in a triangle match that also involved Juventud. Kidman once again defeated Mysterio for the title at Souled Out in a fatal four-way match that also included Psicosis and Juventud.

The two had several rematch bouts, after which he challenged Juventud for the title, lost it to Chris Jericho at Souled Out but eventually reclaimed it after a six-month hiatus due to a knee operation. After his return, his victory was reversed due to external interference, and he later refused to join the Latino World Order formed by Guerrero, instead challenging its members in several matches. He also teamed up with Billy Kidman, aiding him in winning the Cruiserweight Championship from Juventud at the World War 3 event.

There are many ways you can do this: Carpool to work with others. Use public transportation. Consider riding the bus, using the subway, or taking a train. Plan weekly or monthly shopping trips, instead of going out whenever you need something. Buy a new bicycle, a used one, or refurbish one. While you don’t need to bicycle everywhere, you can use it to get around town, exercise, and to visit friends. In the end, you’ll save energy and gas money in addition to getting in shape. If you can't live without a car, then use it in a way that minimizes global impact. By regularly maintaining your vehicle, you’ll save money on gasoline and on future repairs. Keep your car tires adequately inflated. Under-inflated tires can reduce fuel economy by up to 9% and are subject to increased wear and tear. Check them monthly. Change your air filter. Check your car's air filter monthly. Cleaning your air filter improves your mileage and reduces pollution because it makes it easier for your car to take in air and maintain a proper fuel/air mixture. Insulate anything that uses energy to stay a different temperature from its environment. You can buy insulation from hardware stores and in many varieties. Keep your water heater insulated to save up to 1,000 lbs. of carbon dioxide a year. Avoid using units fitted with continuous pilot lights, and you will save 200 kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions yearly. Re-insulate your whole home to reduce heating and cooling costs. If your insulation is old or inefficient, replace it. Consider the attic, crawl spaces, basement, walls, and ceiling. If you have awkward spaces, be aware that cellulose or fibreglass insulation can be blown in by a professional contractor. Weather strip your home.

The reaction of the Ottoman Turks to the uprisings was disproportionate, savage and involved overwhelming force. The only hope for the insurgents was outside intervention, and that was never politically feasible. Indeed, although Bulgarian interests were favoured by the actions, the Bulgarian government itself had been required to outlaw the Macedonian rebel groups prior to the uprisings, and sought the arrest of its leaders. This was a condition of diplomacy with Russia. The waning Ottoman Empire dealt with the instability by taking vengeance on local populations that had supported the rebels. Casualties during the military campaigns themselves were comparatively small, but afterwards thousands were killed, executed or made homeless. Historian Barbara Jelavich estimates that about nine thousand homes were destroyed, and thousands of refugees were produced. According to Georgi Khadziev, 201 villages and 12,400 houses were burned, 4,694 people killed, with some 30,000 refugees fleeing to Bulgaria. On September 29, the General staff of the Uprising sent the Letter N 534 to the Bulgarian government, appealing for immediate armed intervention: Answer this question based on the article: How many more homes were destroyed during the uprising, according to Georgi Khadziev than in the estimate by historian Barbara Jelavich?","completion":"In order to answer the question, we should first determine the number of homes destroyed according to both Barbara Jelavich and Georgi Khadziev. 1.

Given the question: Two regions, region A and region B, shared a common border, a river. Region A was favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen fixing bacteria, while region B was more favorable for the developement of Non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. Which region had more sulfate reduction? Hint: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. The answer is:","completion":"Region A had more sulfate reduction. In the given situation, region A is favorable for sulfate-reducing bacteria and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, while region B is more favorable for the development of non-respiratory anaerobes and facultative anaerobes. Sulfate reduction is a process in which sulfate is reduced to hydrogen sulfide by sulfate-reducing bacteria. These bacteria need an environment containing sulfate ions in order to perform this process. Based on the information provided about the two regions, region A is the environment where sulfate-reducing bacteria can thrive due to the presence of sulfate ions. This leads to a higher level of sulfate reduction in region A compared to region B, which is more favorable for the development of other types of anaerobic bacteria that do not reduce sulfate ions."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The answer to the question: How much did the Bishop of Rochester spend on the new castle at Rochester? is inside the article: It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were..., can you guess it ?

Choices: - negentropy - binary - ordiny - entropy A: The answer is:","completion":"Entropy. Entropy is a thermodynamic property that measures the level of disorder or randomness in a system. For a dissolved substance, its entropy is higher than that of its corresponding precipitate. This is because in a dissolved state, the particles of the substance are more dispersed and have more freedom to move around. In contrast, when a substance forms a precipitate, its particles become more organized and rigidly bound together, resulting in a lower entropy. Negentropy, or negative entropy, represents the amount of order in a system, but it doesn't relate directly to the value of dissolved substances compared to their corresponding precipitates.

How do I know the AO code and AO type for a PAN card application? How do I select my AO code for new Pan Card application? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, both questions essentially have the same meaning. They are inquiring about the process of selecting the appropriate Assessing Officer (AO) code and AO type for a PAN (Permanent Account Number) card application. The AO code consists of an AO type, area code, range code, and AO number. These codes are designated by the Income Tax Department to streamline tax management and administration for applicants. Here is a detailed answer on how to know and select the appropriate AO code and AO type for a PAN card application: 1. Determine the category of the applicant First and foremost, identify the category of the applicant. The PAN card applicant may fall into one of these categories: Individual, Company, Government, HUF (Hindu Undivided Family), or any other legal entity. 2. AO type classification There are four types of AO Types: a. International Taxation - Non-Resident Indian (NRI) taxpayers who fall under this AO Type. b. Non-International Taxation - Resident Indian taxpayers fall under this category. c. Exemption - Charitable trusts, religious institutions, NGOs, etc., fall under this category. d. Foreign Companies/Entities - Companies and entities incorporated or registered outside India fall under this category. Identify the correct AO type based on the category of the applicant. 3. Search for your AO code To find the AO code, visit the official website of the Income Tax Department (https://www.incometaxindiaefiling.gov.in/home) or National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) (https://www.tin-nsdl.com/). On the NSDL website, navigate to the 'Services' tab and click on 'PAN.' Then, go to 'Know your Assessing Officer Code' or 'Know your jurisdictional Assessing Officer.' Enter the required details such as PAN number, date of birth/incorporation, and the registered mobile number. The system will display your jurisdictional AO, based on your residential or registered office address. 4. Select the appropriate area code, range code, and AO number Once you've determined the correct AO type, narrow down the area code, range code, and AO number from the list provided by the Income Tax Department. This data is categorized based on geographical regions, PIN codes, and income types. Make sure you've provided the accurate and up-to-date address information in your PAN application form. Consider factors such as whether the applicant falls under a rural or urban area, the PIN code of the applicant's residential or office address, and the type of income. If you're applying for a PAN card through a facilitation center or an online portal, the system may automatically select the appropriate AO code for you based on your address and other details provided in the application. In conclusion, both questions you've mentioned are indeed essentially the same. They are asking about the process of identifying and selecting the appropriate AO code and AO type for a PAN card application. By following the steps mentioned above, you can determine the correct AO code and AO type for your PAN card application."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kurt Vonnegut Jr. was born on November 11, 1922 in Indianapolis, Indiana. He was the youngest of three children of Kurt Vonnegut Sr. and his wife Edith (nee Lieber). His older siblings were Bernard (born 1914) and Alice (born 1917). Vonnegut was descended from German immigrants who settled in the United States in the mid-19th century; his patrilineal great-grandfather, Clemens Vonnegut of Westphalia, Germany, settled in Indianapolis and founded the Vonnegut Hardware Company. Kurt's father, and his father before him, Bernard, were architects; the architecture firm under Kurt Sr. designed such buildings as Das Deutsche Haus (now called \\"The Athenaeum\\"), the Indiana headquarters of the Bell Telephone Company, and the Fletcher Trust Building. Vonnegut's mother was born into Indianapolis high society, as her family, the Liebers, were among the wealthiest in the city, their fortune derived from ownership of a successful brewery. Although both of Vonnegut's parents were fluent German speakers, the ill feeling toward that country during and after World War I caused the Vonneguts to abandon that culture to show their American patriotism. Thus, they did not teach their youngest son German or introduce him to German literature and tradition, leaving him feeling \\"ignorant and rootless.\\" Vonnegut later credited Ida Young, his family's African-American cook and housekeeper for the first 10 years of his life, for raising him and giving him values. \\"[She] gave me decent moral instruction and was exceedingly nice to me. So she was as great an influence on me as anybody.\\" Vonnegut described Young as \\"humane and wise\\", adding that \\"the compassionate, forgiving aspects of [his] beliefs\\" came from her. The financial security and social prosperity that the Vonneguts once enjoyed were destroyed in a matter of years. The Liebers's brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of Prohibition in the United States. When the Great Depression hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.'s architectural firm to become scarce. Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in private schools, but Vonnegut was placed in a public school, called Public School No. 43, now known as the James Whitcomb Riley School. He was not bothered by this, but both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a \\"dreamy artist\\". His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said she expressed hatred \\"as corrosive as hydrochloric acid\\" for her husband. Edith Vonnegut forayed into writing and tried to sell short stories to magazines like Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post with no success.

The bizarre series of incidents has left authorities scrambling for answers and travelers in disarray as investigation progresses. Step 1: Describe the scene at the airport At around 3 AM, smoke was reported billowing from a building within the vicinity of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. Firefighters quickly arrived on the scene and discovered that the situation was much graver than initially anticipated. The flames were quickly becoming out of control, prompting airport authorities to halt all flight operations in and out of the area. Step 2: Mention the discovery of the man and his condition As firefighters were working to contain the blaze, they stumbled upon a man who appeared to have sustained several severe self-inflicted wounds. Witnesses reported seeing the man lying on the ground, bleeding profusely, and mumbling incoherently. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he is currently receiving medical attention. Authorities have yet to reveal his identity or further details about his condition. Step 3: Explain the impact on Chicago-area airports Due to the intensity of the fire, coupled with safety concerns and the ongoing investigation, all nearby airports, including both O'Hare and Midway International Airports, have temporarily halted flight operations. This sudden and unexpected disruption has caused chaos for countless passengers either attempting to leave or arrive in the Chicago metro area. Many travelers have been left stranded, frustrated and concerned over the unusual circumstances. Step 4: Discuss the ongoing investigation Authorities are now actively investigating the troubling situation and are working diligently to ascertain the root cause of the fire, as well as any potential connection with the injured man found on site. While no official statements have been made, authorities are leaning towards the possible conclusion that the man might have played a role in igniting the fire, potentially as an act of arson or an attempt to cause mass destruction. Step 5: Address the current status and future plans As investigators continue to work on the case, both O'Hare and Midway International Airports remain closed indefinitely. However, airport officials are working closely with the authorities and hope to resume flights as soon as it is deemed safe to do so. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for updated information on flight schedules and potential alternative arrangements. Conclusion: The simultaneous occurrence of a severe fire and the discovery of a man with self-inflicted wounds at the scene have sent shockwaves through the Windy City. As air travel grinds to a halt, authorities are working tirelessly to piece together these perplexing events and bring a swift resolution for the sake of the thousands of stranded travelers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Expand this summary.","completion":"In light of the recent shooting death of police officer Darren Goforth at a Texas gas station, it is not surprising that Deputy Tommi Kelley was uneasy when she was approached by a teenager at a Houston gas station in the early hours of Thursday morning. Kelley recounts that she was filling up her patrol car when 16-year-old McKinley Zoellner came up behind her. At first, she found the situation \\"kind of creepy,\\" but then the teenager surprised her by asking if he could watch her back. Zoellner explained that he wanted to do something nice for someone and show them that someone cares. He had made his mom pull into the gas station specifically because he wanted to help the officer. So, as Kelley filled up her tank, Zoellner dutifully watched her surroundings to ensure her safety. When she was done, he simply wished her a good day and started to walk away. Kelley followed him, thanked the teen, and gave him a big hug before snapping a selfie with her new friend. The photo has since been shared more than 220,000 times on Facebook. For Kelley, this encounter was a meaningful one, especially considering the recent events involving police officers. \\"It meant a lot to me, especially with everything that's been going on lately,\\" she says. \\"To be nervous having to pump gas is sickening to me. So when you have someone that is so young and mature and thoughtful, and came up to help, I was very impressed with him.\\" Zoellner, who plans to join the US Air Force after high school, hopes that his actions will inspire others to help keep police officers safe. \\"It was just amazing to see her face,\\" he says of Kelley's reaction. This incident highlights the importance of positive interactions between law enforcement officers and the public, particularly in times of heightened tensions. It serves as a reminder that simple, thoughtful acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's day and help foster a sense of community. This thoughtfulness displayed by Zoellner reflects a shift in societal attitudes towards law enforcement officers and demonstrates the power of individual acts to change perceptions and improve relationships between the police and their communities. It serves as an example for people of all ages to follow, showing that even small gestures can make a significant impact. In a broader context, encouraging and acknowledging acts of kindness towards law enforcement officers can help reduce negative stereotypes and build stronger ties between the police and the public they serve. As a society, fostering these relationships can lead to more productive conversations surrounding law enforcement issues, ultimately leading to safer communities for everyone. In conclusion, McKinley Zoellner's act of watching Deputy Tommi Kelley's back at the gas station is a simple yet powerful example of the positive impact that individuals can have on the relationships between law enforcement officers and the public. By supporting and encouraging such acts, we can work towards creating stronger, safer communities for officers and citizens alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Within the next ten years, the U. S., China, Israel, and a crowd of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon. So if and when they plant a flag, does _ give them property rights? A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative public-private working group.

Not only has this attracted an influx of skilled professionals, but it has also led to local expansion and development in areas such as housing, infrastructure, and education. Furthermore, the thriving start-up scene has attracted significant investments from both local and international corporations, further supporting the growth of innovative new businesses. As California continues to solidify itself as a global hub for technology and innovation, we can expect to see more collaborations, mergers, and business partnerships forming in the near future. However, we must also address the growing environmental concerns in California. The extended drought and increasingly dry conditions have had a significant impact on both our agriculture and water supply. This has spurred on the implementation of new conservation measures, as well as the development of innovative technologies aimed at improving water efficiency and sustainable land management. Additionally, California has been taking major steps in combating climate change. Recently, the state has set ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal power. These measures will not only protect the environment but will also stimulate the growth of the green industry, which is set to become a significant driver of the state's economy. In other news, California's vibrant cultural scene continues to prosper. Following an abundance of successful art exhibitions, film festivals, and musical gatherings, the state has further established itself as a global center for creativity and the arts. This growing focus on culture and entertainment is predicted to boost tourism, bringing in additional income and promoting economic diversity. Lastly, a focus on improving the overall quality of life for Californians has led to the development of new policies surrounding housing and transportation. With the housing market becoming increasingly competitive, the state is now working on policies aiming to make housing more affordable for middle-income families. Moreover, the expansion of public transportation networks has been prioritized to alleviate traffic congestion and encourage more environmentally-friendly modes of transportation. In conclusion, California's rapid development and continued growth have proven to be both exciting and challenging. As we move forward, the state remains dedicated to maintaining a sustainable and thriving economy, ensuring the well-being of its citizens, and addressing pressing concerns related to the environment and climate change. Thank you for your continued interest and support, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there is any additional information you would like me to provide. I look forward to keeping you updated on California's progress in the coming months.

There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs, using a condom, and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise.

Now the top US commander in Afghanistan, Gen John Allen, has been linked to another woman already tied to both Gen Petraeus and Mrs Broadwell. Who is involved in the scandal? David Petraeus' downfall is down to his liaison with Mrs Broadwell, a former military officer, academic researcher and fitness enthusiast. She graduated from the West Point military academy, then spent 15 years in the US Army as a defence policy analyst and intelligence officer in South Korea and Germany. In 2000 at Heidelberg Castle in Germany, she married Scott Broadwell, a flight surgeon (now a radiologist). They live in Charlotte, North Carolina, and have two sons. After Mrs Broadwell left the army, the family moved to Boston, where she enrolled at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. There she began a career as an academic military researcher, a path that brought her into contact with Gen Petraeus. Mrs Broadwell, now 40, met the then-lieutenant-general in 2006 when she approached him to write an academic project on his leadership style. Over the following years she went with him to Afghanistan as he took command of the Nato operation there and spent months working closely with him, before distilling her research into the glowing biography, All In: The Education of David Petraeus. A friend of Gen Petraeus has said his affair with Mrs Broadwell only began in late 2011, after he had left the military to head the CIA. In the spring of 2012, Mrs Broadwell is said to have become jealous of another woman. She allegedly sent anonymous emails to the woman, Jill Kelley, apparently warning her to stay away from Gen Petraeus. Mrs Broadwell was listed in her North Dakota high-school yearbook as \\"most likely to be remembered\\". Jill Kelley is a Tampa, Florida socialite who reportedly hails from a Catholic Lebanese family that immigrated to Philadelphia in the 1970s. Mrs Kelley, 37, and her husband Scott Kelley, a surgeon, describe themselves as having been friends with Gen Petraeus and his family for more than five years. Now Gen John Allen is under investigation after being accused of sending \\"flirtatious\\" messages to Mrs Kelley beginning in 2010. There is no suggestion that Mrs Kelley, a mother of three daughters, had an affair with either Gen Petraeus or Gen Allen. Both men wrote letters in September 2011 on behalf of Mrs Kelley's twin sister, Natalie Khawam, attesting to her good character in a messy custody dispute. A judge had earlier denied Ms Khawam custody of her young son, saying she appeared to lack honesty and integrity. In May, Mrs Kelley received threatening emails accusing her of seeking an intimate relationship with the general. FBI officials say those emails were traced to Mrs Broadwell. In Tampa, Mrs Kelley has served as an unpaid \\"social liaison\\", helping to organise gatherings at MacDill Air Force Base, which is the home of US Central Command. Since the Kelleys moved to Tampa, they have been involved in at least nine legal actions, according to court records. Most involve real estate transactions, including a home repossession and an 11,000 (Â£6,930) judgment against them in a Pennsylvania case. Gen Petraeus was stationed there before he moved to Afghanistan to run the Nato operation. Gen Allen was deputy commander there from July 2008 to June 2011. Frederick Humphries, 47, is a veteran FBI counter-terrorism agent based in Tampa, Florida, said to have triggered the investigation that led to the discovery of the extramarital affair between Gen Petraeus and Mrs Broadwell. Described by colleagues as a diligent agent, Mr Humphries is said to have been part of the team that investigated a foiled terror plot in 1999. He is a personal friend of Mrs Kelley. The two are thought to have met when Mrs Kelley attended an FBI-run \\"citizens' academy\\" in 2011, the Associated Press reports. She reported anonymous email harassment to Mr Humphries in May. But Mr Humphries was not allowed to investigate the case himself amid concerns from his superiors that he was personally involved. It has been reported that he once sent Mrs Kelley a picture of himself without a shirt on. However, Mr Humphries is said to have been persistent in his interest in the case. According to the New York Times he contacted Washington state Republican congressman Dave Reichert to voice his concerns about those apparently involved. Mr Reichert then arranged a phone call between Mr Humphries and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, whose office contacted FBI director Robert Mueller. The FBI says it was already taking the case seriously before Mr Humphries raised concerns. Whoever raised the alarm, the email trail eventually connected Jill Kelley, Paula Broadwell and David Petraeus. Natalie Khawam, said to be currently living with her twin sister and brother-in-law, is reported to be involved in a web of legal battles including a custody dispute in which Gen Petraeus and Gen Allen have intervened. The generals both submitted letters in support of her case to a judge in a Washington DC Superior Court. Gen Allen's letter, dated September this year, says he has known Ms Khawam for about three years and notes that she \\"clearly dotes\\" on her son. Ms Khawam is reportedly trained as a lawyer and was previously employed by Barry Cohen, a prominent Tampa attorney. Earlier this year she took legal action against Mr Cohen's firm, saying the company owed her money and had not acted properly on her complaints of sexual harassment with a financial officer working with them, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Holly Petraeus, Gen Petraeus' wife of 38 years, was the daughter of the general in charge of West Point when David Petraeus was a cadet there. Mrs Petraeus, who has long been an advocate for soldiers' families, has been without her husband for long periods in recent years, even testifying before the Senate about the impact of extended deployments on military spouses. In January 2011 she was hired to run a veterans' affairs office at the newly established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In that position, which was created as part of the Democrats' overhaul of financial services industry regulation, Mrs Petraeus is tasked with protecting armed services members from predatory lending practices. Mrs Petraeus' father, Gen William Knowlton, was the superintendent of West Point and Gen Petraeus was a cadet there in 1973 when the couple met. The couple have two adult children, including an army officer deployed in Afghanistan. \\"This unrelenting pace of deployments is a retention issue,\\" Mrs Petraeus said in 2003 after testifying before a Senate committee. \\"Families will not be willing to go it alone forever with little relief in sight.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article is about a scandal involving former CIA Director David Petraeus, his biographer Paula Broadwell, Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, General John Allen, and others.

Kelley, who is friends with both Petraeus and Allen, exchanged flirtatious messages with Allen, leading to an investigation of his conduct. FBI agent Frederick Humphries, linked to the case, was also found to have sent a shirtless picture of himself to Kelley.

One tiny 9-inch plant, bought for 1.25 in the spring, has already taken over much of my rose bed, covering much of other plants, and is well on its way to the front door. Roses require a good deal of care, and if it weren't for the pleasure they give, it wouldn't be worth the work. As it is, I have a garden full of sweet-smelling roses for most of the year. Bushes must be pruned in early spring, leaving ugly woody branches until the new growth appears a few weeks later. It was the space available in the garden that led me into planting just one little tomato plant. A big mistake. Soil conditions made just perfect for roses turn out be even more perfect for tomatoes. The daily watering coupled with full sun and regular fertilizing have turned the little plant into a tall bush. The cage I placed around it as the plant grew has long since disappeared under the thick leaves. Now the task I face in harvesting the fruit is twofold; First, I have to find the red ones among the leaves, which means I almost have to stand on my head, and once found I have to reach down and under, pick the tomatoes and withdraw my full fist without dropping the prize so dearly won. I found two full-blown white roses completely hidden as I picked tomatoes in June. But they were weak and the leaves already yellow for lack of light.

Review: Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) travels to Tibet and is bitten by a yeti, which causes him to become a werewolf. He is accidentally killed after he attacks his cheating wife and her lover, and is later revived by a female scientist, Dr. Ilona Ermann, who uses him in mind control experiments. Daninsky later discovers an underground asylum populated by the bizarre subjects of the doctor's failed experiments. Upon hearing of Naschy's death from colleague Jon Kitley, I rummaged through my collection for a suitable film to watch. In my scramble, I found I own not one but three(!) copies of \\"Fury of the Wolfman\\". The film is of questionable video quality, the sound is dubbed in a mediocre fashion, the cinematography is sort of slapstick style at times. And the American versions have two love scenes removed. Quite frankly, without a remastered, uncut copy, I wasn't really getting the proper movie in all its glory. This film claims to be the fourth in a long series about the werewolf Count Waldemar Daninsky. I suspect this is true, but you wouldn't know this from the film itself. The plot is confusing at times, and there's really no indication that this is a sequel. If you read the plot summaries on Wikipedia and compare them to what is printed on the box, you'll see that I'm not alone in my confusion. Perhaps the film's shortcomings can be forgiven if we understand the production hell it went through. While floating around for years, it was only released in 1973, due to problems involved in finding a distributor. And Naschy said in his autobiography that the director, Zabalza, was an incompetent alcoholic, and that he hated working with him. Those really aren't light accusations, and I have no idea what Zabalza had to say on his own behalf. Chances are, sooner or later you'll come across a low-grade version of \\"Fury of the Wolfman\\". It appears in a variety of three-packs and box sets, so you might accidentally acquire it and not even know. What really needs to happen is an American uncut version, with a decent sound and video mix, and the love scenes thrown back in. As far as I know, this does not exist.

Translate to German German:","completion":"Ich stimme dem Berichterstatter zu, dass diejenigen Mitgliedstaaten, die restriktive Regeln für die Verwendung von Phosphaten in Reinigungsmitteln umgesetzt haben, in der Lage sein müssen, diese Regeln aufrechtzuerhalten, und ich denke, es ist für uns jetzt auch auf EU-Ebene wichtig, die Frage der Phosphate anzusprechen. Phosphate sind chemische Verbindungen, die in vielen Reinigungs- und Waschmitteln sowie in Düngemitteln verwendet werden. Sie sind wichtig für das Pflanzenwachstum und waren ursprünglich eine natürliche und notwendige Ressource. Allerdings kann ihre Übernutzung zu negativen Auswirkungen für die Umwelt führen, insbesondere die Wasserverschmutzung durch Eutrophierung. Eutrophierung ist ein Prozess, bei dem übermäßige Nährstoffe, in diesem Fall Phosphate, in Gewässer gelangen, wodurch ein unnatürlich schnelles Algenwachstum gefördert wird. Das daraus resultierende Absterben der Algen führt zur Reduzierung des Sauerstoffgehalts im Wasser, was wiederum den Lebensraum vieler Wasserorganismen negativ beeinflusst und zu einem signifikanten Verlust der Artenvielfalt führen kann. Es ist entscheidend, dass sowohl auf EU-Ebene als auch auf nationaler Ebene angemessene Maßnahmen ergriffen werden, um die Verwendung von Phosphaten in Reinigungsmitteln zu regulieren und so die Umweltauswirkungen zu minimieren. Einige EU-Mitgliedstaaten haben bereits restriktive Regeln in Bezug auf die Verwendung von Phosphaten in Reinigungsmitteln eingeführt, um die Umweltbelastung zu reduzieren. Die Europäische Union hat bereits Schritte unternommen, um die Verwendung von Phosphaten in bestimmten Produkten zu regulieren. Beispielsweise wurde 2012 die Verordnung (EU) Nr. 259/2012 verabschiedet, welche die Verwendung von Phosphaten in Haushaltsreinigungsmitteln einschränkt. Diese Verordnung wird dazu beitragen, den Eintrag von Phosphaten aus Haushaltsreinigungsmitteln in die Umwelt erheblich zu reduzieren. Jedoch ist es notwendig, diese Bemühungen weiter fortzuführen und die Regulierung von Phosphaten in verschiedenen Produkten auszuweiten. Hierbei ist es wichtig, alle relevanten Interessengruppen einzubinden, wie zum Beispiel Regierungen, Hersteller, Verbraucher und Umweltschützer. Nur so kann ein ausgewogenes und ganzheitliches Verständnis der Auswirkungen sowie der besten möglichen Lösungen für die Umwelt und die Wirtschaft erreicht werden.

Jequié is rich in iron ore so that it is very hot during the day and cold at night .","completion":"Yes, the two sentences are paraphrases of each other. Paraphrasing is the act of rewriting an original text by changing the words and sentence structures to create a new representation of the original information while keeping the overall meaning intact.

However, there are a few slight differences in the sentence structures and word choices. The first difference is the use of prepositions to describe Jequié's richness in iron ore. Sentence 1 uses \\"on,\\" while Sentence 2 uses \\"in.\\" Typically, \\"rich in\\" is the correct phrase when talking about abundant resources. The second difference is in the way the sentences connect the abundance of iron ore to the climate conditions. Sentence 1 uses \\"so,\\" suggesting a cause-effect relationship or a reason. In contrast, Sentence 2 uses \\"so that,\\" which also implies cause-effect but has a slight emphasis on purpose or intention, which may not be contextually correct as the temperature can be affected by various factors, not just the bounty of iron ore. Despite these slight nuances, the overall meaning of the sentences remains the same, and hence they can be considered paraphrases.

The unsparing statement came after days of news reports that questioned whether Abramson was the victim of sexism. Allies of Abramson told The New Yorker that she had spoken up after finding out that she'd been paid less than her predecessor in the job, Bill Keller.

Answer the following question: Everybody knew Shandor Marley's mother liked to spend more time flirting with serial killers than she did taking care of things at home. So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows. He had a hand on the door before he knew for sure it was still lived-in. He flapped thunderbugs off his forearm and creaked open the door. The kitchen stank of stale cigarettes and the dregs of spirit bottles.

Henry and T.K. are working on constructing a road in rural Kerala. The start of the film focuses on the affair between Henry and his house-maid Sajani. They make love near a waterfall, witnessed by two children who flee. Both Henry and Sajani are married to different partners and both know of each other's marriages. Henry's wife Laura and son Peter return from their vacation in England. Sajani is distraught but Henry assures Sajani that she is the one he loves. Sajani's violent husband finds out about her infidelity and brutally beats her. Sajani flees to Henry's house; Henry instructs T.K. to take her away into hiding. T.K tells Sajani never to come back as she is now disgraced and her presence in the village will endanger Henry's life. Sajani does not believe T.K but leaves nonetheless. During this time, resentment towards the British grows stronger; news about an adulterous act between an Indian woman and a British man would be inflammatory. Sajani's love for Henry drives her back to Henry's house. Henry tells her to leave and admits that he does not love her.

Premise: \\"For the Ancient Egyptians, Aswan was the place where the yearly flood of the Nile began.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Aswan was the end of the yearly Nile flood.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"For the Ancient Egyptians, Aswan was the place where the yearly flood of the Nile began\\" is true, it inherently suggests that Aswan was not the end of the yearly Nile flood. To understand this assertion in more detail, let's delve into the geography of the Nile River and how its flood dynamics played a crucial role in Ancient Egyptian civilization. The Nile River, one of the world's longest rivers, flows through eastern Africa for over 6,650 km (4,130 miles) from its southernmost sources in Burundi and Rwanda, through several countries, all the way to Egypt where it ultimately drains into the Mediterranean Sea. Aswan, situated in Upper Egypt (the southern part of the country), is approximately 870 km (540 miles) upstream from the Nile Delta, where the river begins to branch into numerous smaller tributaries and finally enters the Mediterranean Sea. As the premise highlights, the Ancient Egyptians believed that Aswan was the starting point of the yearly Nile flood. This flood, also known as the \\"inundation,\\" was an essential phenomenon for Egyptian civilization because it brought nutrient-rich silt, necessary water resources, and fertile alluvial soil for agriculture. The inundation typically resulted from heavy rainfall in the Ethiopian Highlands combined with the melting of snow in the mountains. This excess water made its way downstream to Egypt and resulted in a predictable yearly flooding of the Nile River, occurring approximately between June and September. Considering this background, it becomes clear that Aswan cannot be the endpoint of the Nile flood. As the starting point of the annual flood, Aswan experienced the first effects before the inundation extended further downstream towards Lower Egypt, enriching the lands along the way. Therefore, claiming that Aswan was the end of the yearly Nile flood contradicts the given premise, as the flood continued to move northwards after it started at Aswan. Instead, the area around the Nile Delta was more likely to experience the end of the flood as waters reached the Mediterranean Sea. After reaching peak inundation levels, the floodwater would begin to recede, draining excess water and leaving behind the nutrient-rich deposits that formed the basis for Egypt's prosperous agricultural economy. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Aswan was the end of the yearly Nile flood\\" contradicts the premise, given that it asserts Aswan was the starting point of the flood. Based on our understanding of the Nile River’s geography and flood dynamics, Aswan was indeed an essential location for the Ancient Egyptians in terms of ushering in the life-sustaining flood waters, but it was not where the floodwaters ended. Rather, the flood culminated in the downstream areas closer to the Nile Delta and the Mediterranean Sea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This date was adopted at the first convention of the IFB, held in Colombo on October 4, 1969. The object of _ is to enable the general public to have a better understanding of blindness and visual handicap, and to make people more aware of the white cane as a mobility aid. Peguilly d'Herbemont was born on 25th June 1888 into an old French noble family of the same name. In her youth she led the conventional and protected existence, lack of great activity, of a girl from a \\"good family\\", an existence reminding of the life of the aristocracy before the French Revolution. She never visited a public school, but was educated by German and English governesses and nuns. Her movements were restricted and were mainly confined to the family positions in Paris and Belgium, but she spent most of her time at the castle of Charmois not far from Verdun. In the process of helping individual blind people across the road, Peguilly d'Herbemont was made aware by narrow scrapes which almost led to accidents, of the dangerous situation of the visually impaired brought about by the steadily increasing traffic on the roads. She first spoke about measures to protect the blind against street hazards to her mother in 1930, but she was of the opinion that it was unfit for a lady of good society to create a public outcry and advised her to stick to the transcription of books, a popular pastime of ladies of rank at the time. But the idea did not leave her. The urgent wish to encourage the integration of the blind into society by providing them with a means of moving about more freely without endangering others, and at the same time attracting the attention of passers-by ready to offer assistance, caused her to take the unusual step of writing to the editor of the Paris daily Echo de Paris in which she suggested issuing the blind of the Paris region with white sticks similar to...

In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu.

Given a document, generate a short title of the document. The title should convey the main idea/event/topic about which the document is being written. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Two weeks ago I reported that former Oklahoma City Police Department senior forensic analyst Elaine Taylor is the mother-in-law of Detective Rocky Gregory who co-led the investigation of former OCPD officer Daniel Holtzclaw. This information was not disclosed by police or prosecutors before during or after a biased investigation botched forensic analysis and testimony and chaotic trial that resulted in a 263-year sentence for Holtzclaw -- who has maintained his complete and actual innocence from the start and is appealing his convictions. 2) How was Taylor assigned to the Daniel Holtzclaw case on which Det. Gregory served as co-lead sex-crimes unit investigator? Smith failed to answer how Taylor was assigned to the case. He did however admit that the \\"administration of the OCPD was aware of the relationship between Elaine Taylor and Rocky Gregory.\\" Yet the administration did not disclose this relationship to Holtzclaw 's defense team which was then denied an opportunity to cross-examine Taylor and Gregory about that relationship to impeach the witnesses by uncovering potential bias and prejudice against Holtzclaw . Finally Smith glibly asserted \\"the forensic lab did not have a Holtzclaw case.\\" 1) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law Det. Rocky Gregory interrogated Holtzclaw with Det. Davis on June 18 2014 just 14 hours after Holtzclaw pulled over Jannie Ligons at an end-of-shift traffic stop. 2) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law Det. Rocky Gregory mishandled and potentially contaminated the evidence bag used to store Holtzclaw 's uniform pants -- the linchpin forensic evidence examined and tested by his mother-in-law. As forensic expert Dr. Michael Spence noted in a sworn affidavit supporting Holtzclaw 's motion for an evidentiary hearing: \\"At the June 18 2014 interrogation of Officer Holtzclaw investigators secured the uniform pants at about 6:00 p.m. At the beginning of this process video footage showed Detective Gregory placing his bare hand into the evidence bag. The detective proceeded to push on the bottom of the bag -- in order to fully open it. Officer Holtzclaw could then be seen handling his utility belt his cell phone his pockets his wallet and his keys -- (SET ITAL) all prior (END ITAL) to unclasping his belt unzipping his fly and removing his pants. In addition to the obvious DNA transfer issues associated with this order of events both the belt and the pants collected from Officer Holtzclaw were placed in (SET ITAL) one bag (END ITAL). Consequently these items were stored together transported together and remained together until the moment that the lab analyst accessed the contents of the evidence bag.\\" 3) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law Det. Rocky Gregory was present during the search of Holtzclaw 's car in the wake of Ligons' sexual assault allegation. All of the swabs taken from the car were submitted to the OCPD crime lab. In fact when Elaine Taylor called Det. Davis to ask a question about the swabs Det. Davis replied that she could not answer the questions because \\"I did not ask for those swabs to be taken.\\" 4) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law Det. Gregory was one of six participants in a meeting at the Springlake Division before Holtzclaw was taken to headquarters to be questioned about the Ligons stop. 6) After Holtzclaw 's interrogation forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law Det. Gregory accompanied Holtzclaw to his home where Det. Gregory failed to take key pieces of forensic evidence including Holtzclaw 's underwear (which Det. Gregory incorrectly assumed had been washed) and other uniforms. 7) Richard Smith's denial that the crime lab handled a \\"Holtzclaw case\\" is contradicted by the lab's own assignment of just two case numbers -- SD14-273 and SD14-399 -- for all the evidence tested. Both lab case numbers list the defendant as \\"Holtzclaw Daniel.\\" Lab case No. SD14-273 combined evidence from several accusers' allegations under that one case beginning with Ligons' allegations and including DNA from nine other accusers (Terri Morris Sherry Ellis Florene Mathis Carla Johnson Rosetta Grate Kala Lyles Regina Copeland Adaira Gardner and Syrita Bowen) as well as DNA from Holtzclaw and his then-girlfriend Kerri Hunt. 8) Forensic analyst Elaine Taylor's son-in-law Det. Gregory was one of 12 OCPD officials who executed a search warrant at 633 Culbertson Drive on Sept. 3 2014 the residence where accuser Rosetta Grate alleged Holtzclaw assaulted her and where she alleged she had left DNA evidence on the back of a chair and on a towel she claimed she left in a bedroom closet. Taylor conducted testing on evidence collected at this scene where her son-in-law who had earlier mishandled DNA evidence collection at Holtzclaw 's interrogation was present. In other words Det. Gregory and Det. Davis supervised by Lt. Muzny consolidated the forensic evidence in the Morris and Ligons cases under 14-049050 (the case number assigned to Ligons' incident) since they were both \\"related\\" to Holtzclaw . As described previously the police submitted DNA from Ligons and nine other accusers under Ligons' lab case No. SD14-273. Police incident number 14-49050 (Ligons' case) is present on many evidence documents signed by Elaine Taylor (such as chain of custody forms for accusers' buccal swabs). This means that Taylor was well aware that numerous alleged victims were involved in No. 14-049050 -- not just Jannie Ligons. In sum Det. Gregory was actively and intimately involved in the Holtzclaw investigation from day one including participating in a strategic meeting with higher-ups before Holtzclaw 's interrogation conducting the interrogation with Det. Davis overseeing the search of Holtzclaw 's vehicle and participating in the formulation of a photo lineup for accuser Ligons (which Det. Davis nixed). Det. Gregory personally collected and directly submitted DNA evidence in the Holtzclaw case to his mother-in-law and participated in a raid of a home where more DNA evidence in the Holtzclaw case was collected and submitted to his mother-in-law. Taylor's collaboration with the prosecution to emphasize that the DNA on Holtzclaw 's pants that she matched to accuser Adaira Gardner was most likely from vaginal fluid transfer \\"not only contradicted the scientific results \\" according to Dr. Spence but also \\"defied the logic that wearers typically leave DNA on their frequently used garments.\\" He further noted that the minuscule quantities of DNA mixtures found on Holtzclaw 's pants \\"were quite consistent with the expected transfer of epithelial skin cells during incidental handling events.\\" Output:","completion":"Title: Undisclosed Family Connection in Holtzclaw Case: Forensic Analyst's Relationship with Investigator Raises Questions"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Number of Americans in same-sex marriage states more than doubles A few of those are the right of inheritance, employer health benefits and a host of state tax benefits. That will not include Social Security benefits through a spouse, because that is a federal benefit. The controversial law passed by a narrow 33-to-29 vote -- a first for a GOP-led state Senate -- making New York the sixth state in the union to legalize same-sex marriage. But the decision also drew a sharp rebuke from opponents, who spent millions to try to defeat the measure. \\"We worry that both marriage and the family will be undermined by this tragic presumption of government in passing this legislation that attempts to redefine these cornerstones of civilization,\\" the state's Catholic bishops said in a joint statement released late Friday. It was signed by Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan and seven other bishops. Opponents of the marriage equality law have vowed to take political action against any Republican who voted for the bill. New York, which gave birth to the gay rights movement in the 1960s, will become the sixth state to allow same-sex marriages. Currently, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont and New Hampshire and the District of Columbia grant same-sex marriage licenses. New York state's population is 19,378,102, according to the 2010 U.S Census. The population of the other five states plus Washington equals 15,671,450: Massachusetts has 6,547,629 residents, Connecticut has 3,574,097, Iowa has 3,007,856, New Hampshire has 1,316,470, Vermont has 625,741 and Washington has 599,657. The Senate vote came after days of delays that included last-minute negotiations, passing by a slim margin with the support of four Republicans. Cuomo credited four Republican senators who joined the majority of the state's Senate Democrats for the passage of the bill -- which is to take effect in 30 days -- saying they were \\"people of courage.\\" What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the legalization of same-sex marriage in New York, which made it the sixth state in the U.S. to allow same-sex marriages.

Article: Discolorations are very recognizable when they appear. Normal lettuce is typically a light-green or yellow color, although varieties such as Red Coral have purple leaves. When the dark spots appear on multiple leaves in place of these colors, your lettuce is on its way out. Discolored lettuce often feels slimy and smells bad as well. Small brown spots usually aren’t harmful if you eat them. You can also cut around them if the rest of the lettuce leaf is still healthy. Fresh lettuce has little to no smell. You may be able to detect an earthy scent from the soil the lettuce grew in. Lettuce that smells pungent is rotting. The rotten smell will be very unpleasant, so it is easy to detect. The smell will be so off-putting that you won’t want to eat the lettuce anyway, but it is often accompanied by discoloration and slime on the leaves. Fresh lettuce is firm and crisp. As lettuce ages, it becomes soft, droopy, and wrinkled. You can spot these changes by eye or by touching the leaves. These leaves may not yet feel wet, but the lettuce is still near spoiling when it begins to wilt. Lettuce wilts right before it begins to turn brown. You will have to discard it or find a use for it right away. Wilted lettuce is safe to eat if it hasn’t begun rotting. You can try soaking it in ice water for up to 30 minutes, which may restore its crispness. In case your leaves aren’t noticeably rotten, be aware of their texture. You may be able to see moisture on the leaves as well as feel it. A sticky or slippery substance forms on the leaves as they begin to degrade, indicating softness and rot. Although wet leaves may still be safe to eat, they won’t taste very good. The leaves become soft as they wilt. You won’t be able to smell or touch the lettuce until you open the bag, but you may still see some signs of spoilage. The bag will puff up as moisture escapes the leaves. You may see beads of water collecting on the inside of the bag. Moisture creates the perfect growing spot for bacteria and mold, so don’t eat the lettuce. You may be able to see brown spots in a spoiled bag of lettuce. You can also try opening the bag. The lettuce will have that nasty, rotten smell if it has gone bad. Find a piece of lettuce that looks safe to eat and nibble on it. You are most likely familiar with the inoffensive, watery taste of fresh lettuce. Spoiled lettuce will taste the same way rotten lettuce smells. It will have a very strong, rancid, sour taste that will make you want to spit it out. Avoid eating the lettuce if it is sour.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? trashy time","completion":"The phrase \\"trashy time\\" can be interpreted differently depending on the context in which it is used and the perspective of the person hearing or reading it. When examining whether the phrase can be considered positive or negative, let's consider several factors: 1. Definition of the words: The word \\"trashy\\" typically has a negative connotation, as it is defined as something of poor quality, little value, or lacking taste or sophistication. The word \\"time\\" refers to a period or duration during which something occurs or is present. Combining these words may suggest that the time being described is characterized by poor quality or a lack of value. 2. Context: How the phrase is used in a sentence or conversation might influence the perception of whether it is positive or negative. If someone describing a fun event uses the phrase, it could be construed as a sarcastic or ironic way of saying they enjoyed the event despite its lack of sophistication. In this case, the phrase might be seen as positive. On the other hand, if the phrase is used to describe a situation where a person felt that their time was wasted or not used well, it would likely be considered negative. 3. Perspective: Different individuals may perceive the phrase differently based on their own experiences, values, and beliefs. For someone who cares a great deal about sophistication and etiquette, \\"trashy time\\" may be viewed as negative. In contrast, a person who values spontaneity and low-key experiences might see it as a positive or fun expression. 4. Intended meaning: The intention of the speaker or writer plays a significant role in determining whether a phrase is seen as positive or negative. If the person using the phrase meant it as a lighthearted joke or a playful way to describe an event that took place, it might be seen as positive. Conversely, if they meant it as an insult or a negative comment about what transpired, it would be seen as negative. In conclusion, determining whether the phrase \\"trashy time\\" is positive or negative depends on the context, perspective, and intentions of the person using the phrase, as well as the personal experiences, values, and beliefs of the person interpreting it. While the word \\"trashy\\" usually carries negative connotations, the phrase as a whole may be viewed as positive in certain situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: Who was murdered? Ames A:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the genre and time period First, we need to determine the genre of our movie. In this case, we will go with a crime thriller/mystery, as it fits perfectly with the murder plotline. The movie will be set in present day, to allow for modern forensic technology and detective methods. Step 2: Create main characters The next step is creating our main characters. We will have: Detective Smith - The lead detective on the Ames murder case, fairly experienced and well-respected in the detective community. Ames - The victim of the murder. Wealthy businessman with a complicated past and a list of potential enemies. Laura - Ames' estranged wife, a possible suspect in the case. Jacob - Ames' business partner, another potential suspect. Rachel - Ames' personal assistant, who discovers the body and appears to know more than she's letting on. Step 3: Establish the setting The movie will take place in a metropolitan city with a mix of high-end affluence and a gritty underworld. This contrast will help set the stage for the crime as well as build tension in the unfolding investigation. Step 4: Develop the plot Act 1 - Introduce the characters and murder Detective Smith is called to the crime scene, where Ames has been found dead in his luxurious apartment. It appears that Ames was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest. Smith interviews Rachel, who is visibly distraught, and gathers preliminary information about Ames. Smith contacts Laura and Jacob, who come separately to the apartment. Act 2 - Delve into the suspects and their motives Detective Smith begins to investigate the motives of Laura, Jacob, and Rachel. Laura and Ames had a tumultuous relationship and were in the middle of a contentious divorce. Jacob was struggling with the failing business partnership and had financial motive for Ames' death. Rachel is revealed to be secretly in love with Ames and harboring a terrible secret about him. The tension builds as Smith struggles to find concrete evidence pointing to any one person. Act 3 - The twist and the reveal Detective Smith discovers a hidden room in Ames' apartment, filled with incriminating materials suggesting Ames was involved in a criminal organization. Rachel, in a moment of vulnerability, confesses to Smith that she knew about Ames' illegal dealings but claims she would never have hurt him. Smith uncovers that Jacob had a secret connection to Ames' criminal past and was the one who tipped off Ames' enemies, resulting in his murder. Act 4 - The climax and resolution Detective Smith confronts Jacob with the evidence, and Jacob confesses to his role in Ames' murder. However, Laura finds out about the confrontation, and in a desperate attempt to protect her own financial interests, she kills Jacob. The movie ends with Laura's arrest and Smith's reflection on the complex world of justice, greed, and personal secrets that led to Ames' murder.

Write an article based on this summary: – A new study offers a potential way to identify comatose patients who might be \\"covertly aware.\\" University of Cambridge researchers studied the brain waves of 32 coma patients—including \\"minimally conscious\\" patients who could, say, squeeze a finger on command; \\"vegetative\\" patients who were unmoving; and 26 healthy people. The brain waves were measured with electroencephalography, and as expected, the healthy subjects' brains exhibited \\"rich and diversely connected networks.\\" Brain networks are characteristically impaired in comatose patients, but as the researchers write in PLOS Computational Biology, they also found that \\"some vegetative patients who show signs of hidden awareness have remarkably well-preserved networks similar to healthy adults.\\" As LiveScience explains, when asked to imagine playing tennis, some patients who couldn't otherwise move on command did show activity in the part of the brain tied to movement in a way that was similar to how a healthy person's brain would respond. The researchers describe the portion who did so as a \\"significant minority.\\" \\"If a patient's 'awareness' networks are intact, then we know that they are likely to be aware of what is going on around them,\\" one of the study authors tells Cambridge News. The researchers note that more work is needed before a viable diagnostic tool can be created.

A coma is when someone is like sleeping very deeply, but they can't wake up. These scientists looked at the brain waves of 32 people who were in a coma, and 26 people who were healthy. Brain waves are like invisible little messages our brain makes to help us think and do stuff. When healthy people were asked to think about playing tennis, their brain waves showed they were imagining moving just like a healthy person would. But, guess what? Some of the coma patients who could not move their body also had brain waves showing they were imagining playing tennis. This means they might be aware of what's happening around them, even though they cannot show it. The scientists say they need to do more experiments before they can make a special tool to check if coma patients can really understand what's happening. This study is important because it can help doctors and family members know if a person in a coma is still able to think, even if they cannot move or talk."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No. The information provided in the scenario involves Austin riding a bike on a beautiful mountain range, which implies that he is engaging in an outdoor physical activity. This activity requires a certain level of physical fitness and effort, suggesting that Austin might enjoy staying active and challenging himself. Considering these factors, it would not be accurate to describe Austin as \\"lazy.\\" Lazy can be defined as a reluctance to work or engage in regular activities that demand physical or mental effort. It is often characterized by a preference for rest or idleness, as well as a lack of motivation to engage in various tasks. Riding a bike, particularly along a mountain range, involves considerable physical exertion and willpower, demonstrating that Austin is participating in a demanding exercise that enhances his overall health and wellbeing. Moreover, mountain biking represents an adventurous and thrilling activity, which can also reflect Austin's possible inclination towards outdoor pursuits and his desire to explore nature. This further supports the notion that he is not lazy but rather an energetic individual who enjoys a diverse range of leisure and recreational activities. Additionally, it is important to note that with the limited information provided in the scenario, we cannot accurately judge Austin's overall behavior or assess his personality traits. Labeling him as lazy based on a single instance would be an unfair and unsuitable assumption. In summary, considering Austin's active engagement in mountain biking and the limited information available, it would not be valid to describe him as lazy. Instead, we could infer that he is likely to be an active and adventurous person who appreciates the outdoors and strives to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Web search provider Google Inc., posting its first financial results as a public company, yesterday said its third-quarter earnings and revenues both more than doubled from a year ago on the strength of an online advertising boom that continues to gather steam.","completion":"This is about the financial results announced by web search provider Google Inc. after its initial public offering (IPO) as a public company. When posting its financial figures for the third quarter, Google revealed that its earnings and revenues had more than doubled compared to the same period a year ago, highlighting the significant success and growth of the company during this time. This considerable growth can be attributed to various factors, the most influential of which was the burgeoning online advertising boom during the early 2000s. The rapid expansion of internet adoption and increased use of search engines paved the way for higher advertisement placements on Google's platform. At the core of Google's success during this period was its pioneering technology focusing on targeted advertising. This enabled the search engine to display relevant advertisements for each user's specific search query, which ultimately resulted in higher click-through rates and ad revenue for both the advertisers and Google. The newly launched Google AdWords was instrumental in this process, further propelling the company's financial success. Google's soaring financial results post-IPO also attracted investor attention and displayed the strength of the internet advertising market, proving that the online advertising model was sustainable and profitable. This provided a strong foundation for the company's future growth in other areas, such as the development of its technologies and the acquisition of new online services and platforms. Additionally, Google's public listing underscored the company's ability to raise capital and further expand their services and technologies. This financial success reinforced Google's position as a dominant player and laid the groundwork for subsequent diversification, including the introduction of Google Maps, Google Drive, AdSense, Android, and YouTube, among many others. In conclusion, the information provided is about the impressive financial results posted by Google Inc. during its first quarter as a public company. Both earnings and revenues saw significant growth thanks to the booming online advertising landscape during the early 2000s. Such a surge in finances demonstrated the effectiveness of targeted online advertising and allowed Google to expand and dominate the market for years to come, setting the stage for the tech giant we know today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Two sister countries used petroleum in different ways. Norway used it to make plastics, while Sweden used it for fuel. But I can use this background: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward.

If um i guess i'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second, can we conclude that \\"Since I'm wearing armor, I don't need to worry about my privacy.\\"?","completion":"There are several factors to consider when evaluating the statement, \\"Since I'm wearing armor, I don't need to worry about my privacy.\\" First, let's break down the components of this statement: 1. Wearing armor 2. Not feeling invaded in privacy 3. Not worrying about privacy Wearing armor, in general, refers to having a layer of physical or metaphorical protection against possible harm. In today's world, this could mean having strong security measures in place, such as firewalls, anti-virus software, strong passwords, and secure networks, or practicing safe browsing habits to protect one's digital life. Armor can also refer to maintaining boundaries in social settings to prevent invasive interactions. A feeling of privacy relates to the level of control individuals have over their personal information and actions. Privacy is about determining when, how, and to what extent information about oneself is communicated to others. Not worrying about privacy implies that one feels secure in their control over the flow of information related to themselves. With these components in mind, let's examine the validity of the statement. The connection between wearing armor and not feeling invaded in privacy is certainly valid to an extent. For example, having strong security measures in place can provide an individual with a sense of control over their personal information, which could make them feel less concerned about potential privacy breaches. However, this feeling of security can be both beneficial and dangerous. While having adequate protection can be an essential measure to safeguard one's privacy, it is also crucial not to rely solely on these measures for privacy protection. This is because, although security measures can be highly effective, they are not foolproof, and risk still remains. One reason for this is that technology is continually evolving, with new threats and vulnerabilities being regularly discovered. As a result, staying vigilant about privacy is essential, even when wearing metaphorical armor. Furthermore, external factors, such as changes in laws and regulations, can also impact one's level of privacy, regardless of the security measures they have in place. Moreover, it's critical to consider the human factor in protecting one's privacy. Even if someone has the strongest armor, they could inadvertently or intentionally compromise their privacy by sharing personal information with untrusted third parties or engaging in risky online behavior. In conclusion, while wearing armor can offer a level of protection and increase the feeling of control over one's privacy, it should not be seen as an all-encompassing solution. Instead, it's essential to combine security measures with continuous vigilance and responsible behavior to maintain privacy effectively. Individuals should be aware of the ongoing nature of privacy maintenance and balance trust in their protective measures with a healthy dose of caution."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At the beginning of 1664, the Imperial Army was divided into three corps: In the south, 17,000 Hungarian-Croatian troops under the command of Nikola Zrinski. In the center, the main army of Montecuccoli, which was 28,500 men strong, and in the north some 8,500 men under General Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches. There were some 12,500 men in reserve to defend the fortresses. This army of 66,500 men was not united, as the differences of opinion between the commanders were very strong, especially with Zrinski. As a preparation for campaigns planned for 1664, Zrinski set out to destroy the strongly fortified Ottoman bridge bridge) which, since 1566, had linked Darda to Osijek across the Drava and the marshes of Baranya. Destruction of the bridge would cut off the retreat of the Ottoman Army and make any Turkish reinforcement impossible for several months. Re-capturing strong fortresses on his way, Zrinski advanced 240 kilometers on enemy territory and destroyed the bridge on February 1, 1664. He didn't succeed in conquering Nagykanizsa, the main objective. The siege had to be lifted when in June the main army of Köprülü approached. The Turks besieged and conquered Zrinski's stronghold Novi Zrin, which had to be abandoned when Montecuccoli refused to come to its rescue. Zrinski would never forgive this, which would eventually lead to the Magnate conspiracy in Croatia, and \\"Wesselényi conspiracy\\" in Hungary).

This statement discusses the full aperture can technology developed for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and has no relation to light damaging beer not in a can. The phenomenon you are asking about is known as \\"lightstruck\\" or \\"skunked\\" beer. When beer is exposed to sunlight or artificial light sources, such as fluorescent lights, certain wavelengths of light can penetrate the beer and trigger a photochemical reaction. This reaction involves the breakdown of iso-alpha-acids – which are formed during brewing when hops are added to beer – and the subsequent production of molecules called \\"3-methyl-2-butene-1-thiol,\\" or MBT. MBT is chemically similar to the odor-producing compounds found in a skunk's spray, hence the term \\"skunked.\\" When beer is exposed to light for extended periods, the photochemical reaction can rapidly progress and produce a noticeable change in the beer's flavor and aroma. This change is generally undesirable and can significantly impair the quality of the beer. Lightstruck beer may taste stale, off, or skunky, making for an unpleasant drinking experience. To prevent beer from becoming lightstruck or skunked, breweries often use amber or brown glass bottles, which block much of the damaging light wavelengths. Additionally, cans – such as the full aperture can mentioned in the original statement – provide excellent protection against light damage because they block all light from reaching the beer. This is one of the reasons why cans are gaining popularity for packaging beer, as they offer better protection against lightstruck damage compared to clear or green glass bottles. In summary, the term for light damaging beer that is not in a can is called \\"lightstruck\\" or \\"skunked\\" beer, resulting from a photochemical reaction that affects the beer's flavor and aroma. The statement about the full aperture can technology does not address this phenomenon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Terracotta Army is considered one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century. It is a part of the mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, who was the founder of the Qin Dynasty and united China under a centralized government for the first time in its history. The construction of his mausoleum began in 246 BC when Qin Shi Huang ascended the throne. As per the historical records, it took around 38 years and an estimated 700,000 workers to complete the project. The Terracotta Army consists of more than 8,000 life-sized terracotta sculptures of soldiers, chariots, and horses, which were meant to accompany the emperor into the afterlife and protect him from any potential dangers. The statues are arranged in battle formations, and each soldier has unique and intricate facial features, hairstyles, and armor, showcasing the incredible craftsmanship of the sculptors of that time. In addition to the warriors, other terracotta figures like acrobats, strongmen, and musicians were also discovered, depicting various aspects of life during the Qin Dynasty. These additional figures provide valuable insights into the social and cultural aspects of that era. Since the discovery of the Terracotta Army, extensive excavations and research have been conducted to learn more about the historical context and purpose of this immense funerary art. The mausoleum complex is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors every year to explore this fascinating window into ancient China and its rich history. In conclusion, the Terracotta Army is an astonishing archaeological discovery that showcases the skills of ancient Chinese artisans and offers a unique perspective into the life, beliefs, and history of the Qin Dynasty. This invaluable collection of statues- warriors, chariots, horses, officials, acrobats, strongmen and musicians- continues to captivate the world with its remarkable detail, scale, and cultural significance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. I am facing a new situation today: Jacob is an avid street car racer who is driving in his sleek black Mustang.

Like it or not, you will be judged by your personal appearance. This is never more apparent than on _ , when what you wear can say more about you than any business suit ever could. In fact, people will pay more attention to what you wear on dress-down days than on \\"business professional\\" days. Thus, when dressing in \\"business casual\\" clothes, try to put some good taste into your wardrobe choices, and recognize that the \\"real\\" definition of business casual is to dress just one notch down from what you would normally wear of business-professional attire days. Remember, there are borders between your career and our social life. You should dress one way for play and another way when you mean business. Always ask yourself where you are going and how other people will be dressed when you get there. Is the final destination the opera, the beach, or the office? Dress properly and you will discover the truth in the principle that clothes make the man--and the...

Movie plot title: The Mexican Movie plot: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival. Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck. Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank (Michael Cerveris), who then has a relationship with Leroy.

Article:Britain's two best tennis stars will be taking to the court - that is the men's world number one Andy Murray and women's British number one Johanna Konta. Andy Murray's older brother Jamie will also be battling it out on the doubles court, with his partner Brazilian Bruno Soares. But who are the ten other British tennis talents that we know will be joining the Murray brothers and Konta on court next week? The 22-year-old, who became a professional tennis player five years ago, qualified for Wimbledon automatically as he is ranked inside the world's top 100. When he played Novak Djokovic in March 2016 in the Miami Masters, Djokovic - who was the world number one at the time - said that Edmund could get to the top of the men's game. He has played in Wimbledon four times before, both in the singles and doubles tournament, but has not got past the first round. Can he do it this year? Like Kyle Edmund, Aljaz Bedene qualified automatically too. The 27-year-old was born in Slovenia, but became a British citizen in 2015. He has also played in Wimbledon four times before, in both the singles and doubles tournaments. However, two years ago, he got through to the singles second round. We will have to wait to see if he can do it again - or go even further - this year. Naomi, along with the next six players in this list, was given a wild card for Wimbledon this year, which means she didn't qualify automatically. The 27-year-old is not quite in the world's top 100 players, but is hoping to get there in time for the US Open later this year. She has played in Wimbledon six times before, and even made it through to the third round in the doubles tournament last year. Can she match that success in her singles game in 2017? Heather Watson used to be the women's British number one, but she has had a difficult season, and is currently outside of the top 100 in the world. The 25-year-old has a total of seven years of Wimbledon appearances behind her. Only three players on this list of less-known British players have played in the tournament this many times. Last year, she won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title with her partner Finn Henri Kontinen, which she told Newsround was \\"a dream come true\\". Will dreams come true over the next fortnight? Well, she has played well in the Wimbledon warm-up tournament. \\"I've been working really hard these last couple of months and have been waiting for the results to start coming and it's nice they've started coming here at home on grass,\\" she said. Like Heather Watson, the 23-year old has been British number one in the past and has also appeared in seven Wimbledon tournaments. Robson even got as far as the 4th round in 2013. In that same year, she reached the 3rd round of the US Open and the Australian Open, but Robson has not matched this success over the last four years. She didn't have much luck in Wimbledon last year as she was drawn against the Australian Open champion at the time, Angelique Kerber, in the very first round. She was beaten 6-2, 6-2. We will have to see on Friday whether or not she will have an easier match to begin with this year! Having only reached the second round of qualifying at Wimbledon last year, Katie Boulter will be playing in the main Wimbledon draw for the first time in her career. The 20-year-old, who was in the top 10 players in the world as a junior player, has said she will \\"cherish\\" the experience. With no grand slam singles or doubles results to her name, it will be interesting to watch how this young player gets on. \\"I am looking forward to playing and thankful to get the opportunity to test my skills against higher-ranked players,\\" she said. Australia-born Brydan Klein, who has represented Great Britain since 2013, is another wild entry into the main draw for Wimbledon this year. Like Kyle Edmund, he has never made it past the first round in either of the last two years when he has played in the tournament. He did make it to the second round of the Australian Open in 2009, but has not had much success in grand slams since. Will 2017 at Wimbledon be his year? Like Katie Boulter, 21-year-old Cameron Norrie has no grand slam results to his name. He is currently studying sociology over in America, but has put his studies on hold to come over to compete at Wimbledon. Just this week, Norrie got his first victory over a top 50 player by defeating Argentina's Horacio Zeballos in Eastbourne, which is a good start. But time will tell whether or not he can secure any more career-changing wins over the next fortnight... Like Laura Robson, James Ward didn't have an easy first round at Wimbledon last year when he found himself coming up against top seed Novak Djokovic. He was beaten 6-0, 7-6, 6-4. The 30-year-old has played in the tournament seven times before in both singles and doubles, with his best result being getting to the third round of the singles game in 2015. We bet he's crossing his fingers right now for a better draw on Friday than last year! Alex Ward, who is ranked 855 in the world, is the only British player who has come through the Wimbledon singles qualifiers. This will be the second time he has played in the main draw at Wimbledon, after he received a wild card entry last year. \\"It will mean everything [to return to Wimbledon], especially having qualified. I feel like I really deserve my place there,\\" he said. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The article highlights 13 British tennis players who are set to make an impact in the upcoming Wimbledon tennis tournament.

The LAPD is currently on the lookout for the suspect, who should not be too hard to find, given his unique attire and recent injuries. According to the LA Times, the incident began when the unidentified man in a Lakers uniform approached the security guard and asked for directions. After engaging in this brief conversation, the man suddenly pulled out an assault pistol and ordered the guard to get down on the ground. Fearing for his life, the security guard complied and handed over his wallet when demanded by the assailant. However, the situation took an unexpected turn when the mugger, in his haste to make off with the wallet, took a moment to check the contents for cash. Seizing this opportunity, the security guard turned the tables by grabbing the gun from the unsuspecting perpetrator and striking him in the head with a heavy flashlight he had on hand. LAist reports that the blow to the head left the assailant dazed, giving the guard enough time to take control of the situation. In the confusion that ensued, the Lakers-clad mugger managed to escape from the scene of the crime, but not before leaving behind a significant amount of blood from his injuries. Police are now following this trail of evidence, working to identify the suspect using fingerprints left on the gun and DNA collected from the blood. In the meantime, they are also asking for the public's help in locating the suspect. An LAPD spokesperson commented on the case, stating, \\"We'll try to identify the suspect by prints off the gun and DNA from his blood. In the meantime, maybe someone remembers seeing a guy in a bloody Lakers uniform with a gash on his head.\\" This unusual crime has generated a buzz in Los Angeles, as both Lakers fans and non-fans alike are baffled by the perpetrator's choice of outfit for such a bold attempt at robbery. While the circumstances surrounding the crime remain somewhat unclear, the security guard's quick thinking may serve as a lesson to would-be criminals considering following in the Lakers-clad mugger's footsteps. As the search for the suspect continues, we can only hope that he is brought to justice soon. Until then, the people of Los Angeles will no doubt be casting a wary glance at anyone donning a Lakers uniform in the near future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The C.I.A. made the assessment based on the crown prince’s control of Saudi Arabia, which is such that the killing would not have taken place without his approval, and has buttressed its conclusion with two sets of crucial communications: intercepts of the crown prince’s calls in the days before the killing, and calls by the kill team to a senior aide to the crown prince. The C.I.A. has believed for weeks that Prince Mohammed was culpable in Mr. Khashoggi’s killing but had been hesitant to definitively conclude that he directly ordered it. The agency has passed that assessment on to lawmakers and Trump administration officials. The change in C.I.A. thinking came as new information emerged, officials said. The evidence included an intercept showing a member of the kill team calling an aide to Prince Mohammed and saying “tell your boss” that the mission was accomplished. Officials cautioned, however, that the new information is not direct evidence linking Prince Mohammed to the assassination, which was carried out in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the US, Prince Khalid bin Salman, has denied telling journalist Jamal Khashoggi to go to Turkey and requested the US government release information related to the claim made by a US newspaper.

Step 2: Compare possible answers with context Now we can compare the possible answers provided with the context of the sentence: 1. Did this to dance: There's no explicit mention of dancing in the sentence, only the action of shaking a leg, which could be interpreted as a dance move, but given the presence of the spider, it's less likely to be the reason. 2. Squish the spider: No mention of Jan trying to kill or squish the spider, only that it fell on the ground. 3. Did this out of fear: Jan's action caused the spider to fall, which implies that Jan's action was a reaction to the presence of the spider. This answer seems more plausible given the context.

Article: North Korea workers fail to turn up at Kaesong More than 120 South Korean firms operate at Kaesong Industrial Complex North Koreans have failed to report for work at Kaesong Industrial Complex, suspending one of the few points of co-operation between the Koreas. The complex is a joint industrial park and there are more than 120 South Korean companies that operate there, employing 53,000 North Korean workers. It is seen as a crucial source of hard currency for North Korea. The move is the latest in a series of provocations that have raised tensions in the Korean peninsula and the region. \\"As of now, no North Korean workers have reported to work this morning,\\" a spokesperson for the South Korean Unification Ministry said. The ministry added that 77 South Korean workers would leave the zone on Tuesday, but 479 were still inside Kaesong. Investment risk The complex was launched in 2003 and was largely funded by South Korea. Seoul has said the purpose of the complex was to develop a joint industrial park where South Korean companies could manufacture their products using North Korean labour. It said that would help North Korea start to reform its economy, which is in a dire state, and ease tensions between the two Koreas. South Korea has given incentives to companies to try and encourage them to set up operations there. These include political risk insurance to cover losses in their investment. As a result, if the project is threatened, South Korea also tends to lose. South Korean President Park Geun-hye said the boycott by North Korea would harm the country's credibility. \\"Investment is all about being able to anticipate results and trust and when you have the North breaking international regulations and promises like this and suspending Kaesong while the world is watching, no country in the world will invest in the North,\\" she told a cabinet meeting in Seoul. Last symbol \\"I don't know what to do, honestly. I can't simply tell my workers to leave or stay,\\" an executive from a South Korean clothing firm told the Reuters news agency.

South Korean companies pay more than 80m (£52m) a year in salaries. As a whole, the Kaesong complex produced 470m worth of goods last year. It accounts for nearly all inter-Korean trade. The BBC's Lucy Williamson, reporting from Seoul, said that for almost a decade the joint industrial zone has chugged on, through North Korean nuclear tests, rhetoric, and even military clashes with the South. But now the last symbol of joint inter-Korean co-operation is effectively suspended, she says. North Korea has blocked access to South Koreans working there since Wednesday. Tough sanctions On Monday it said it would withdraw all its own employees and suspend operations in the zone. A decision would come later on whether it would shut it down for good. North Korea has expressed anger at South Korean media reports that the North would not shut down Kaesong because its struggling economy is heavily dependent on the complex. The United Nations imposed tough sanctions on North Korea last month following its third nuclear test. Pyongyang has responded to this and to joint military exercises between South Korea and the US with escalating rhetoric. It has threatened to use nuclear weapons and said it would restart a nuclear reactor. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. The North has also shut down an emergency military hotline between Seoul and Pyongyang. Last week, it warned it would not be able to guarantee the safety of foreign embassy staff after 10 April, and that countries should begin evacuating their diplomatic staff. Over the weekend, the US cancelled a scheduled test of its Minuteman 3 ballistic missile, citing concerns that it could be misinterpreted by Pyongyang. Meanwhile, Japan said it has deployed US-made Patriot anti-missile batteries in Tokyo and other parts of the country to guard against North Korea launching ballistic missiles. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the government was \\"fully prepared to protect the lives and safety of the Japanese people\\". \\"North Korea is still continuing its provocative actions towards the international community, but we must take measures in a calm manner by cooperating with other nations,\\" Mr Abe said. \\"In particular, we believe it is necessary to implement the latest sanctions resolution by the UN.\\" No one here in Japan thinks Pyongyang is really preparing to attack Japan, says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo. But it may try to fire a missile over the top of Japan in to the Pacific Ocean, and if it does, Tokyo has made it clear it will shoot the missile down, our correspondent adds. ||||| SEOUL North Korea intensified threats of an imminent conflict against the United States and the South on Tuesday, warning foreigners to evacuate South Korea to avoid being dragged into \\"thermonuclear war\\". The North's latest message belied an atmosphere free of anxiety in the South Korean capital, where the city center was bustling with traffic and offices operated normally. Pyongyang has shown no sign of preparing its 1.2 million-strong army for war, indicating the threat could be aimed partly at bolstering Kim Jong-un, 30, the third in his family to lead the country. The North, which threatens the United States and its \\"puppet\\", South Korea, on a daily basis, is marking anniversaries this week that could be accompanied by strong statements or military displays. The warning to foreigners in the South, reported by the KCNA news agency, said once war broke out \\"it will be an all-out war, a merciless, sacred, retaliatory war to be waged by (North Korea). \\"It does not want to see foreigners in South Korea fall victim to the war,\\" the agency quoted the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee as saying. \\"The committee informs all foreign institutions and enterprises and foreigners, including tourists...that they are requested to take measures for shelter and evacuation in advance for their safety.\\" None of the embassies in Seoul appeared to have issued any directives to their nationals and airlines reported no changes in their schedules. Schools catering to foreign pupils worked without interruption. The warning, read out on North Korea's state television in a bulletin that interrupted normal programming, was the latest threat in weeks of high tension following U.N. sanctions slapped on Pyongyang for its latest nuclear arms test. It followed the North's suspension of activity at the Kaesong joint industrial park just inside North Korea, all but closing down the last remnant of cooperation between the neighbors. North Korean workers failed to turn up on Tuesday. North Korea had said South Korea was trying to turn the Kaesong complex into a \\"hotbed of war\\". Speculation remained high that the North may launch some provocative action this week - perhaps a missile launch or a nuclear arms test. In a previous appeal, its authorities urged diplomats in Pyongyang to leave on grounds their safety could not be assured beyond Wednesday. None appeared to have taken any such action. \\"VERY DANGEROUS\\" SITUATION Also featured in broadcasts were country-wide reports of celebrations marking Saturday's 20th anniversary of the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il, taking over North Korea's leadership and next Monday's birth date of his grandfather, post-World War Two state founder Kim Il-Sung. A spokeswoman for South Korea's presidential Blue House dismissed the warning, saying no one felt under threat. \\"We understand that not only South Koreans, but also foreigners residing here remain unfazed as they have great trust and confidence in our military and the Republic of Korea,\\" Yonhap news agency quoted Kim Haing as saying. She was referring to South Korea by its official name. A government source in Seoul said a North Korean medium-range missile, reported to have been shunted to the east coast, had been tracked and was believed to be ready for launch. \\"Technically, they can launch it as early as tomorrow,\\" the source said. But a U.S. embassy official in Seoul said a directive issued last week saying there was no imminent threat to Americans in South Korea remained valid. \\"Our workers are in all our offices today,\\" he said. \\"We have not evacuated anyone.\\" Stocks, which had fallen 4 percent over the past four days, edged higher on Tuesday despite the warning. The won currency moved little, dipping slightly after the North Korean statement. World leaders have expressed alarm at the crisis and the prospect of a conflict involving a country claiming to be developing nuclear weapons. China, the North's sole diplomatic and financial ally, issued a new call for calm and restraint, though Beijing's leaders have shown increasing impatience with Pyongyang. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman, in a statement on the ministry's website, said Moscow was in solidarity with all G8 industrialized countries \\"as regards the rejection of Pyongyang's current provocative and bellicose line of conduct\\". An official from the 27-nation European Union said Pyongyang \\"looks calm\\", but acknowledged there was a \\"limited risk...of an armed conflict\\". U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, speaking in Rome, described the situation as \\"very dangerous. A small incident caused by miscalculation or misjudgment may create an uncontrollable situation\\". The North is also angry at weeks of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises off the coast of the peninsula, with B-2 stealth bombers dispatched from their U.S. bases. But the United States announced the postponement last weekend of a long-planned missile launch, a move officials said was aimed at easing tensions on the peninsula. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visits Seoul this week. Employers at the Kaesong complex faced uncertainty as the 53,000-strong North Korean workforce stayed away. A spokesman for textile company Taekwang Industrial and at least two other firms said production had stopped. South Korean figures said 406 South Koreans remained in Kaesong on Tuesday after 69 left the complex, which generates 2 billion in trade for the impoverished North. Addressing a cabinet meeting, South Korean President Park Geun-hye described the suspension of Kaesong as \\"very disappointing\\" and said investors would now shun the North. South Korean companies are estimated to have invested around 500 million in the park since 2004. North Korean workers at the park have appeared increasingly agitated in recent days, refusing to talk to their colleagues. Many Southerners connected with the park bedded down at budget hotels in a nearby South Korean town in the hope that an order would come from the North to re-open.

If the tip is plastic, you will ingest toxic fumes from the burning of plastic.","completion":"Step 1: Disassemble the pen First, twist or pull apart the pen to remove its components, including the ink cartridge, the spring, and the pen's outer casing. Make sure you do this carefully to avoid damaging the pen or hurting yourself. Step 2: Clean the pen components Wipe away any ink residue from the pen's components, particularly the metal tip and the outer casing, using a cloth or paper towel. You may also run the metal tip under water to remove any remaining ink. Step 3: Reassemble the pen without the ink cartridge Put the spring back into the outer casing of the pen, ensuring that it remains in place at the bottom. Then, insert the metal tip back into the casing. Make sure the spring and the metal tip fit snugly against each other within the casing. The pen should now resemble a pipe with a hollow tube and a metal bowl. Step 4: Test the airflow Check the airflow through the pipe by blowing through the end opposite the metal tip. There should be enough airflow to draw smoke, but not too much that it feels excessively loose. Step 5: Load the pipe with pipe tobacco Place a small amount of pipe tobacco into the metal tip – this is now the bowl of your pipe.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What label does Camus reject?\\" is \\"Rebellion\\"?","completion":"According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What label does Camus reject?\\" is \\"Existentialist.\\" Camus specifically rejected the label of Existentialist in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere in his works.

Açıklama (the statement) is like someone talking or saying something important. Bazı Bulgar politikacılar (some Bulgarian politicians) are people who make choices and rules in Bulgaria. Öfkeyle (with indignation) means that they are not happy or they are upset about what someone said. Karşılandı (was met) means it's how those people took or accepted what that someone said. So, the whole sentence means that some people who make decisions in Bulgaria were not happy about what someone said."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Why did people immigrate to Portugal?\\" is in \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.

Read this: In Arthurian legend, Avalon became associated with Glastonbury Tor when monks at Glastonbury Abbey claimed to have discovered the bones of King Arthur and his queen. What is more certain is that Glastonbury was an important religious centre by 700 and claims to be \\"the oldest above-ground Christian church in the World\\" situated \\"in the mystical land of Avalon.\\" The claim is based on dating the founding of the community of monks at AD 63, the year of the legendary visit of Joseph of Arimathea, who was supposed to have brought the Holy Grail. During the Middle Ages there were also important religious sites at Woodspring Priory and Muchelney Abbey. The present Diocese of Bath and Wells covers Somerset – with the exception of the Parish of Abbots Leigh with Leigh Woods in North Somerset – and a small area of Dorset. The Episcopal seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells is now in the Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew in the city of Wells, having previously been at Bath Abbey. Before the English Reformation, it was a Roman Catholic diocese; the county now falls within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton.

Let's break down each sentence to understand their meanings better. 1. The following step works as follows: as long as there are three or more wires with the same weight, add a second shift.

If the condition is met, the action to be taken is to \\"add a second shift.\\" The term \\"second shift\\" is somewhat vague in this context, but it seems to refer to an additional shift or change in the process. 2.

However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building.

Although the given information, \\"Interesting rock formations in the desert landscape, with stars above,\\" suggests a clear view of the stars, it does not provide us with sufficient data to draw a definitive conclusion about the presence or absence of clouds in the night sky. Assuming that the rock formations are in a desert landscape, we can infer that the geographical location has a generally dry and arid climate, which usually results in fewer clouds compared to wetter or more temperate regions. However, even deserts can have occasional cloud cover at night, and this may not obscure all the stars in the sky. Furthermore, the phrase \\"with stars above\\" implies that stars are visible, but it does not clarify whether all or only certain sections of the sky are filled with stars. It is possible that clouds could be present in other areas of the sky, not directly above the rock formations, but still not obstructing the view of certain stars. In summary, while the given information suggests that some stars are visible in the night sky above the rock formations in the desert landscape, it is not possible to tell if there are no clouds in the night sky based solely on this statement.

The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States. After 37 years of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that they would embark on their final world tour, which began that May and is estimated to wrap up in 2019 or 2020.

Let's solve the math problem step by step. We have: 10*f + 364 = 117*f - 64 We need to find the value of \\"f\\". First, let's move all the \\"f\\" terms to one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract \\"10*f\\" from both sides: 364 = 117*f - 10*f - 64 Now, let's simplify it by doing 117*f - 10*f which is equal to 107*f: 364 = 107*f - 64 Next, we need to get rid of the \\"-64\\" on the right side of the equation. To do this, we can add \\"64\\" to both sides: 364 + 64 = 107*f When we add 364 and 64, we get 428: 428 = 107*f Now, we need to find the value of \\"f\\". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by \\"107\\": 428 ÷ 107 = f When we divide 428 by 107, we get 4: f = 4 So, the value of \\"f\\" we found is 4. Yay!

Answer:","completion":"Langston Hughes, an influential American poet born in Joplin, Missouri, on February 1, 1902, authored numerous poems throughout his extensive career as a writer. Although it's challenging to definitively attribute a single poem to him solely based on him being from Joplin, one of Langston Hughes' most famous poems, entitled \\"I, Too,\\" reflects his experiences growing up as an African American in the early 20th century. \\"I, Too\\" is an evocative poem that resonates with many readers due to its themes of individuality, resilience, and hope for a brighter future. Written in 1926, it highlights the struggle for racial equality and justice in America, which was profoundly shaped by the Jim Crow era's racial segregation and discrimination. Langston Hughes elaborates on this by taking on the persona of a Black servant who faces rejection and separation from mainstream society. In the poem, Hughes confidently proclaims that the narrator, like the rest of America, is part of the nation, and the time will come when he will no longer be treated as inferior. Through allusions, metaphorical depictions, and an optimistic outlook, he envisions a day when Black Americans will be fully acknowledged as vital members of the American society. This idea creates a powerful message of unity and growth, which remains relevant to ongoing debates about race, identity, and belonging. As a leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance, Langston Hughes was inspired by the lives of Black people and their culture. This movement, which began in the 1920s, consisted of African American artists, writers, and musicians who sought to illuminate the beauty of Black culture and assert its position as an integral component of American history. The Harlem Renaissance served as a platform for African American voices, with renowned figures like Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, and Duke Ellington, amongst others. In conclusion, Langston Hughes, the poet from Joplin, MO, wrote many poems in his lifetime. One of his most famous works, \\"I, Too,\\" exemplifies his capacity to represent the spirit, resilience, and hope of African Americans during the early 20th century. While it is impossible to definitively connect a single poem to the town of Joplin, \\"I, Too\\" serves as an essential reminder of the writer's ongoing relevance and dedication to addressing issues related to race and social justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

A border's primary purpose is to complement and enhance the overall appearance of the image, as well as provide structural support to protect the enclosed picture over time. Therefore, it is crucial to select a suitable border that ensures both beauty and stability. In this scenario, the narrow border was incapable of meeting these requirements, as it failed to accommodate the dimensions and aesthetics of the picture. Undoubtedly, a border of the correct width is essential for fulfilling the aforementioned goals. Should the edge have been too wide, it might have potentially dominated the visual aspects of the artwork, diminishing its impact on the viewer. Conversely, if the border had been extremely thin, it would have failed as a protective measure, leaving the picture susceptible to damage. To remedy such a situation and make the most out of one's artwork, it is advisable to seek professional guidance from a framer or art consultant, who can offer valuable insights into the appropriate type of border. Factors like the width, color, style, and material of the border should be taken into consideration to create the perfect combination, which complements the picture instead of competing against it. Additionally, customized borders can be a particularly appealing option, as they allow for an increased level of personalization to suit individual tastes. In summary, finding the right balance is crucial in border selection, especially when considering the width. Though the narrow border posed a challenge in our example, a proper resolution can be reached by consulting with art professionals and exploring various options. Ultimately, selecting a fitting border will serve to accentuate the visual appeal of the artwork while ensuring its maintenance and longevity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Working together, the ICU and Al-Shabaab succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of Mogadishu. That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Those fears -- combined with a request from Somalia's transitional government -- led Ethiopian forces to enter Somalia in December 2006 and to remove the ICU from power. That move proved to be a turning point, one that radicalized Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is Al-Shabaab's relationship with Kenya? In 2011, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion intended to create a security buffer zone in southern Somalia after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya that it blamed on Al-Shabaab. More recently, Ethiopian troops crossed the border and expelled Al-Shabaab from Baidoa, a strategic town midway between the Ethiopian border and Mogadishu. The group then targeted African Union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks. A suicide bombing in March 2012 killed five people at the Presidential Palace. Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group. There may also have been disagreement within the group about the announcement in February 2012 of an alliance between Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda and about the group's ban on foreign aid organizations working in Somalia to save millions threatened by famine. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack. How and from where does it recruit? The organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities. \\"Remember Mumbai?\\" one tweet asked Saturday, as gunfire was erupting from Westgate mall in Nairobi. The comment was an apparent reference to the 2008 attack in which 10 Pakistani men associated with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed several buildings in Mumbai, India, killing 164 people over a three-day period. \\"Some youngsters resist death even when told not to be taken alive. It's going to be a long ordeal,\\" Saturday's tweet said. Soon after, it announced it was responsible for Saturday's attack in Nairobi, Kenya. \\"Alshabab confirms its behind the #Westgate spectacle,\\" it said. A 2009 Al-Shabaab video is as slickly produced as a reality TV show, complete with a hip-hop jihad voice and a startling message. \\"Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,\\" an unidentified voice raps on the video in American English. The video shows a man reported to have been Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, a U.S. citizen from Alabama. \\"Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,\\" he says. But enemies -- and alliances -- can shift. Al-Amriki, whose real name is Omar Hammami, said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab \\"regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy\\" and feared for his life. He was reported last week to have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab. CNN is not able to confirm the report. Finding replacements may not be hard. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training. How is it funded? The once ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other \\"fees,\\" according to the 2011 United Nations report. The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad. In 2011, it was generating \\"between 70 million and 100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,\\" according to the report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. How have Somalis been affected? Years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that Al-Shabaab has not helped. In 2011, the United Nations declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle, and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas. That year, the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation announced that Somalia had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world. In May, a report jointly commissioned by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network reported that 258,000 Somalis had died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012 and that half of the victims were younger than five. What is the United States doing? The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group. It has also donated millions in aid. The U.S. State Department said this week that Somali security forces, aided by the African Union Mission in Somalia, have driven Al-Shabaab out of major cities and towns, creating \\"a window of opportunity to fundamentally change Somalia's trajectory. What is the status of Somalia's government today? In September 2012, Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation, which had not had a stable central government since Barre's overthrow 21 years before. That did not mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits. In January, French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group. The raid left the soldier dead, another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead. But there has been political progress there. In January, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government. Want to know more about Somalia? Get the fast facts.

Al-Shabaab, an Islamist extremist group, formed in Somalia around 2006 and later allied with Al-Qaeda in 2012. The group seeks to impose its interpretation of Islamic law and expel foreign influences from Somalia. 2. Al-Shabaab gained control of Mogadishu in 2006, sparking fears of violence spilling over to Ethiopia. Ethiopian forces subsequently entered Somalia in December 2006 and removed the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) from power, pushing Al-Shabaab into a more radicalized direction. 3. Kenya has had a strained relationship with Al-Shabaab since 2011 when the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion into Somalia to create a security buffer zone after the group attacked tourist destinations in northern Kenya. 4. The group recruits members from within Somalia as well as from the Somali diaspora living in western countries. They use propaganda and social media outlets to attract and radicalize new members. 5. Al-Shabaab is funded through a variety of sources, including extortion, illegal taxation, duties, and fees levied at airports and seaports. In 2011, the group raised between 70 million and 100 million in revenue, according to the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. 6. Somalia has been negatively affected by Al-Shabaab's actions, with famine and high mortality rates for children under five. The group's ban on foreign aid organizations has exacerbated these issues. 7. The United States has supported counterterrorism efforts against Al-Shabaab and provided aid to Somalia. In 2012, the U.S. officially recognized the Somali government for the first time in more than two decades."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does it follow that \\"Many people were there.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"There were lots of people\\" does imply that \\"Many people were there.\\" Both statements convey the same underlying meaning, which is that there was a significant number of individuals present at a particular location or event. While they use different phrases, they both serve to emphasize the abundance of people in the given context. Let's examine these two statements more closely to better understand their similarities and differences. 1. \\"There were lots of people\\": In this statement, \\"lots\\" is a colloquial expression used to suggest a considerable quantity or number. By saying \\"lots of people,\\" it paints a picture of a crowded area or a large gathering where the presence of people is quite noticeable. This statement can be used in various situations, such as describing attendance at a party, a busy marketplace, or a popular tourist destination. 2. \\"Many people were there\\": This statement uses \\"many\\" to denote an indefinite but considerable number of people. Much like \\"lots,\\" \\"many\\" highlights the idea that there is a sizable gathering or crowd at a specific location or event. This statement can be employed in similar contexts as \\"There were lots of people,\\" although \\"many\\" might be considered a slightly more formal choice of wording. While both phrases underscore the abundance of people, it is important to note that neither statement provides an exact number. Instead, they allow the listener or reader to infer that the number of people present was significant or noteworthy. This can be a useful way of emphasizing the popularity or success of an event or location, or drawing attention to a specific aspect, such as overcrowding. In sum, the statements \\"There were lots of people\\" and \\"Many people were there\\" are essentially interchangeable, as they both express the idea that a significant number of people were present in a certain situation. As a result, either phrase can be used to emphasize the substantial presence of individuals at a location or event, depending on the particular context and the desired level of formality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there.
