The move prompted howls of protests from supporters of the whistleblowing organization as well as American conservatives, who have found ammunition in a trove of private Democratic National Committee emails released in recent weeks by Assange's outfit. Ecuadoran officials and their counterparts in the State Department have denied that the move to cut off his Internet access was prompted by U.S. government pressure, as my colleague Nick Miroff reports. But all was not quite lost for Assange. On Wednesday morning, Bobby Mair, a Canadian comedian based in the British capital, appeared outside the Ecuadoran Embassy with a megaphone and a sign around his neck that read “Julian Assange's personal Internet service.” He then proceeded to shout out headlines and tidbits of global information into what presumably is Assange's window.

Assange sought asylum in Ecuador out of fear of being extradited to Sweden, where he is accused of rape.

Midway through releasing a series of damaging disclosures about U.S. presidential contender Hillary Clinton, WikiLeaks founder... (Associated Press) QUITO, Ecuador (AP) — WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is finding himself in open conflict with his Ecuadorean protectors as the group's latest dump targeting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign runs afoul of the South American government's goal of warming up to Washington. Ecuador's move to cut off his internet access at its embassy in London was a stinging rebuke from leftist President Rafael Correa, who in 2012 heralded Assange as a digital-age Robin Hood and granted him asylum over protests from the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden, where he faces allegations of rape. Correa's government said Tuesday that WikiLeaks' publication of a trove of damaging emails from Clinton's campaign had impacted the U.S. election in violation of Ecuador's traditional respect for other nations' sovereignty. Analysts say Correa is unlikely to now kick Assange out into the streets of London where he faces certain arrest. But allowing him to keep leaking secrets from the embassy risks putting the small Andean nation unwittingly on Russia's side of a brewing cyber-battle with the United States, Ecuador's top trade partner, at a time of deep economic stress. \\"Before, the costs for Ecuador of hosting Assange were minor,\\" said Santiago Basabe, a political analyst at the Latin American School of Social Sciences in Quito. \\"But they are growing bigger now because they involve questions of U.S. national security, its tense relations with Russia and the presidential elections.\\" The cascade of disclosures of Democratic operatives' hacked emails, including this week's publication of Clinton's speeches to Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs, has been hailed by Republican candidate Donald Trump as evidence of his rival's dishonesty. However, U.S. intelligence agents say the hack is the work of the Kremlin, although it's not clear how the files ended up with WikiLeaks. Regardless, Ecuador has plenty of reasons to try to curry favor with Washington. The oil-dependent, dollarized economy is fighting a recession made worse by low crude prices, a destructive earthquake in April and a strong U.S. dollar. Adding to the uncertainty is Correa's imminent departure from office after a decade in power that provided a sense of stability after years of coups and revolving-door presidencies. Analysts say whoever wins February's election — Correa's preferred successor currently leads polls — is almost certain to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. In such a scenario the support of the Washington, the biggest shareholder in the IMF, will be key in determining how severe an austerity program is required. \\"Assange has inserted Ecuador in the U.S. presidential campaign and exposed it to retaliation in case Clinton wins,\\" said former Foreign Minister Mauricio Gandara, adding that the publication of stolen documents is considered a crime in Ecuador. Correa, who in 2009 closed the only U.S. military base in South America and two years later expelled the U.S. ambassador, still peppers his speeches with anti-Yankee harangues in the mold of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. But with Venezuela in economic freefall and ideological allies losing power in countries like Argentina and Brazil, Correa has quietly extended an olive branch to the Obama administration and sought to deepen commercial ties. This week he's hosting a U.S. trade delegation. Correa also praised Clinton in an interview last month with Moscow-based broadcaster RT. \\"For the good of the United States and the world, and for my personal appreciation of her, I'd like to see Hillary win,\\" he said. Tensions between Assange and his hosts have surfaced before. In 2013, Correa criticized him for shooting a video from the embassy mocking Australian politicians during a political campaign. On Tuesday, Ecuador said WikiLeaks' \\"journalistic activities\\" would not be affected by the \\"temporary restrictions\\" on Assange's communications. Assange accused Ecuador of bowing to U.S. pressure and alleged that Secretary of State John Kerry discussed the issue with Correa last month in Colombia, something both Washington and Quito deny. It seems unlikely he will submit to the internet ban quietly. Over the weekend WikiLeaks released three lines of code it described as \\"pre-commitments,\\" labeling them \\"John Kerry,\\" ''Ecuador,\\" and \\"FCO\\" — an apparent reference to Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Pre-commitments are cryptographic functions that can be used to verify the integrity of material released subsequently. Security experts interpreted that as a warning to the named parties that WikiLeaks has ammunition in reserve that could embarrass his hosts as well. For most Ecuadoreans, Assange's case seems like a Hollywood spy movie with little bearing on their daily life. But even Correa's opponents have shown little enthusiasm for revoking the Australian's asylum. \\"We can't just throw him out of the embassy from night to day because he could be exposed to risks,\\" opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso said last month, even while arguing that Assange was breaking the conditions of his asylum. ___ AP writers Joshua Goodman in Bogota, Colombia, and Raphael Satter in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Arkin and Robert Windrem Quiet pressure from the U.S. government played a role in Ecuador’s decision to block WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from using the internet at Ecuador’s London embassy, U.S. officials told NBC News. “It was a bit of an eviction notice,” said a senior intelligence official. Ecuador's government said Tuesday it had partly restricted internet access for Assange, the founder of anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks, who has lived in the South American country's London embassy for more than four years. A source familiar with the situation says the Ecuadoran government has been frustrated with Assange and his presence at the embassy in London for months and has been considering how best to proceed. The action came after U.S. officials conveyed their conclusion that Assange is a willing participant in a Russian intelligence operation to undermine the U.S. presidential election, NBC News has learned. U.S. intelligence officials believe Assange knows he is getting the information from Russian intelligence, though they do not believe he is involved in helping plan the hacking, officials told NBC. “The general view is he is a willing participant in the Russian scheme but not an active plotter in it. They just realized they could use him,” said a senior intelligence official. “It was a bit of an eviction notice.” WikiLeaks has been posting the private emails of Clinton adviser John Podesta and other Democratic officials that the U.S. says were hacked by, or on behalf of, Russian intelligence agencies. WikiLeaks said Assange’s internet access was cut off Sunday. In a statement, Ecuador said the decision was its own. “Ecuador, exercising its sovereign right, has temporarily restricted access to part of its communications systems in its UK Embassy,\\" the statement said. \\"The Ecuador government respects the principle of non-intervention in other countries' affairs, it does not meddle in election processes underway, nor does it support any candidate specially.\\" A senior administration official said that the U.S. did not push Ecuador to cut Assange off from the internet: \\"Reports that the U.S. government, to include the Intelligence Community, pressured the Ecuadorian government to interrupt internet service within Ecuador's embassy in London are not accurate.\\" The State Department said it did not pressure Ecuador or play any other role in blocking Assange's internet access. \\"While our concerns about WikiLeaks are longstanding, any suggestion that Secretary (John) Kerry or the State Department were involved in shutting down WikiLeaks is false,\\" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. However, U.S. intelligence officials told NBC that a message was conveyed to Ecuador that it should stop allowing Assange to carry water for Russian intelligence agencies, and that Ecuador, though run by a leftist, anti-American government, was receptive. The U.S. moves come as bipartisan concern is growing about the alleged Russian interference amid a daily release of Podesta emails. Marco Rubio, who is running to retain his Florida Senate seat after losing the Republican presidential primary to Donald Trump, urged members of his party not to seek to capitalize on emails stolen by Russian spies. \\"As our intelligence agencies have said, these leaks are an effort by a foreign government to interfere with our electoral process, and I will not indulge it,” Rubio told ABC News. \\"Further, I want to warn my fellow Republicans who may want to capitalize politically on these leaks: Today it is the Democrats. Tomorrow it could be us.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"The Ecuadorian Embassy in London has cut off WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange's internet access, so Canadian comedian Bobby Mair offered to read him highlights of the internet through a megaphone.

Coherent written texts do not appear until the second half of the 8th century, and some treat the period before 750 as \\"prehistoric\\" and date the start of Old High German proper to 750 for this reason. There are, however, a number of Elder Futhark inscriptions dating to the 6th century (notably the Pforzen buckle), as well as single words and many names found in Latin texts predating the 8th century. - Polish (\\"jzyk polski\\", \\"polszczyzna\\") is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in Poland and is the native language of the Poles. It belongs to the Lechitic subgroup of the West Slavic languages. Polish is the official language of Poland, but it is also used throughout the world by Polish minorities in other countries. It is one of the official languages of the European Union. Its written standard is the Polish alphabet, which has 9 additions to the letters of the basic Latin script (\\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"ó\\", \\"\\", \\"\\", \\"\\").

But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails. There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University. Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails. 1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break. 2.Horizontal lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration. 3. Vertical lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging. 4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid. 5. Kidney and liver problems can create \\"half-and-half nails\\", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick. Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. What is the main idea of the passage? A) Doctors can tell us something about our health by looking at our nails. B) We should see a doctor if we find nails in bad condition.

Now a rich industrialist, he lives in luxury in a Manhattan high-rise. He banters with his assistant Charlie, often shocking him with his outrageousness and irreverence about aspects of Jewish life. One day, Israeli secret agents kidnap Goldman and take him to Israel for trial on charges of being a Nazi war criminal. Goldman's trial forces his accusers to face not only his presumed guilt, but their own as well. At the end it appears that Goldman falsified the dental records which the Israelis used to identify him in order to bring about the trial. When the deception is revealed by the Israeli prosecutor, Goldman is left standing in the trial court's bulletproof glass box, a broken man.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). Palindromes have been of interest to linguists, mathematicians, and recreational puzzle enthusiasts for many centuries. The palindrome \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" was attributed to Leigh Mercer, a British wordplay expert, and first appeared in the November 13, 1948, issue of \\"Notes and Queries,\\" a scholarly journal for the discussion of historical and etymological topics. This particular palindrome is remarkable because of its length, coherence, and historical significance. The phrase itself references the construction of the Panama Canal, an artificial waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canal's construction was a challenging and ambitious project, involving many people, notably the French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps and the American President Theodore Roosevelt, as well as a significant amount of planning and engineering expertise. A closer look at the palindrome reveals a logical progression of ideas that makes it more meaningful than many other examples of palindromes, which are often nonsensical or purely pattern-based: - \\"A man\\" can represent the individuals responsible for the canal's creation, such as the aforementioned visionaries, politicians, and engineers. - \\"A plan\\" signifies the immense strategic efforts and various planning phases involved in such an ambitious endeavor. - \\"A canal\\" denotes the actual physical construction and existence of the Panama Canal. - \\"Panama\\" is the geographical location where the canal was built, a vital link between two major oceans. Given this context, \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" is not only an impressive palindrome but also a succinct summary of the significant human effort required to make the Panama Canal a reality. In summary, the phrase \\"A man a plan a canal Panama\\" is a celebrated example of a palindrome, a linguistic construction that reads the same forward and backward. It provides a meaningful, albeit condensed, account of the Panama Canal's development and exemplifies the ingenuity and expertise of those behind its creation, making it a noteworthy example of playful yet purposeful language use."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CHAPTER 30 She's a winsome wee thing, She's a handsome wee thing, She's a bonnie wee thing, This sweet wee wifie of mine. --BURNS 'Look here, Amy,' said Guy, pointing to a name in the traveller's book at Altdorf. 'Captain Morville!' she exclaimed, 'July 14th. That was only the day before yesterday.' 'I wonder whether we shall overtake him! Do you know what was this gentleman's route?' inquired Guy, in French that was daily becoming more producible. The gentleman having come on foot, with nothing but his knapsack, had not made much sensation. There was a vague idea that he had gone on to the St. Gothard; but the guide who was likely to know, was not forthcoming, and all Guy's inquiries only resulted in, 'I dare say we shall hear of him elsewhere.' To tell the truth, Amabel was not much disappointed, and she could see, though he said nothing, that Guy was not very sorry. These two months had been so very happy, there had been such full enjoyment, such freedom from care and vexation, or aught that could for a moment ruffle the stream of delight. Scenery, cathedrals music, paintings, historical association, had in turn given unceasing interest and pleasure; and, above all, Amabel had been growing more and more into the depths of her husband's mind, and entering into the grave, noble thoughts inspired by the scenes they were visiting. It had been a sort of ideal happiness, so exquisite, that she could hardly believe it real. A taste of society, which they had at Munich, though very pleasant, had only made them more glad to be alone together again; any companion would have been an interruption, and Philip, so intimate, yet with his carping, persecuting spirit towards Guy, was one of the last persons she could wish to meet; but knowing that this was by no means a disposition Guy wished to encourage, she held her peace. 1.

There is currently no precise test with the diagnosis typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time. A diagnosis of asthma should be suspected if there is a history of: recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution. Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry. When should you suspect asthma?","completion":"You should suspect asthma if there is a history of: 1. Recurrent wheezing: Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound made while breathing, particularly during exhalation, and is a common symptom of asthma. 2. Coughing: A persistent or recurrent cough, especially during the night or after exercise, may indicate asthma. 3. Difficulty breathing: Experiencing shortness of breath or trouble breathing, especially during activities or at night, could be a sign of asthma. Additionally, if these symptoms occur or worsen due to certain triggers, it further supports the suspicion of asthma. These triggers may include: 1. Exercise: If symptoms are triggered or worsened by physical activity, it may be a sign of exercise-induced asthma. 2. Viral infections: Asthma symptoms can be triggered or exacerbated by respiratory infections, such as the common cold or flu. 3. Allergens: Exposure to allergens like pollen, pet dander, or dust mites can provoke asthma symptoms in some individuals. 4. Air pollution: Airborne irritants and pollutants, such as smoke or smog, can worsen asthma symptoms. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional if you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms for proper diagnosis and management.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. My sixth grader has a secret life online. It wasn't so secret about a week ago when I discovered his public profile on Instagram, where he was posting dramatic photos and soulful \\"Versagrams\\" (graphical text messages), for all the world to see. One moment he was in love, the next full of despair. I was stunned. My 11-year-old son has never let on that he is remotely interested in girls. Not a word. And he's not exactly the middle school kid with swagger. He's a relatively shy guy. Yet, his Instagram avatar was boldly flirting with a girl, prolifically posting inside jokes about his crush and inviting commentary not only from his school friends, but also from a far-flung social network of kids from Connecticut to New Jersey who I am certain he's never met in person. His phone was beeping nonstop for three days, with a stream of frenzied text messages and Instagram posts. Something big was going on. My son wanted to ask a girl out. Did she like him, too? He wasn't sure, but from what I saw online, this was hardly confidential information. His plan for asking her out was getting circulated in cyberspace and he had several kids weighing in on both the strategy and his likelihood for success. He was fully exposed on multiple virtual platforms, and that was terrifying to me. He clearly didn't understand the full impact of online activity. What should I do? Young people and social media: Docs examine pitfalls. When my son was sleeping, I was checking the text messages and followed the Instagram updates -- after all, this wasn't really sneaking if my son maintained a public profile. But what could I say? Should I tell him that I am monitoring his moves? Was my looking at text messages the same as reading a diary? Was I violating my son's privacy and simply making too much of this? My husband told me to back off, that our son was merely a kid with a crush who needed to experience this rite of passage on his own, without a hovering mother. But I wasn't so sure. Like many parents, I am struggling with the boundaries of monitoring my kids' online activities. Is it an invasion of our children's privacy to intercept or check their text messages, or have the rules changed for parents because of the pure power and danger of technology? Am I justified in cyberstalking my own son? A first crush is hard enough, but I am trying to protect him from the embarrassment that can come from exposing this personal experience online. Adults know that a careless e-mail, text message, tweet or photo posting can cost someone not only their reputation, but also their career. The scandal over former CIA Director David Petraeus' extramarital affair apparently started with an e-mail breach. If the CIA director can get sloppy with personal e-mails, how can we trust a kid to handle these tools any better? How to raise a winning child. Experts say that it's important for parents to proactively monitor their kids' online behavior. \\"It's snooping only if we don't tell them we're doing it,\\" said Scott Steinberg the author of the best-selling \\"Modern Parent's Guide\\" series. \\"You need to have the discussion up front about why you are there and why you are monitoring their online activity. Passively knowing that a parent is present can alter kids' behavior online. Parents won't intrude on their kids' experience if they do it in a way that's upfront and straightforward.\\" Parenting in a post-Facebook era where a new, must-have, social media app is churned out every two minutes makes monitoring exhausting, if not impossible. But while I believe my son knows not to communicate with \\"strangers,\\" the way he's exposing his life in cyberspace is making me tense. But he's hardly alone. The photos and messages that his fellow tween friends post on Instagram alternate between silly and provocative. Maybe it's the digital photo-filters, but the girls seem sexy beyond their years. While it's our duty as parents to teach our kids responsibility with technology, how much can we interfere with their freedom of expression? Steinberg says it's important that parents are educated about what's out there and are on top of their kids' online behavior without getting totally crazy. He says that parents can't just hand their kids digital devices and expect that they understand netiquette. But at the same time, parents need to respect boundaries. Confessions of a busy mom: 5 lessons. \\"Just because you can see what's online doesn't mean that you should obsess over it and micromanage every text message,\\" Steinberg said. \\"There are boundaries for parents as well. And at the end of the day, you don't want to become paranoid. You really just want to open an honest dialogue and positive computing. You can't put your kid on a leash, virtual or otherwise.\\" After agonizing for a few nights over how to handle it all, I told my son that he needed to change his settings to private so pedophiles and other \\"creepy people\\" can't follow his posts. He's a clever kid and understood that I was on to him. It was an unspoken acknowledgment that I had seen what he was putting out there. So he's gone private. The settings are locked. I asked if I could follow him on Instagram and he immediately said no. Steinberg would say that parents need to \\"friend\\" their kids or follow them online. But what if they refuse? It's well known that kids can be stealth and may \\"friend\\" their parents on one site or app, but post on another. Parents can pull the plug on the technology perhaps for a little while, or you can sneak a peak at their phones and devices, like I do regularly now, without any guilt. Like CNN Living on Facebook.

Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article is about a mother grappling with the dilemma of monitoring her sixth-grade son's online activities on social media platforms like Instagram, where he was sharing posts about his secret crush. She discusses the challenges of finding the right balance between respecting her child's privacy and ensuring that he is being responsible with technology. The author also cites the opinion of an expert, Scott Steinberg, who suggests that parents should proactively monitor their kids' online behavior but also have an upfront discussion with them about why they are doing it. Steinberg stresses the importance of parents being educated about what is out there and staying on top of their kids' online activities without obsessing over every detail. Ultimately, the goal is to encourage open dialogue and responsible use of technology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a public comment from online platforms. You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: threat and non-threat. Threat is a statement that someone will be hurt or harmed, especially if the person does not do something in particular. Q: Comment: Shouldn't you be shooting up a pizza place? A:","completion":"This is a tricky question because it seems to reference violent activity (shooting), but the context is unclear. However, it does come across as offensive and could be interpreted as a veiled threat, especially if it's directed towards a specific individual. It doesn't directly state that the person \\"will\\" be harmed, so in the most strict interpretation, it might not be categorized completely as a threat. However, the violent undertone cannot be ignored. Step 1: Identify the context - In this step, we look for any sign of potential harm indicated either directly or indirectly. Here, although the harm isn't directly pointed out, the phrase \\"shooting up\\" carries a violent connotation, which indicates potential threat. Step 2: Determine the target - It is unclear who the target is. However, due to the violent nature of the comment, this could potentially be directed towards a specific individual, group, or entity. Step 3: Consider the intent - The user comment seems to be a rhetorical question with negative implications. In a certain context, it may be a sarcastic comment or a bully's remark, so the intention could be to intimidate or instigate a reaction. After detailed analysis on the given information, I would classify this comment as a 'threat' due to its violent connotation and potential harm that could happen in the scenario it describes. The classification also incorporates the potential for harm not only to a specific individual, but potentially any individual linked to the comment's scenario. The safety and mental health of the individuals using these platforms should be a top priority, and erring on the side of caution in situations with potential for harm is best."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Additionally, an individual cannot simply create money for themselves at a mint, as this would be illegal. This option does not align with the goal of making money. 2. \\"selling things\\" - Selling things, whether they are physical products or services, is a common and legal method for individuals to earn money.

Write a title for this article: British businessman Shrien Dewani left South Africa on Tuesday a day after being acquitted of arranging the murder of his wife on their honeymoon in Cape Town. Journalists witnessed Dewani board an Emirates flight to Dubai from Cape Town international airport. He is believed to be travelling via Dubai back to the UK, where he will pick up his life again four years after he was arrested at the request of the South African authorities who wanted to speak to him about his wife’s murder during their honeymoon. Dewani, 34, was escorted through the airport and ushered through security towards his flight. He looked calm and self-composed as he walked into the airport, wearing a tight white shirt and dark jeans, and stared resolutely ahead as police officers helped him through a waiting media scrum. Accompanied by his family and officials from the British consulate in Cape Town, Dewani did not check in directly, but walked straight though to international departures. About a dozen South African police officers were also present to ensure the Briton was able to enter the airport freely. He did not respond to journalists’ questions and stared ahead as photographers and TV crews jostled to take his picture. Dewani is free to return to the UK after the judge, Jeanette Traverso, dismissed the case against him on Monday, describing evidence against him as being “riddled with contradictions”. The collapse of the trial in Cape Town left his wife’s family devastated and Anni’s uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said they were exploring the possibility of taking legal action in the bid to find answers. Hindocha said the decision to halt the trial before Dewani gave evidence meant there were “holes to be filled” in the story about his niece’s final days. Speaking from Sweden, he told the Guardian: “We were hoping for closure. We still do not have that but hope that we will have it in the near future. We need to get the family together here and see what options we have, what possibilities we have to continue the process. “There is still determination to continue. Otherwise we will have sleepless nights for the rest of our lives. We choose determination.” The family will gather in Sweden over Christmas to plan their next moves. “We need to be together; we’ve been away from each other for a long time now – some of the family here, some in the UK, some in South Africa. All we’ve had is telephone contact. We really need to speak all together and speak to lawyers and see what options we have.” Hindocha said the family’s “number one” option was some sort of legal action in the UK. Hindocha said Dewani, whose legal team said in court that he was bisexual, had lied to the family and to Anni about his sexuality. “He lied the moment he told Anni that he loved her and they were in a serious relationship. He lied to the priest in India [where the couple married]. He should have spoken the truth and said: ‘Look Anni, I love you but I’m gay, bisexual.’ I think that is a crucial thing. When you go into a long-term relationship you must be honest.” Of the legal process in Cape Town, he said: “We didn’t get the full story out of South Africa. The judge wouldn’t allow it. There were crucial points to be debated.” He conceded there were holes in the evidence of taxi driver Zola Tongo. “But I’m sure many of those holes could have been filled if Shrien had been cross-examined. We never got the answers. We never got the chance to know. He’s never been cross-examined. The judge in South Africa bought everything that Shrien’s lawyer said.” Asked about what he thought of the image of Dewani leaving South Africa via Cape Town airport, Hindocha said: “We never said who is guilty, who is not guilty. Our objective has been that we want to know the truth. We did not get it from South Africa. We are hoping in the near future to get this truth.” Title:","completion":"\\"Shrien Dewani Acquitted and Departs South Africa: Wife's Family Seeks Further Legal Action for Closure\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information: - William John Swainson FLS, FRS (8 October 1789 6 December 1855), was an English ornithologist, malacologist, conchologist, entomologist and artist. - Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785 26 October 1840) was an Irish zoologist and politician. He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system. - William Sharp Macleay or McLeay (21 July 1792 26 January 1865) was a British civil servant and entomologist. - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist . A proponent of natural philosophy , he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system . - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will? - Johann Jakob Kaup (10 April 1803 4 July 1873) was a German naturalist. A proponent of natural philosophy, he believed in an innate mathematical order in nature and he attempted biological classifications based on the Quinarian system. Biography. He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844). - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees. - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural science. What object entity has the relation of 'date of death' with the subject 'johann jakob kaup'?

Riparian areas refer to the interface between the land and a river or stream. These areas are characterized by moist and fertile soil, making them an ideal location for a wide variety of plant species to thrive. Beavers depend on an abundance of woody vegetation, such as willows and cottonwoods, for both food and building materials for their dams and lodges. When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park in the 1990s, it resulted in what is called a \\"trophic cascade.\\" Trophic cascades occur when the presence or absence of a top predator, such as the wolf, has a direct or indirect impact on other species' populations within an ecosystem. One of the significant impacts of this cascade was on the grazing behavior of elk, which are the primary prey of wolves. Before the reintroduction of wolves, large elk populations overgrazed the riparian areas, consuming nearly all of the young trees and shrubs. This intense grazing pressure led to a decrease in habitat quality and food availability for animals like beavers. However, once wolves were reintroduced, they began to prey on the elk and also altered their grazing patterns. Elk now spent less time in riparian areas to avoid being ambushed by wolves. This allowed the vegetation to recover, providing beavers with more food sources and building materials for their dams and lodges. Furthermore, the presence of beaver dams can create wetland habitats that support diverse plant and animal communities, which can benefit a variety of species, including the wolves themselves. In this way, the relationship between wolves and beavers in Yellowstone National Park is mutually beneficial and highlights the importance of maintaining a balanced ecosystem with the presence of top predators. In conclusion, the statement accurately describes the indirect role wolves play in helping beavers eat well within Yellowstone National Park. The presence of wolves protects riparian areas from overgrazing by elk, allowing for the recovery of vital plant species that serve as the primary food source for beavers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Three years later her daughter Tristane Banon claims he tried to rape her like 'rutting chimpanzee' Was delay in coming forward down to her mother's relationship with the 'Great Seducer'? Article:","completion":"Title: The Dark Side of the 'Great Seducer': Unraveling the Alleged Misconduct and its Impact on the Involved Parties Introduction: The recent surge of voices in the media and society has brought attention to the disturbing behavior of a man known as the 'Great Seducer'. His tumultuous relationships with women have raised concerns about the abuse of power and the culture of silence surrounding such incidents. In a shocking revelation, former colleague Anne Mansouret and her daughter Tristane Banon have described their encounters with the 'Great Seducer' in vivid, unsettling detail. This article will delve into their experiences and discuss the possible reasons for the delay in coming forward. Anne Mansouret's experience: In a candid interview, Anne Mansouret revealed the harrowing account of her encounter with the 'Great Seducer’. Mansouret expressed her shock and shame at the treatment she received, stating that \\"he took me with the vulgarity of a soldier.\\" The crude and forceful nature of the encounter left Mansouret feeling violated and humiliated. Such behavior from a powerful and influential figure in society is deeply troubling and raises questions about the ethics and integrity of powerful men. The fact that Mansouret suffered in silence for years highlights the fear that victims often feel when they consider confronting their abusers. Tristane Banon's allegations: Three years later, Mansouret's daughter, Tristane Banon, claimed to have faced a similar encounter with the 'Great Seducer'. In a chilling account, Banon described her alleged attacker as behaving like a \\"rutting chimpanzee\\" during her attempted rape. The graphic nature of her description underscores the horrifying nature of the experience. The fear and trauma experienced by Banon, and the knowledge of her mother's disturbing encounter, seemingly created a barrier that prevented her from coming forward earlier. This delay in reporting the incident reveals the complex emotions and complications that victims of abuse often face. The role of power dynamics and silence: The troubling aspect of these incidents is not just the violence and aggression perpetuated by the 'Great Seducer', but also the silence that surrounded these events for years. It raises vital questions about the role power dynamics play in preventing victims from speaking up and seeking justice. In the case of Anne Mansouret and Tristane Banon, one might argue that their delayed disclosure was influenced by the 'Great Seducer's' powerful position in society, as well as the fear of judgment and disbelief. This stifling impact on victims further perpetuates the culture of silence, which allows such behavior to continue unchecked. Conclusion: The shocking accounts of Anne Mansouret and Tristane Banon expose the darker side of the 'Great Seducer' and, on a broader scale, the darker side of power and privilege. As society grapples with allegations against influential figures, it is vital to break the silence and give a voice to victims. The stories of Mansouret and Banon serve as a harrowing reminder of the abuse that can occur in power dynamics, and the importance of empowering victims to come forward. Through the sharing of their experiences, they aim to shed light on the issue and, in turn, pave the way for other victims to overcome their fear and silence. As awareness grows, we must hold those who perpetuate such behavior accountable and cultivate a culture that supports and uplifts the voices of all victims."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Well-placed sources told BBC economics editor Robert Peston a decision to end the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) would be made by the ECB's governing council later on Sunday. Greek banks depend on ELA funds daily. Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said his government would consider overnight what measures to take \\"to minimise the burden on our people\\". Cutting the ECB lifeline could push Greece out of the euro. Such an ECB cut would mean \\"Europe has failed\\", Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's World this Weekend. It would mean Europe had \\"failed in its duty to preserve in parallel a democratic process and a monetary union\\", he said. \\"It is a dark hour for Europe.\\" The lenders have \\"not met Greece even a quarter of the way\\", he complained. The government would consider \\"what can be done to minimise the burden on our people from Europe's refusal to grant us democratic rights\\". A BBC reporter in Athens says long queues are forming at bank ATMs. The EU-IMF bailout for heavily indebted Greece expires on Tuesday and talks have broken down. Greek banks would find themselves in serious straits as soon as Monday if the ECB cut the ELA funding, Robert Peston says. Greece will probably have to announce a bank holiday on Monday, pending the introduction of capital controls, he says. It is one of the most momentous decisions the ECB has ever faced, since the euro was launched on 1 January 1999. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the ECB \\"is independent but... I don't think it can cut off rations [for the Greeks]\\". He said \\"it's the Greek nation that is suffering\\". Capital controls are restrictions on how much customers can withdraw from banks. Until now, the Greek government has signalled that it does not want to impose such controls. In recent weeks, Greeks have withdrawn billions of euros from banks. A Greek withdrawal from the euro - known as \\"Grexit\\" - is not inevitable, says Robert Peston, as the eurozone did resolve Cyprus's banking crisis in 2013 and the country stayed in the euro. Capital controls were imposed on Cypriot banks, and remained in place for a long time - the last restrictions were only lifted in April this year. Greece's situation is more difficult, our editor reports. Capital controls are seen as an important step towards leaving the euro, because the single currency's rules require free movement of capital. But Greece could remain in if its government and the bailout providers - the EU and IMF - can restart constructive negotiations, he reports. A country on the brink - chief correspondent Gavin Hewitt writes: It is the most important decision in the ECB's history. A withdrawal of funding could plunge Greece into chaos and yet the ECB cannot break its own rules by funding a banking system where the country is heading for a default. Alexis Tsipras has gambled both with his future and that of his country. He committed Greece to a vote, but only after the current bailout has expired, so leaving Greece vulnerable and exposed. Read Gavin's analysis in full here. What are the Greek papers saying? On Saturday eurozone finance ministers - the Eurogroup - refused to extend Greece's desperately-needed bailout beyond Tuesday. The ministers blamed Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras's surprise call for a referendum on 5 July on the bailout conditions. The final €7.2bn (£5bn; 8bn) of Greece's second bailout has been frozen since last summer, as lenders demanded more Greek progress on deep economic reform. Without more lending to Greece the country will default on a €1.6bn repayment due to the IMF on Tuesday. Under the rules governing the euro, the ECB's emergency lifeline could not be continued if the ECB considered Greek banks to be insolvent. Robert Peston says that with Greece no longer participating in a formal rescue programme, the solvency of the Greek state would be in doubt, as it is so intimately linked to the banks' solvency. Mr Tsipras's leftist Syriza government rejects the bailout terms, after five years of lender-imposed austerity that has increased Greek unemployment and cut pensions and welfare benefits. Greece has endured five years of recession, and total output (GDP) has shrunk by 25%. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The European Central Bank (ECB) faces a crucial decision regarding whether to end the Emergency Liquidity Assistance (ELA) for Greece, as Greek banks heavily depend on these funds daily.

Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis stated that if the ECB cut the ELA funding, it would mean \\"Europe has failed\\" and it would be a \\"dark hour for Europe.\\" With the EU-IMF bailout set to expire on Tuesday and talks having broken down, this has led to significant uncertainty regarding Greece's financial stability.

One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form.

In today's fast-paced world, taking the time to care for our plants during holidays can prove to be quite challenging. However, if we can devise simple yet effective ways to look after our green companions while we are away, the mutual benefits can make it all worthwhile. Firstly, ensuring that your plants receive the right amount of water during your absence is of utmost importance. There are numerous ways to achieve this, such as creating a simple self-watering system using a bottle filled with water and a piece of string to keep the soil moist. Alternatively, you can also invest in a drip irrigation system with a timer to water the plants at a predetermined interval. Secondly, maintaining suitable temperature and humidity levels for your plants is crucial. By placing them in a location that offers optimal conditions, such as near a window or a landing, you can ensure their well-being even when you aren't present to monitor them. Additionally, investing in a smart thermostat can help regulate temperature and humidity levels, enabling you to control environmental factors remotely. Another aspect to consider is sufficient lighting for your plants. Placing them near a window that receives ample sunlight will help them thrive while you're away. However, if this is not feasible, purchasing an automatic timer for an artificial light source can ensure that your plants receive the necessary amount of light during your absence. It is also beneficial to prepare your plants for your holiday by taking care of their pruning, fertilizing, and pest control needs well ahead of time. This can minimize the chances of them developing problems while you're away. Taking these measures also gives your plants the required energy and health to sustain themselves during the period of your absence.

Answer the following question: What were the names of the two towns that have become known as Weymouth? Answer the above question based on the context below: Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Write the answer: Which American writer and poet left an unfinished work called Cantos","completion":"Ezra Pound, an American writer and poet, left behind an unfinished work that came to be known as \\"The Cantos.\\" Born on October 30, 1885, in Hailey, Idaho, Ezra Weston Loomis Pound was a significant figure in the early modernist movement in poetry, playing a crucial role in the development of Imagism and Vorticism. Throughout his career, he was known for his distinctive style and his ability to synthesize elements from various cultures and traditions. \\"The Cantos\\" is considered one of Pound's most ambitious and enigmatic works. It is a collection of long poems that the poet worked on, on and off, for over five decades, beginning in 1915 and continuing until his death in 1972. The poems that comprise \\"The Cantos\\" can be seen as a series of interconnected fragments, in which Pound sought to create a grand synthesis of world history, culture, and mythology. The epic poem remains unfinished, as Pound did not complete it before his death. The 120 extant cantos are often divided into three distinct sections, each with its unique focus and themes: 1. The \\"Ur-Cantos\\" (Cantos I-XVI): In the initial cantos, Pound explores various historical figures and moments from the past, such as the troubadour poets, the Renaissance, and Thomas Jefferson. These cantos revolve around the theme of creative influence and how different cultures have shaped one another throughout history. 2. The \\"Pisan Cantos\\" (Cantos LXXIV-LXXXIV): Pound wrote these poems while he was detained in a U.S. Army Disciplinary Training Center near Pisa, Italy, during World War II. He spent his time there in rather harsh conditions, including living in an open cage, which greatly affected his mental and emotional state. The \\"Pisan Cantos\\" contain references to various historical and literary figures, personal experiences, memories, and thoughts on war and politics. These cantos are often considered some of Pound's most poignant and personal work. 3. The \\"Latter Cantos\\" (Cantos LXXXV-CXX): The final cantos are more fragmented and experimental, as Pound's health began to deteriorate towards the end of his life. He wrote these after his release from St. Elizabeth's Hospital, where he had been admitted for mental illness following his arrest for treason during the war. The themes in these cantos cover a diverse range of topics such as economics, politics, mythology, and art. Despite its unfinished state, \\"The Cantos\\" is widely regarded as a core part of Pound's literary legacy. While it remains a complex and enigmatic work, the poem showcases the poet's profound knowledge, keen insights, and innovative approach to form and content. The Cantos gives readers a view into the vast intellectual landscape that shaped Ezra Pound's worldview. Its influence can be seen in the works of various poets who came after Pound, including Allen Ginsberg, T.S. Eliot, and Robert Lowell. Though its subject matter and structure can be overwhelming, \\"The Cantos\\" continues to be a subject of intense study and admiration among scholars, critics, and poetry enthusiasts alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I normally do not post certain types of things on my blog or on social media, like political messages, but today I feel compelled. I’ve been thinking for the last few days about the most recent school shooting in Parkland, and my overwhelming emotion right after grief is rage. I am so angry it makes me cry and for those of you out there who know me, angry-cry is the end-stage, top-of-the-gauge level of angry for me. I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations. I am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action. This stops now. I am angry that in 2012, 20 6-7 year old children and 6 adults were murdered in Sandy Hook and in the 5+ years since, we have done nothing meaningful to stop this. To me, this is tantamount to saying that we as a nation are OK with this. I don’t think we are, but that’s the message we’re sending if we don’t force our government to do something.

Read this article and answer this question The PRI, or Institutional Revolutionary Party is one of the major lasting legacies of the Mexican Revolution; its first iteration was the Partido Nacional Revolucionario founded in 1929 under Northern revolutionary general and president of Mexico Plutarco Elías Calles, following the assassination of president-elect Álvaro Obregón in 1928. The establishment of the party created an enduring structure that managed not only presidential succession but also groups with competing interests. Initially, Calles remained the power behind the presidency during a period known as the Maximato, but his hand-picked presidential candidate, Lázaro Cárdenas, won a power struggle with Calles, expelling him from the country. Cárdenas reorganized the party that Calles founded, creating formal sectors for interest groups, including one for the Mexican military. The reorganized party was named Party of the Mexican Revolution. In 1946, the party again changed its name to the Institutional Revolutionary Party. The party under its various names held the presidency from 1929 to 2000 and since 2012, is the party again in power. How many years before 2005 did the PRI hold the presidency?","completion":"To find out how many years before 2005 the PRI held the presidency, we need to first identify the years the PRI controlled the presidency.

Question: Different wavelength electromagnetic radiations have different uses. John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which wavelengths would be longer, case B or case C? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question correctly, we need to determine which wavelengths are longer between case B (infrared light) and case C (visible light). Understanding the properties of these electromagnetic radiations will help us make the comparison. In the electromagnetic spectrum, the order of electromagnetic radiations from longer wavelengths to shorter wavelengths is as follows: radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays. Given this information, we can see that infrared light (case B) appears earlier in the spectrum than visible light (case C). This means that infrared light has longer wavelengths than visible light.

Option A: 126 Option B: Rs.121 Option C: 165 Option D: 134 Option E: 123 A:","completion":"To find the interest gained, first, we need to calculate the compound interest for each deposit separately. For the deposit made on 1st January, the interest will be calculated for a full year. For the deposit made on 1st July, the interest will be calculated for 6 months, or half-yearly. Given that the bank offers a 5% compound interest calculated on a half-yearly basis, and the interest rate for half a year would be 5%/2 = 2.5%. Now, let's calculate the interest for each deposit: 1. For the first deposit (Rs. 1600) on 1st January (1 year = 2 half-years): Applying the formula for Compound Interest: A = P × (1 + r/100)^n A = 1600 × (1 + 2.5/100)^2 A = 1600 × (1.025^2) A = 1600 × 1.050625 A = 1681 Interest = A - P = 1681 - 1600 = Rs. 81 2. For the second deposit (Rs. 1600) on 1st July (6 months = 1 half-year): A = 1600 × (1 + 2.5/100)^1 A = 1600 × 1.025 A = 1640 Interest = A - P = 1640 - 1600 = Rs. 40 Now, add the interest amounts: Total interest = Rs. 81 + Rs. 40 = Rs. 121 So, the correct answer is Option B: Rs.121."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Garland was born Frances Ethel Gumm on June 10, 1922, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. She was the youngest child of Ethel Marion (nee Milne) and Francis Avent \\"Frank\\" Gumm. Her parents were vaudevillians who settled in Grand Rapids to run a movie theater that featured vaudeville acts. She was of Irish, English, and Scottish ancestry, named after both of her parents and baptized at a local Episcopal church. \\" In 1938, she was cast in her most memorable role, as the young Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939), a film based on the 1900 children's book by L. Frank Baum. In this film, she sang the song with which she would be identified, \\"Over the Rainbow\\". Although producers Arthur Freed and Mervyn LeRoy had wanted her from the start, studio chief Mayer first tried to borrow Shirley Temple from 20th Century Fox, but they declined. Deanna Durbin was then asked, but was unavailable, resulting in Garland being cast. Garland was initially outfitted in a blonde wig for the part, but Freed and LeRoy decided against it shortly into filming. Her blue gingham dress was chosen for its blurring effect on her figure, which made her look younger. Shooting commenced on October 13, 1938, and was completed on March 16, 1939, with a final cost of more than US2 million. With the conclusion of filming, MGM kept Garland busy with promotional tours and the shooting of Babes in Arms, directed by Busby Berkeley. Rooney and she were sent on a cross-country promotional tour, culminating in the August 17 New York City premiere at the Capitol Theater, which included a five-show-a-day appearance schedule for the two stars. Garland was forced into a strict diet during filming; she was given tobacco to suppress her appetite. The Wizard of Oz was a tremendous critical success, though its high budget and promotions costs of an estimated 4 million (equivalent to 70.4 million in 2018), coupled with the lower revenue generated by discounted children's tickets, meant that the film did not make a profit until it was rereleased in the 1940s and in subsequent rereleases. At the 1939 Academy Awards ceremony, Garland received her only Academy Award, a Juvenile Award for her performances in 1939, including The Wizard of Oz and Babes in Arms. Following this recognition, she became one of MGM's most bankable stars. Did she sing any songs?","completion":"Yes, in the film The Wizard of Oz (1939), Garland sang the song \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" with which she would be identified."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As they uncover the hidden connections between their past crimes, they form an unlikely alliance to bring down the mastermind behind the organization that has wronged them and take vengeance upon its diabolical members. Act I: The movie begins with the introduction of Dick Collins, a notorious convicted murderer currently serving time in a maximum-security prison. Dick was a successful lawyer until he was accused of committing a gruesome murder of a high-profile judge, something he claims he didn't do. At the same prison, Samuel Blackwood, a charming yet dangerous criminal with a long rap sheet, has just been transferred to the same facility. Samuel, once a prominent figure in the city's crime scene, was convicted for the murder of his business partner – a crime he confesses to but maintains was a necessary act of self-defense. In prison, both Dick and Samuel feel an unexplainable connection between their crimes. After a violent and distrustful encounter in the prison yard, they are both ushered into a secret meeting that challenges their understanding of reality. They learn that, despite their different backgrounds, they are both victims of a cruel manipulative game orchestrated by a malevolent organization known as the Shadow Syndicate. Act II: The Shadow Syndicate, led by the enigmatic Mr. Gray, is comprised of highly skilled criminals, corrupt politicians, and other influential figures. The organization has ruled the city from the depths of its shadows for decades. Together, Samuel and Dick forge a plan to expose the powerful members of the Syndicate and bring down its malicious operations. Through hidden letters and code deciphering, they uncover that the murders they were convicted for were masterminded by the Syndicate to facilitate a rapid ascent in the criminal world and city politics. As this realization sinks in, the two convicted murderers vow to take vengeance upon the Syndicate, even if they must risk their own lives to do so. Act III: Facing danger from within the prison, Samuel and Dick use their unique skillsets - Samuel's criminal savvy and Dick's legal expertise - to orchestrate a daring prison break. Together, they navigate the treacherous streets of the city and infiltrate the Shadow Syndicate's hidden headquarters. During a thrilling climax, the two former convicts face down the hostile members of the Syndicate and ultimately confront the enigmatic Mr. Gray. In a critical revelation, the duo uncovers that the Syndicate was on the verge of a dangerous new plot that would have far-reaching consequences on the city. Epilogue: With the demise of the Shadow Syndicate and Mr. Gray's capture, Samuel's and Dick's crimes finally find public redemption and their names are cleared. Though they are offered the chance to start over, they remain wary, knowing that the city has many lurking shadows. The duo forms an unlikely partnership and vows to use their newfound freedom to continue protecting their city, as they know that darkness can never be completely eradicated. Beyond Shadows dives deep into themes such as trust, redemption, and the darkest corners of human nature.

I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister.

Among the possible outcomes, the one that resonates best within the context is answer A: being greeted by people at their new apartment complex. The transition from a rural lifestyle to an urban one can be challenging, but Remy's new neighbors may help ease the shift. Moving into an apartment complex is a prime opportunity for Remy to meet a diverse range of people who might be open and welcoming. After all, apartment complexes are often home to individuals from all walks of life, each with their unique experiences and backgrounds. In the early days of settling in, Remy might start meeting their neighbors in shared spaces such as the laundry room, gym, or by simply crossing paths in the common hallway. These encounters could lead to polite greetings, small talk, and, eventually, an invitation to a social gathering or community events hosted within the complex. As Remy continues to build connections with their neighbors, they might find it easier to ask for recommendations on local places to visit, such as restaurants, parks, and other attractions. This type of engagement helps Remy grow their social network and make new friends, making the big city feel a bit more familiar and welcoming. By participating in group activities and events, Remy can gradually overcome their nervousness about meeting people in the city. Meanwhile, they will discover that living in a big city offers numerous opportunities to connect with others, whether that be through local clubs, social meetups, or volunteering at community organizations.

Such encounters play an essential role in helping Remy adapt to their new urban surroundings, making connections, and thus mitigating their anxiety over meeting new people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Dr. Barden was a former winner of the game. Iris reluctantly accepts. The next day at Lambrick's manor, Iris is introduced to his son Julian and the other contestants: Lucas; Travis, a war veteran; Linda, an elderly, paralyzed woman; Peter, a gambling addict; Cal; Amy; and Conway, an alcoholic debtor. A steak and fois gras dinner is served but, Iris, a vegetarian, initially declines to eat it. Shepherd then offers her 10,000 to compromise her principles, and so she eats the steak. When Shepard realizes Conway is a recovering alcoholic, he offers Conway 10,000 to drink a glass of wine. When Conway declines he then offers him 50,000 to drink an entire decanter of Scotch. Conway accepts the 50,000 and reluctantly drinks the Scotch. After dinner ends, the game begins. Shepard reveals it to be a version of the party game \\"Would you rather...?\\", in which players must choose between two options. Shepard gives his guests the opportunity to leave without playing, but everyone stays. After Shepard's butler, a former MI5 agent named Bevans, wheels in an electric shock machine, the drunken Conway attempts to leave but is shot dead. Each contestant is then forced to choose between shocking themselves or another person. Each player has 15 seconds to make their choice. Iris, Cal and Lucas (after nodding his consent to Travis) shock themselves. All survive, and nobody is eliminated. In the second round, each contestant must choose between stabbing someone in the thigh with an ice pick or whipping Travis three times with a sjambok. Travis is singled out after insulting Julian in the previous round. In the second round the players are given 30 seconds...

Movie plot title: Atom Age Vampire Movie plot: When a singer (Susanne Loret) is horribly disfigured in a car accident, a scientist (Dr. Levin, played by Alberto Lupo) develops a treatment which can restore her beauty by injecting her with a special serum. While performing the procedure, however, he falls in love with her. As the treatment begins to fail, he determines to save her appearance, regardless of how many women he must kill for her sake. Despite the implication of its American title, the film does not feature an actual vampire. The titular Seddok is actually the brilliant but deranged scientist Dr. Levin, mutated by a chemical formula created using radiation. Dr. Levin studied the effects of radiation on living tissue in post-Hiroshima Japan, and created an imperfect and teratogenic serum, \\"Derma 25\\", which he later refined into the miraculous healing agent \\"Derma 28\\" which he uses to treat the heroine. When his supply of Derma 28 runs out, he realizes he must kill to obtain more, and injects himself with Derma 25 in order to become monstrous and remorseless, so that he may seek these victims without hesitation. Because many of the murders take place near the docks where shiploads of Japanese refugees are arriving, and leave behind the victims' bodies with holes in the neck where Dr. Levin has extracted the glands, the refugees claim that a vampire (whom they call \\"Seddok\\", though this is not a Japanese name) is responsible for the attacks. During a meeting with police, a restored-to-humanity Dr. Levin speculates that the Hiroshima survivors' tales of a mutated killer are due to psychological strain from the radiation damage to their bodies...but also wonders aloud whether the \\"vampire\\" these witnesses describe might simply be a disturbed man wishing to be normal again.

Michael Green, 74, made two 999 calls after his neck became wedged against the furniture at his home in Leicester in September. Despite his distressed state, relatives said, it took crews nearly 90 minutes to respond, by which time he was dead. Ambulance bosses said the calls were correctly handled but Mr Green's family said they will go to the ombudsman. Mr Green suffered from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and pancreatitis. In recordings released to his family by East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS), Mr Green can be heard groaning with pain in the first call. When told an ambulance may take four hours, he responds: \\"Oh dear, the trouble is me neck's going dead with being stuck on the chair, I think I need somebody quick.\\" He told the call handler he had already been stuck for about five hours. In a second call, 40 minutes later, he tells a different operator during the course of the call: \\"I feel like I'm going numb. \\"I've changed now... I'm not right...

Article:Dozens of firefighters tackled the blaze, which broke out overnight on the roof of the riverside mansion in the centre of the French capital. The building was being renovated after its purchase by a Qatari prince in 2007. Located on the World Heritage-listed Seine embankment, the mansion was once home to the 18th Century philosopher Voltaire. It took six hours for the fire brigade to put out the blaze, which started in an area below the rooftop which emergency services found difficult to access. A large portion of the roof has been destroyed. A spokesman for the fire service, Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Le Testu, said 650 square metres (7,000 sq ft) of the roof had gone, along with a section of a central staircase. Some of the brickwork on the front of the building has collapsed. Renowned fresco ceiling paintings by Charles Le Brun in the Gallery of Hercules were also \\"severely damaged by smoke and water\\", Lt Col Testu said. About a dozen neighbours were evacuated, and one firefighter was slightly injured. The mayor of Paris, Bertrand Delanoe, said the fire had shocked and saddened him. In a statement, Mr Delanoe said the city authorities would monitor renovation works at the building, which he described as a \\"significant part of Paris's heritage\\".

More than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico over the past six years as violence surged and the country's government cracked down on drug cartels. Mexico's Interior Ministry announced the staggering statistic on Tuesday but noted that authorities don't have data about how many of the disappearances are connected with organized crime. The 26,121 disappearances occurred during former President Felipe Calderon's six-year administration, which ended on December 1 when Enrique Pena Nieto assumed the presidency. Pena Nieto's government has formed a special working group to focus on finding the missing, said Lia Limon, deputy secretary of legal matters and human rights for Mexico's Interior Ministry. Locating people \\"is a priority for this government,\\" Limon told reporters. The release of the government statistics Tuesday comes several days after a report from Human Rights Watch said Mexican security forces were connected with the disappearances of at least 149 people during Calderon's tenure. \\"President Pena Nieto has inherited one of worst crises of disappearances in the history of Latin America,\\" Jose Miguel Vivanco, the organization's Americas director, said in a statement. In the northern Mexican state of Coahuila alone, officials reported nearly 2,000 disappearances between 2006 and 2012, Human Rights Watch said. Rights groups and activists have long said that forced disappearances are among the most troubling problems Mexico faces and have cautioned that reliable statistics are hard to come by because many such cases are unreported. The human toll of Mexico's drug war. Limon said Tuesday that the data federal authorities have don't specify what caused the disappearances. She said the list could include people who have emigrated out of the country or fled because of family conflicts, in addition to people who were kidnapped. Authorities will need several weeks to release data about the number of disappearances since Pena Nieto took office, she said, due to \\"inconsistencies\\" in the data. Critics have accused Mexico's government of not doing enough to find the missing and punish those responsible. In many instances, families frustrated with a sluggish response from authorities have searched themselves for missing loved ones. Read more: The 'open wounds' of Mexico's drug war. In October 2011, Calderon said the \\"very high\\" number of missing people was a growing concern. He listed them among the victims of violence that he described as \\"open wounds\\" in Mexican society. \\"We don't know the size of the problem,\\" the president said during a speech inaugurating a new prosecutor's office aimed at helping victims. Human Rights Watch said last week that it sees a ray of hope in the new administration. \\"The Pena Nieto government has been very open so far about acknowledging the scale of the problem and the work that remains for them,\\" said Nik Steinberg, a Mexico researcher for the organization. \\"The real question will be: are they ready to investigate and prosecute these cases?\\" Mexican blogger vows to fight despite threats.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario, where the bread has more dust on it, can be classified as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Allow me to explain this in detail. To revisit the process, the stages are: 1. Bread is exposed to the elements. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible. In this particular scenario, the increased amount of dust on the bread does not directly impact any of the six mentioned steps. Nonetheless, it does have an indirect effect on Step 4, \\"Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread.\\" While step 4 itself is not altered, the increased dust levels on the bread may potentially lead to a higher concentration of mold spores present on the bread's surface. This is due to the fact that dust can carry and deposit mold spores on various surfaces, including the bread in question. The higher concentration of mold spores on the bread surface, as a result of the increased dust, may in turn accelerate the rate at which the mold spreads on the bread, which could lead to faster mold growth in steps 5 and 6. Although, the approximate rate and extent of this influence may vary based on multiple external factors such as the specific types of mold spores present and the overall environmental conditions. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of having more dust on the bread can be classified as indirectly impacting a step of the process, specifically Step 4. Analogously, this increased dust presence may accelerate the mold growth rate on the bread, though the overall outcome will still be mold development and the eventual visibility of mold colonies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"\\"Never ever had anybody ask me how do you exit? <everyone laughing> It's just done for you.\\"\\" said in French?","completion":"To translate the English sentence \\"Never ever had anybody ask me how do you exit? <everyone laughing> It's just done for you.\\" into French. We need to respect the sentence structure, idiomatic expressions, the nuances of the joke, and the informal tone in French. The steps are: 1. Translating it word by word 2. Checking if the translation makes sense or if it can be improved to sound more natural in French. Word for word translation: \\"Jamais personne ne m'a demandé comment sortez-vous? <tout le monde rigole> Ça se fait just pour toi.\\" Modification in order to bring more sense and naturality: \\"Personne ne m'a jamais demandé comment on part? <tout le monde rit> Ça se fait tout seul.\\" So, the finished translation is: \\"Personne ne m'a jamais demandé comment on part? <tout le monde rit> Ça se fait tout seul.\\" Here is a step-by-step justification of the translation: - \\"Never ever\\" was translated to \\"Jamais\\" but it doesn't really feel natural in French, so we modified it by \\"Personne ne m'a jamais\\" which means \\"Nobody ever asked me\\". - \\"Had anybody ask me\\" was translated to \\"Personne ne m'a demandé\\". This construction is more natural in French while keeping the meaning of the original sentence. - \\"How do you exit?\\" was translated into \\"Comment sortez-vous?\\". Again we must find a more natural way to say this in French, so we modified it by \\"comment on part?\\", which means \\"how one leaves?\\". - \\"Everyone laughing\\" is translated as \\"tout le monde rit\\", maintaining the format in the original. - \\"It's just done for you.\\" was translated into \\"Ça se fait jusque pour toi.\\" - However, this is a word-for-word translation and doesn't sound natural in French. So, it was modified to \\"Ça se fait tout seul\\", which literally means \\"It's done by itself\\". This is a better translation since it gives the feeling that the action is automated or happens naturally without human intervention, which is the point of the original English sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3] Now, I have a new situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. Answer this question please: Which lake has colder water the bottom? A:","completion":"Based on the scenario provided, it is likely that the Shallow lake with the mixing of saline and fresh water has colder water at the bottom. In the given background, it is stated that thermoclines occur where there are sudden changes in temperature. One such example provided is when cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea. In this case, the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, resulting in a layered structure where the temperature actually rises as a diver descends. Such a scenario is described for the Shallow lake which has a mixture of saline and fresh water, hinting at a probable thermocline situation where the temperature at the bottom is colder than at the surface. On the other hand, the Deep lake is identified as being exposed to geothermal activity. According to the background provided, in lakes where geothermal activity is present, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This is due to heat from the Earth's interior warming the water from the bottom up, leading to convection currents. Therefore, despite the Deep lake having more instances of divers having problems due to thermoclines, its bottom water temperature is likely warmer due to geothermal inputs. Hence, it should be the Shallow lake that has colder water at the bottom because of the layered structure created by the mixing of saline and fresh water. However, it is essential to consider that are other factors that can influence water temperature such as the overall climate, the season, the amount of sunlight it receives, wind, etc. A precise answer would require more specific data about the lakes."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question.

The Lions opened the scoring in the first quarter via a 27-yard field goal from Matt Prater. Detroit extended their lead in the second quarter via a one-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Theo Riddick. The Saints reduced the Lions lead to seven points via a 40-yard field goal from Wil Lutz. The two teams exchanged field goals, one from Prater from 29 yards, and one from Lutz from 32 yards, making the score 13-6 in favor of the Lions at halftime. The Lions added two field goals from Prater in the third quarter, from 32 yards and 27 yards out, extending their lead to 19-6. The Saints opened the scoring in the fourth quarter with a one-yard touchdown run from John Kuhn. The Lions responded on the next drive with a 66-yard touchdown pass from Stafford to Golden Tate, which was followed by a failed two-point conversion. Matt Prater finished the scoring with a 52-yard field goal, giving the Lions a 28-13 win. This marked the first game all year in which the Lions never trailed in the fourth quarter, and their first game of 2016 to be decided by more than seven points. The Lions defense held Saints quarterback Drew Brees without a touchdown pass, ending a streak of 60 straight home games in which Brees threw for at least one touchdown. Further, the Lions won a road game following their Thanksgiving Day game for the first time since 1974, ending a streak of 22 losses in such games.

The shift of a demand curve takes place when there is a change in any non-price determinant of demand, resulting in a new demand curve. Non-price determinants of demand are those things that will cause demand to change even if prices remain the same--in other words, the things whose changes might cause a consumer to buy more or less of a good even if the good's own price remained unchanged. Some of the more important factors are the prices of related goods (both substitutes and complements), income, population, and expectations. However, demand is the willingness and ability of a consumer to purchase a good under the prevailing circumstances; so, any circumstance that affects the consumer's willingness or ability to buy the good or service in question can be a non-price determinant of demand. As an example, weather could be a factor in the demand for beer at a baseball game. Is the following statement correct based on the text does an increase in income shifts the demand curve","completion":"Yes, the statement is correct based on the text. An increase in income is mentioned as one of the non-price determinants of demand.

New research shows that contamination of just a single doorknob can help spread germs throughout office buildings, hotels or health care facilities within hours. Researchers applied samples of a virus to surfaces such as doorknobs and tabletops and found that, within two to four hours, the virus had been picked up by 40 to 60 percent of workers and visitors in the facilities and could be detected on many commonly touched objects. Handshake vs. fist bump: Which spreads more germs? In the study, the investigators used a virus called bacteriophage MS-2 as a surrogate for the human norovirus -- the most common cause of the stomach flu -- as the two viruses are similar in shape, size and resistance to disinfectants. The researchers placed the tracer virus on one or two surfaces -- a doorknob, a tabletop or both -- at the beginning of the day. Then a few hours later, they tested various surfaces in the building such as other doorknobs, light switches, bed rails, phones and computer equipment for the virus, and found the germs had spread widely. Fortunately, the researchers say that there seems to be an easy solution to the contamination issue: disinfectant wipes. \\"Using disinfecting wipes containing quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) registered by EPA as effective against viruses like norovirus and flu, along with hand hygiene, reduced virus spread by 80 to 99 percent,\\" study author Charles Gerba of the University of Arizona, Tucson, said in a statement. Each year, norovirus causes an estimated 19 to 21 million illnesses and contributes to 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and up to 800 deaths. Touching surfaces or objects contaminated with norovirus, and then touching your mouth, is a common source of infection. The CDC recommends that, to prevent a norovirus infection, your should wash your hands with soap and water, especially after using the toilet and changing diapers, and always before eating, preparing, or handling food. The agency also stresses that alcohol-based hand sanitizers can be used in addition to hand washing; however, they should not be used as a substitute for this basic practice. The new research was presented Monday at the 54th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC) in Washington, DC. ||||| (Matt McClain for The Washington Post) Viruses can spread from a single doorknob to 40 to 60 percent of surfaces and people in a building in just a few hours, according to a new study. Researchers put a tracer virus on one or two surfaces in a building (for example a doorknob or push plate) at the beginning of the day. And after two to four hours, the virus could be detected on a majority of commonly touched surfaces such as light switches, coffee pot handles, phones and computers. \\"We actually put a virus on a push plate in an office building of 80 people, had three entrances, and within four hours it ended up on over half the people's hands, and it ended up on over half the surfaces that people touched in that building,\\" said University of Arizona researcher Charles Gerba, who presented the study at the 54th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy on Monday. \\"What we really learned was the hand is quicker than the sneeze in the spread of disease,\\" Gerba said during his presentation. The alarming speed which which the virus goes from a surface to the hands of anyone -- workers and visitors in office buildings, schools, hotels and hospitals -- serves as an important reminder to wash hands and disinfect surfaces frequently. Viruses such as diarrhea, the flu and the common cold can cause illness when people have the viruses on their hands and then touch their faces, which they do about once every three to four minutes, according to Gerba. Gerba said that hand washing, disinfecting wipes, and hand sanitizer use was found to significantly reduce the spread of a virus. \\"Using disinfecting wipes containing quaternary ammonium compounds (QUATS) registered by EPA as effective against viruses like norovirus and flu, along with hand hygiene, reduced virus spread by 80 to 99 percent,\\" he said. Touch was found to spread the virus in places where people might least expect it. It wasn't the bathroom, but the break room that was a \\"hot spot\\" for virus spread. \\"What's the first thing you do when you go to work? You get a cup of coffee. You want to be the first one in that coffee break room,\\" Gerba said. \\"Every time you touch these surfaces you're picking up between 30 and 50 percent of the organisms who are on that surface.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Contamination of just a single doorknob can help spread germs throughout office buildings, hotels, or healthcare facilities within hours.

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

In this question, the user is concerned about their girlfriend meeting up with a guy and wants to meet the guy too, potentially to be more comfortable with the situation. Step 2: Reflect on potential consequences. Meeting the guy could help the user feel more at ease and build trust in their relationship. On the other hand, asking to meet the guy could give the impression that the user doesn't trust their girlfriend. Step 3: Provide perspective. It is not inherently wrong to ask your girlfriend to meet someone she goes out to dinner with, as long as your intentions are to strengthen trust and understanding in the relationship. It is important to communicate openly and honestly with your girlfriend about your feelings and your request. Second question: What do I do to get the admit card for KVPY?

Question: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Please answer a question about the following article about Software testing: There are many approaches available in software testing. Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections are referred to as static testing, whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as dynamic testing. Static testing is often implicit, as proofreading, plus when programming tools/text editors check source code structure or compilers (pre-compilers) check syntax and data flow as static program analysis. Dynamic testing takes place when the program itself is run. Dynamic testing may begin before the program is 100% complete in order to test particular sections of code and are applied to discrete functions or modules. Typical techniques for this are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment.

Write some highlights for the following article: After dealing with porcupine creatures, shape-shifters and planes full of crystallized bodies over five seasons, star John Noble is still having the time of his life on \\"Fringe.\\" The cult favorite sci-fi series is in the midst of its final season on Fox, and classic episodes premiere Tuesday night on the Science Channel. Noble, who plays the brilliant (and occasionally mad) scientist Walter Bishop, recently spoke with CNN about his experience with the show and what fans can look forward to in the remaining episodes, leading up to a January 18 series finale. CNN: Are you nearing the end of filming now? Noble: My goodness, yes. We start filming our penultimate episode Tuesday morning. We're very close to the end, mate. CNN: And what's that feeling like? Noble: It just feels like an awful lot of work (laughs). We've still got a bit to do. It's an exciting thing feeling it all come together. There's a sense of closeness among the crew. We're here in Vancouver; it's our fourth year and, for the cast, our fifth year together. It's a bit odd. We are friends, so it's a bit sad. CNN: Meanwhile, you're getting a second life on the Science Channel. Noble: The thing about Science Channel is that they know \\"Fringe,\\" and they love it. The people I know there have watched from the beginning. It's not just another product. They've brought people in to talk about the science of it. We're in a very good second home. CNN: This season, do you feel that Walter is bearing the weight of a tremendous amount of pressure to put together this plan to fight the Observers? Noble: Yes, but I think the pressure's on everyone. All the key players have to come to some sort of conclusion, and that's the gift of these last 13 episodes. Every character is under pressure, if you can call it that. But it's a good journey. Every episode takes us further on the track to the finale. It's like writing a novel and having the chance to write the final chapter. The stakes are lifted every week for us. It's kind of exciting. CNN: We've seen so many major twists just this season. What was your reaction to learning that Peter was going to utilize the tech of an Observer and sort of become one himself? Noble: Well, it's pretty inspired, really. If you can't beat them, join them. Peter realized to combat these people, he would have to be on equal terms with them. It also gave Joshua Jackson a marvelous journey, which I think he's done splendidly. The fun thing is that both men are struggling with their arrogance and hubris in different ways. It's a very interesting story arc to play as well. You have Walter not trying to be so smart and cruel, and Peter wanting to be more so. So that's playing out really well. CNN: The show took a short break in shooting this season, as you had to take some time to take care of yourself. Are you doing better now? Noble: I'm doing very well, mate. We decided we needed to address an ongoing issue, which been going on a long time for me, which is that I don't sleep. Ultimately, given the load of travel, I was starting to hit a wall. We did what we could to correct that. We probably really didn't need to take as much time as we did. The management was terrific and said, \\"Get it sorted out.\\" We're still going strong at this stage, so something worked. CNN: Have you enjoyed discovering Twitter? Noble: I thought it was time I got with it. (Laughs) I resisted for so long. I have no idea, to be honest, what I'm doing. I just go on every once in a while and say something, and it gets retweeted 6,000 times. It's an astonishing way of communicating. Thank God for that, because it takes away the tyranny of those who would withhold information. I remember I tweeted, \\"Just saying g'bye to Georgina Haig. Lovely woman!\\" I just had afternoon tea with Georgina (whose character died in a recent episode). That was taken as, she's gone forever. At that stage, she was still on the show, so I thought \\"What have I done?\\" I knew she was gone! You've gotta be careful! (Laughs) CNN: Walter is famous for his love of junk food. Do you have a favorite junk food on or off set? Noble: To survive, I try not to eat junk food. I hate to destroy the myth! On a film set, if you eat junk food, you'd finish around 400 pounds at the end of the first season. That's just the nature of the work. To destroy another myth, we don't actually eat it, because we can't. In 40 takes, you'd be absolutely bloated with Red Vines or whatever else you're having. We go through the motions of it and then have to get rid of it to so we can do another take. There was a bacon sandwich I thought was rather nice ... CNN: And what can fans expect as it comes to a close? Noble: I haven't read the final episode yet, but I know that (executive producer) Joel Wyman has put everything, and I mean everything, he's got into this. He's directing the last episode. I think it will be a masterpiece. I haven't read it, but I can't imagine anything less with the amount of heart he's put into it. Fingers crossed, but that's my prediction.

Definition: In this task you need to give reasons to justify the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. Write the sentence in natural language. Input: Sentence: The fish ate the worm. It was tasty. Question: Why does the 'It' refer to the worm? Output:","completion":"The task asks you to provide reasons to justify the pronoun coreference relations in a given sentence. In simple terms, you need to explain why the target pronoun ('it' in this case) refers to a specific noun phrase (the worm). 1. Read the provided sentence and identify the target pronoun: In this case, the sentence is \\"The fish ate the worm. It was tasty\\" and the target pronoun is \\"It\\". 2. Read the question to identify the noun phrase candidate: The question asks, \\"Why does the 'it' refer to the worm?\\" 3. Analyze the sentence and use your knowledge of common sense to find connections between the target pronoun and the noun phrase candidate. You can use one or more aspects of common sense knowledge, such as property, object, eventuality, spatial, quantity, or any other relevant knowledge. 4. In this example, the knowledge of eventuality can be used. The action 'ate' happens before 'tasty,' which means that the fish tasted something – in this case, the worm. 5. Write the explanation in a clear and natural language: The pronoun 'It' refers to the worm because the event of the fish eating the worm precedes the statement about something being tasty.

Despite this, their need for water is not as significant as that of fish, who reside in water and rely on it for their respiration, reproduction, and locomotion. For a more in-depth look at organisms that require large amounts of water to survive, aquatic life is an excellent starting point. This category includes various species of fish, mammals, plants, and invertebrates, all of which need water as their primary habitat and fundamental aspect of their biology and ecology. Fish, for example, use water as their respiratory medium. They extract oxygen from water through their gills, which allow them to breathe and continue essential biological processes. Furthermore, water provides fish with buoyancy, enabling them to move efficiently without expending too much energy. Aquatic mammals, like whales and dolphins, also depend on water for their survival. While they breathe air, their body is specially adapted to living in water, and they need it to maintain adequate body temperature, find food, and reproduce. Aquatic plants, such as seagrasses and algae, need water for photosynthesis, respiration, nutrient uptake, and reproduction. In turn, these plants contribute to the marine ecosystem by providing habitat for many organisms, acting as primary producers in the food chain, and producing oxygen. Finally, invertebrates, such as coral, jellyfish, and other marine species, also depend heavily on water for survival. Most invertebrates live in water to maintain structural integrity, reproduce, find food, and carry out other vital life functions. In summary, the correct answer to the question \\"what requires great amounts of water to survive?\\" based on the provided information would be \\"fish.\\" However, it's crucial to recognize that various other organisms, particularly aquatic life, also depend on copious amounts of water for their survival, including plants, mammals, and invertebrates."},{"prompt":"Jan told her friends that she did not wanna go to the party.

A Wyoming man was charged Friday with four counts of first-degree murder after, authorities say, he shot dead three of his children and another relative inside his home. According to the warrant for his arrest, Everett E. Conant III is also charged with attempted first-degree murder, aggravated battery and possession of a deadly weapon with unlawful intent. Magistrate Scott Cole ordered Conant held with no bond, following his arraignment Friday afternoon in Platte County. In addition to the four dead, law enforcement said that Conant shot and injured an adult woman -- identified in court records as Suzette Ann Conant, the suspect's wife. Wheatland Police Officer Doug Wiggins wrote in a criminal affidavit that he encountered the woman on the street shortly after 5 p.m. Thursday, soon after he'd arrived to investigate a report of screaming and shots fired. The woman, who had been shot in the leg and shoulder, identified her husband as the shooter and said her children may have been shot as well, according to the affidavit. She said that Conant was still in the house and armed. Wiggins said he then confronted the suspect through a doorway, at one point observing something black in his hand during the conversation as well as \\"what appeared to be a lifeless body of a male juvenile on the couch, surrounded by blood,\\" the affidavit said. The suspect -- later identified as Conant -- was coaxed out of the home, unarmed, after about 10 minutes and was arrested \\"without incident.\\" More officers from Wheatland and the Platte County Sheriff's Office then arrived and went through the house. There, they found the dead bodies of three minors -- who were born between 1993 and 1999, according to charging documents, which did not identify them by name or birthdate. Another adult male, 33-year-old Nacuma Roland Conant, was found shot and struggling to survive. Officers began efforts to try to save the man's life, but he was later pronounced dead at Platte County Memorial Hospital, according to the affidavit from Wiggins. The incident occurred in Wheatland, a town of about 2,400 people that is located about 70 miles north of Cheyenne. Convictions of any of the four first-degree murder charges are punishable, potentially, by the death penalty. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? unless you 're an absolute raving star wars junkie","completion":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"unless you're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie\\" can be interpreted as leaning towards a negative or neutral viewpoint. The statement implies that the film may not appeal to a broader audience or casual viewers, and only those who are hardcore, fervent fans of the Star Wars franchise would be able to appreciate or find enjoyment in it. The use of the term \\"absolute raving\\" gives emphasis to the level of devotion and fanaticism toward the Star Wars series that a person must possess before enjoying the film. While it does not blatantly insult the film, the sentence suggests that its appeal is limited, and may not cater to everyone's tastes or expectations in a movie experience. The sentiment, in this case, is not overly strong in its negativity, but it also doesn't lean towards a positive evaluation of the movie. The critical view of the sentence is focused more on the audience the film might be suited for, rather than making a direct judgment on the movie's quality itself. However, it's essential to understand that while the sentiment of this single sentence seems negative or neutral, evaluating the entire movie review would provide a fuller picture of the critic's perspective on the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The American Hockey League (AHL) is a 30-team professional ice hockey league based in the United States and Canada that serves as the primary developmental league for the National Hockey League (NHL). Since the 2010–11 season, every team in the league has an affiliation agreement with one NHL team. When NHL teams do not have an AHL affiliate, players are assigned to AHL teams affiliated with other NHL teams. Twenty-six AHL teams are located in the United States and the remaining four are in Canada. The league offices are located in Springfield, Massachusetts, and its current president is David Andrews. The annual playoff champion is awarded the Calder Cup, named for Frank Calder, the first President (1917–1943) of the NHL. The reigning champions are the Grand Rapids Griffins. The AHL traces its origins directly to two predecessor professional leagues: the Canadian-American Hockey League (the \\"Can-Am\\" League), founded in 1926, and the first International Hockey League, established in 1929. Although the Can-Am League never operated with more than six teams, the departure of the Boston Bruin Cubs after the 1935–36 season reduced it down to just four member clubs – Springfield Indians, Philadelphia Ramblers, Providence Reds, and New Haven Eagles – for the first time in its history.

Given the question: At school, besides cheating on a test, a kid might cheat in other ways. They might steal someone else's idea for a science project, or copy a book report from the Internet and hand it in as if it's his or her work. Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even though there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test need to talk with the teacher or another grown-up. They can find some ways to help solve this problem. Talking about the problem and working it out will make him or her feel better than cheating. Kids who cheat may feel worried about getting caught. Whether they are caught or not, these kids may feel _ or embarrassed. Even if they feel fine or don't get caught, that doesn't mean it's OK. There's an old saying that cheaters never win and winners never cheat. This may sound difficult to understand, because sometimes it seems like cheaters do win--- at least for the moment. However, sooner or later, they'll pay the price. It's just a matter of time only. And kids who don't cheat are true winners because, when they win, they do it honestly.

You will become infectious with your good attitude and earn larger tips. People are proven to tip higher when they feel a social connection with their server, as if they could be friends. The best way to cultivate this attitude is to enjoy your work and interactions with others. A big, open-lipped smile can increase tips up to 140%. Take some time to get presentable before arriving to work. A dirty waiter or waitress is unpleasant to look at and reflects poorly on you and the restaurant. Wash your apron and uniform, and make an effort to wear nice clothes when at work. While attractiveness hasn't been proven to increase tips for male waiters, effort and cleanliness definitely does. Women should wear a little basic make-up to earn more tips, as a French study showed that 50% more men left tips to waitresses wearing make-up than those wearing none. Unfortunately, more attractive women have been proven to get higher tips than less, but you should exploit this fact for your own benefit as well. The same study found that adding a bit of personality to your outfit, like a flower or button, increased tips by roughly 15%. For women, this is particularly noticeable when wearing something in your hair. In order to build connections with customers, and thus increase your tips, be sure to let the table know your name. When you arrive, say hello and let them know your name before launching into the specials. Waitstaff who introduced themselves earned roughly 2 more per bill. If the table offers you their names, be sure to remember them and use them. The best way to do this is when you get the check. When returning a credit or debit card, be sure to thank the name on the card when handing over the check -- it's been shown to increase tips. When people feel treated or gifted upon, they generally try to \\"pay back\\" the person being generous to them. Even writing a simple \\"Thank You\\" on the back of a check was shown to increase tips, and simple smiley faces and pictures help as well. Being kind and generous during the meal can create the same effect. If someone spills something, or an order doesn't come out perfectly, you should offer to rectify the situation for them as best you can. This is especially crucial when it is busy or the restaurant is filling up. While you should always be kind and courteous, you want people to eat, pay, and move on so that you can get a new table, and thus a new tip. To do this, come collect the dishes once everyone has finished eating, and ask about further courses (like dessert) instead of waiting for them to ask you. Summary:","completion":"Being a genuinely happy server with a positive attitude can result in higher tips due to the social connection that customers feel with their server. To achieve this, maintain cleanliness, wear presentable clothes, and consider adding a personal touch to your outfit. Female servers may benefit from wearing makeup, as studies show it can increase tips. Introducing yourself to customers and remembering their names can create a stronger bond, potentially increasing your tips by around 2 per bill. Always strive to provide excellent service, rectify any issues during the meal, and be efficient in clearing the table and suggesting additional courses to keep customers satisfied. Demonstrating kindness and gratitude, such as writing a \\"Thank You\\" note on the check, can further increase tips and enhance the dining experience for customers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Barbara Holper was the daughter of Hieronymus Holper, under whom Albrecht the Elder served his apprenticeship as a goldsmith. The two men became friends, and when she came of age Holper gave his daughter into marriage when Dürer senior was 40 and she was 15. The couple were compatible, well-matched and fond of each other. Yet their son's writings detail their difficult lives and many setbacks; three of their 18 children survived into adulthood – 17 of whom had been born by the time of this portrait. After her husband died Barbara was destitute and went to live with her son. After she in turn died in 1514, her son wrote \\"This my pious Mother ... often had the plague and many other severe and strange illnesses, and she suffered great poverty, scorn, contempt, mocking words, terrors, and great adversities. Yet she bore no malice. Also she died hard ... I felt so grieved for her that I cannot express it.\\" Barbara is shown wearing a red dress and a matte white bonnet which fully covers her hair, indicating her marital status. Her headdress is draped with a long scarf or train which stretches down her neck and across her left shoulder, contrasting in colour and shape against the black head-wear of her husband. The lines of her face contain touches of white paint to give a highlighting and enlivening effect; they are especially evident around her eyes, the bridge of her nose and around her upper lip. Barbara was attractive in her youth; her son described her as having been \\"comely and of erect bearing\\". However, by the time of this portrait the effects of time and losing so many children weigh heavily on her face. The panel was grounded with white paint, while the composition seems to have changed significantly from the imprimatura. Faint traces of the original figuration are visible in parts of the background and in the darkened areas of her hood.

Process: - The organism must die to begin the process - The soft tissue decomposes - The bones are left behind - Scavengers tear the body apart and move the bones elsewhere - Wind and rain also scatter the bones further - The bones left behind will weather and become buried by sand and soil - The proteins in the bone are replaced with minerals that are dissolved in the soil - This creates a rock-like substance called a fossil - Water and wind erosion wear away the layers of soil on top of the fossil - This makes discovery of the fossil possible. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose fewer organisms die happens, how will it affect more bones are left behind. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process you described involves the transformation of an organism's remains into fossils through various stages such as decomposition, scattering, and mineralization. The perturbation hypothesis, which considers a scenario where fewer organisms die, could indeed have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Direct effects: 1. Fewer bones to form fossils: If there are fewer organisms dying, there will be a direct reduction in the number of bones available to undergo the fossilization process, leading to fewer fossils being formed. 2. Less diverse range of specimens: Since fewer organisms are available to become fossils, the range of specimens available for fossilization would decrease, potentially affecting the variety of fossils that could be formed and ultimately discovered. Indirect effects: 1. Scavenger and decomposer populations: The organisms responsible for breaking down and scattering the remains of dead organisms might be negatively affected by a reduced supply of resources to scavenge or decompose. This could lead to a decrease in the decomposer and scavenger populations, which in turn might slow down the overall process of fossil formation. 2. Competition among organisms: A decrease in the number of dead organisms could potentially affect competition among living organisms, leading to changes in the ecological structure and potentially affecting the overall distribution and success of various species. 3. Ecosystem feedback loops: Fewer organisms dying could impact the ecosystem's balance of nutrients and energy flow, potentially disrupting various feedback loops. This might indirectly impact fossil formation as it influences the overall conditions in which the remains of organisms undergo these crucial stages. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis that contemplates fewer organisms dying would have direct and indirect effects on the process of fossil formation. The most noticeable effects would include a reduction in the numbers and diversity of fossils being formed, potential changes in the ecological structure, and disruption of the overall ecosystem's balance."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

When his grandmother passes away, Carlitos decides that he cannot live with his aunt and uncle, so he finds the two coyotes. Though he successfully crosses the border without being caught, the car that he hides in is towed away and he is separated from the two coyotes since they had parking violations and expired tags and didn't pay for them.

It is hard to quit smoking tobacco but Felicia succeeded while Samantha failed, as Felicia has a strong will power. This admirable trait of determination and self-discipline allowed Felicia to overcome the numerous challenges that often come with breaking free from the shackles of such a deeply ingrained habit. Recognizing its detrimental effects on her health and overall well-being, Felicia made it her mission to transform her life for the better. Embarking on this journey, Felicia began by seeking out the most effective quitting strategies and researched extensively about the physiological and psychological aspects of nicotine addiction. Her strong will power enabled her to maintain focus and commitment towards finding ways to manage cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Felicia utilized various tools to combat her nicotine dependence, including nicotine replacement therapy, counseling, and enlisting the support of family and friends. When faced with tempting situations or triggers, it was Felicia's unwavering dedication and resilience that ensured she didn't succumb to the urge to smoke. In contrast, Samantha, who also sought to quit smoking, was unable to channel the same level of will power to overcome the addiction. In spite of her efforts, Samantha struggled in navigating the emotional and physical challenges of quitting, as her resolve was not strong enough to resist the powerful hold that smoking continued to have on her life. While both Felicia and Samantha embarked on similar paths to kick their smoking habit, it was Felicia's indomitable will power that made all the difference in conquering this personal battle. Her ability to persevere and remain steadfast in her quest towards a smoke-free existence serves as an inspiration to others who may be grappling with their own nicotine addiction. Ultimately, the contrast between Felicia and Samantha's experiences emphasizes the significance of having a strong will power when attempting to overhaul one's life for the better. Such internal strength can be the deciding factor in whether or not an individual triumphs over life's many obstacles, especially when it comes to tackling harmful habits or overcoming addiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Originally published May 1, 2014 at 3:22 PM | Page modified May 1, 2014 at 6:16 PM Washington’s attorney general, calling it “the first consumer-protection lawsuit in the nation involving crowdfunding,” sued a Tennessee firm that got 25,000 from backers but delivered nothing, Washington’s attorney general is taking consumer protection to the next frontier: crowdfunding. The state’s top lawyer, Bob Ferguson, said Thursday his office has filed the first consumer-protection complaint in the U.S. to target a Kickstarter fraud. The lawsuit alleges Edward Polchlopek III and his company, Nashville, Tenn-based Altius Management, in 2012 raised more than 25,000 from 810 people in order to print a deck of “retro-horror”-themed cards designed by a Serbian artist. Among those backers were 31 living in Washington state, according to the suit, which was filed in King County Superior Court. Altius’ fundraising campaign promised backers that in exchange they would receive playing cards and other freebies, such as poker chips, dice and “even a costume straitjacket,” the complaint alleges. But two years later, the attorney general said, not a single backer has received what was promised, and no money was returned. The suit seeks restitution of the cash, as well as fines up to 2,000 per backer for violations of the Consumer Protection Act, meaning the total could top 1.6 million. The move targets a relatively small fundraising effort. But it serves as a caveat emptor to potential donors amid the growing popularity of Kickstarter and other crowdfunding methods, which allow small businesses and individuals to raise cash from hundreds or thousands of backers to pursue a passion or a business project. Some 28 million has gone to projects in Seattle since Kickstarter’s inception, the company said in March. A recent survey of local Kickstarter projects showed pleas that ranged from buying new seats for a movie theater to funding a sci-fi novel dubbed “The Non-Zombie Apocalypse.” Kickstarter’s website says 3 million people contributed 480 million last year to thousands of projects. Those included classrooms being built from shipping containers, a human-powered helicopter and the visit of two rappers to North Korea. “Consumers need to be aware that crowdfunding is not without risk,” Ferguson said in a statement. “This lawsuit sends a clear message to people seeking the public’s money: Washington state will not tolerate crowdfunding theft.” Polchlopek, who according to the suit is also known as Ed Nash, didn’t return a call requesting comment. On his company website, he is described as an entertainment-business expert who began his career at age 9 after writing a letter to a radio station, a move that earned him a co-host spot. Altius Management bills itself on its website as a “full-service entertainment and artist management firm” with a “world-class” management team. A spokesman for Kickstarter said the company wants “every backer to have an amazing experience, and we’re frustrated when they don’t. We hope this process brings resolution and clarity to the backers of this project.” Ángel González: 206-464-2250 or agonzalez@seattletimes.com.

Modificările ar putea viza aspecte precum rolul și funcționarea instituțiilor publice și a celor democratice, sistemul politic, protecția și garantarea drepturilor și libertăților fundamentale ale cetățenilor, precum și adaptarea legislației naționale la acquis-ul european și la respectivele standarde internaționale. De asemenea, aceste modificări ar putea fi influențate și de contextul geopolitic în care se află Bulgaria, care ca membră a Uniunii Europene și a NATO, își asumă responsabilități și obligații în promovarea valorilor și principiilor democratice, precum și în menținerea securității și stabilității în regiune. În acest proces de revizuire constituțională, dialogul și coexistența dintre diferitele forțe politice și sociale, precum și participarea activă și implicarea cetățenilor, se dovedesc a fi esențiale pentru elaborarea și adoptarea unor soluții echilibrate și eficiente, care să permită o bună funcționare a instituțiilor statului și o mai bună respectare a drepturilor și libertăților cetățenilor. Prin urmare, modificările care urmează să fie aduse Constituției Bulgariei vor fi un pas important în consolidarea bazei juridice și instituționale a acestui stat, precum și în garantarea unei conviețuiri democratice, a respectului pentru drepturile fundamentale și a valorilor europene comune."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where do Cole and Railly decide to go before the plague? Title: Twelve Monkeys Movie plot: A deadly virus wipes out almost all of humanity in 1996, forcing remaining survivors to live underground. A mysterious group known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is believed to be behind the virus. In 2035, James Cole (Willis) is a prisoner living in a subterranean shelter beneath the ruins of Philadelphia. Cole is selected for a mission, where he is trained and sent back in time to collect information on the virus in order to help scientists develop a cure.[3] Meanwhile, Cole is troubled by recurring dreams involving a foot chase and an airport shooting. Cole arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested, then hospitalized in a mental institution on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly (Stowe). There he encounters Jeffrey Goines (Pitt), a fellow mental patient with fanatical views. After an escape attempt, Cole is locked in a cell, but soon disappears, returning to the future. Back in his own time, Cole is interviewed by the scientists, who play a distorted voicemail message which discloses the location of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and asserts their association with the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved, including Goines. He is given a second chance to go back in time, but another error results in him arriving at a battlefield of World War I. He is wounded in the leg and then suddenly sent to 1996. In 1996, Railly gives a lecture about the Cassandra complex to a group of scientists. At the post-lecture book signing, Dr. Peters (Morse) questions her about mankind's sustainability on earth and points out that humanity's gradual destruction of the environment may be the real lunacy. Cole arrives at the venue after seeing flyers publicizing it, and when Railly departs, he kidnaps her and forces her to take him to Philadelphia. They learn that Goines is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and set out in search of him. When they confront him, however, Goines denies any involvement with the virus and says that wiping out humanity was... Answer:","completion":"Philadelphia"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

The only difference between the two questions is the location; one asks for a hotel in Gavi Hill-station, while the other asks for one in Ooty Hill-station. For Gavi Hill-station: While it is difficult to point out a specific hotel that guarantees complete privacy and no harassment, there are a few options in Gavi Hill-station that unmarried couples could consider. One such option would be the Green Mansion. This hotel has positive reviews and is known for its warm hospitality and privacy that it offers to its guests. It is always advisable for couples to keep their identification documents (such as Aadhar card, driver's license, or passport) handy to avoid any issues with law enforcement and hotel authorities. For Ooty Hill-station: Similar to Gavi Hill-station, pointing out a specific hotel with guaranteed no harassment is not possible. However, there are some reputable choices in Ooty Hill-station for unmarried couples. A popular option for couples is the Sterling Ooty Fern Hill, which is well-reviewed for its hospitality, ambience, and privacy for guests. Again, ensure that you have your identification documents with you during the stay to avoid any issues.

Jam should just be a moment to cool very easily by so that the pieces of fruit lingers in the liquid Add punctuation","completion":"Jam should just be a moment to cool, very easily, so that the pieces of fruit linger in the liquid. Making jam is a wonderful culinary adventure that can capture the essence of ripe, seasonal fruit for enjoyment throughout the year. The process of jam-making involves cooking ripe fruit with sugar, often with the addition of lemon juice as a natural pectin agent, until the mixture reaches a thick, gel-like consistency. To achieve the desired texture, with tender pieces of fruit suspended in a beautifully set, liquid base, it is crucial to allow the jam to cool at the correct stage. The process of making jam begins with selecting the best quality fruit. It is important to use fruit that is at its peak of ripeness, as it will have the most intense flavor and the right balance of natural sugars and acidity. The fruit should be washed and prepped, with any stems and seeds removed, as necessary. At this point, the fruit can be chopped into smaller pieces, depending on the desired chunkiness of the final product. The fruit is then cooked gently with sugar and lemon juice, if needed, in a large, wide saucepan. The sugar serves not only to sweeten the jam but also acts as a preservative to keep it from spoiling. The lemon juice is added for its natural acidity and pectin, which helps to set the jam. As the fruit cooks and releases its juices, it will become soft, and the mixture will begin to thicken. When the mixture starts to bubble, it is necessary to stir it frequently to prevent it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. At this stage, the jam will still be quite liquid, but as it continues to cook, the sugar will caramelize and the natural pectin in the fruit will become more concentrated, helping the jam to further thicken. The timing of when to remove the jam from the heat is crucial, as this will greatly impact the texture of the finished product. If the jam cools too early, it may be overly watery and may not set properly; if it cools too late, it may be overly stiff, without the desired tender chunks of fruit. It is important to remain attentive when making jam and observe its progress to achieve the perfect consistency. One method to test the setting point of the jam is by using the \\"wrinkle test.\\" Place a small plate in the freezer before you begin making jam. When you think the jam might be done, take a small spoonful and place it on the cold plate. Allow it to cool for a moment, then push your finger through the jam. If it wrinkles and holds its shape, it is ready to be removed from the heat. If not, continue cooking the jam and test again in a few minutes. Once the proper consistency is reached, remove the pan from the heat, and allow the jam to cool for a moment. During this brief cooling period, the pieces of fruit will have an opportunity to linger within the liquid, ensuring they remain tender and suspended throughout the jam. Then, the jam can be transferred to clean, sterilized jars, sealed, and stored for future enjoyment. In summary, the process of making jam requires patience, attention to detail, and adequate cooling. By carefully observing the consistency of the mixture and allowing it to cool at the right moment, the resulting jam will have the perfect balance of tender fruit pieces, suspended in a beautifully set, liquid base."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1909 Nicaraguan President José Santos Zelaya of the Liberal Party faced opposition from the Conservative Party, led by governor Juan José Estrada of Bluefields who received support from the U.S. government. The United States had limited military presence in Nicaragua, having only one patrolling U.S. Navy ship off the coast of Bluefields, in order to protect the lives and interests of American citizens who lived there. The Conservative Party sought to overthrow Zelaya which led to Estrada's rebellion in December 1909. Two Americans, Leonard Groce and Lee Roy Cannon, were captured and indicted for allegedly joining the rebellion and the laying of mines. Zelaya ordered the execution of the two Americans, which severed U.S. relations. The forces of Chamorro and Nicaraguan General Juan Estrada, each leading conservative revolts against Zelaya's government, had captured three small towns on the border with Costa Rica and were fomenting open rebellion in the capital of Managua. U.S. Naval warships that had been waiting off Mexico and Costa Rica moved into position. The protected cruisers USS Des Moines , USS Tacoma , and collier USS Hannibal lay in the harbor at Bluefields, Nicaragua, on the Atlantic coast with USS Prairie en route for Colón, Panama, with 700 Marines. On December 12, 1909, Albany with 280 bluejackets and the gunboat USS Yorktown with 155, arrived at Corinto, Nicaragua, to join the gunboat USS Vicksburg with her crew of 155 to protect American citizens and property on the Pacific coast of Nicaragua.

Back home we refer to carbonated drinks as cold drinks. So, when he asked me to have a pop,I thought he was referring to popcorn. I said,very politely,\\"No,thank you.I am not hungry.\\" He had a puzzled look on his face, one that I did not figure out for at least a week or so until somebody pointed out to me that pop meant soda and had nothing to do with corn. Speaking of pop,my very first night at Winona State University,Bangladeshi students took me to a restaurant named Papa John's. I ordered my meal and finally asked for a Pepsi.The waitress handed me an aluminum can. Now,back home we have only bottled pop drinks,and the only time I was exposed to a can was on an airplane. However,those cans were a bit different because one could open it by pulling on the tab,which came off.Imagine my embarrassment as I tried to use the same technique at the restaurant.Obviously,the tab would not come off when I struggled with the can,and I spilled the pop all over the table. My fellow Bangladeshi students and a few others at the nearby tables got a good laugh out of this.Finally,one of them showed me how to use that device.

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 5 mg/m3 over a 15-minute period. Asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving, roofing, and other applications. In examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined that it is the application parameters, predominantly temperature, that effect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazard/risk of the asphalt emissions. In particular, temperatures greater than 199 °C (390 °F), were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures, such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement. What is the nationally set limit for exposure of asphalt in a 15 minute period?","completion":"The nationally set limit for exposure to asphalt in a 15-minute period, as recommended by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), is 5 mg/m3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there are minor differences in the way the information is presented. In both sentences, the speaker expresses that an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank would be welcome, and mentions that the Bank's meeting is scheduled for Thursday. Here's a breakdown of the key similarities and differences between the two sentences: 1. Sentence 1: \\"He had also said an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank, which meets Thursday, would be welcome.\\" In this sentence, the speaker shares their comment about the interest rate cut without specifying the context or timeline in which they said it. 2. Sentence 2: \\"He had also said on the eve of Monday's talks that an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank, which meets on Thursday, would be welcome.\\" In this sentence, the additional information regarding the context in which the statement was made can be found. It reveals that the speaker shared their comment on the eve of Monday's talks. This gives a clearer timeline of when the statement was made in comparison to the first sentence. To sum up, although both sentences are expressing the same core idea – that an interest rate cut by the European Central Bank would be welcome and the ECB meeting is on Thursday – the second sentence provides more detailed information about the context in which the statement was made.

Answer the following question: Here's a question: Where on the east coast of the U.S. would you find some of the most famous skyscrapers? Here are possible answers to this question: - big city - chicago - large city - in the sky - new york city I believe the correct choice is \\"new york city\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"New York City is indeed the correct choice for finding some of the most famous skyscrapers on the east coast of the United States, and there are several reasons why this is the case. Firstly, New York City has been a global financial and cultural center for many years, providing the necessary resources and motivation for the construction of iconic skyscrapers that reach far into the sky. The city is home to Wall Street, which has had a profound impact on global financial markets since the 1790s when the New York Stock Exchange was established. This concentration of wealth and international influence created a competitive environment for businesses and architects alike, leading to the design, construction, and financing of impressive office buildings. Secondly, the unique geography and limited land available on the island of Manhattan has contributed to the vertical expansion of the city's skyline. As space was limited and the demand for prime real estate grew, the buildings grew taller, resulting in an impressive skyline that stands out not only in the United States but worldwide. Manhattan is surrounded by water and has limited space for construction, so building upwards became a necessity, setting a trend for ever-taller buildings that other parts of the country and world would later follow. Thirdly, some of the most famous and iconic skyscrapers in the world are found in New York City. The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, held the title of the world's tallest building for almost 40 years and is still an emblematic symbol of the city's skyline. The iconic Flatiron Building, built in 1902, is known for its unique triangular shape and was considered a groundbreaking architectural marvel in its time. The One World Trade Center, completed in 2013, is now the tallest building in the United States and stands as a tribute to the city's resilience following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. In addition to these well-known examples, New York City is also home to numerous other skyscrapers showcasing a wide range of architectural styles that have evolved over the past hundred years. Examples include the Art Deco Chrysler Building, the modernist Seagram Building, and the recently completed Hudson Yards complex featuring modern designs such as the sleek, angular 30 Hudson Yards. In conclusion, New York City is the correct choice when considering where to find some of the most famous skyscrapers on the east coast of the U.S. Due to its role as a global financial and cultural center, its unique geography, and its impressive collection of iconic and historically significant buildings, New York City's skyline is unmatched in the United States and serves as a symbol of architectural innovation and achievement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? What can I use to bind two pallets together?","completion":"To bind two pallets together, you can follow these steps: Step 1: Assess the Pallets Examine the pallets to ensure they are in good condition, and have a similar size and structure to ensure proper alignment and stability when joined together. Step 2: Choose a Binding Method There are several methods to choose from to bind the pallets together, including straps, rope, wood glue, metal brackets, and screws or nails. You can select a method based on the materials you have available, the sturdiness required, and your level of expertise in handling each material. Step 3: Prepare the Pallets Clean the pallets and remove any debris before starting the binding process. If needed, you can also sand the edges of the pallets to make them smoother and safer to work with. Step 4: Position and Align the Pallets Place the two pallets on a flat surface, close together, and carefully align them to ensure the desired structure is achieved. It's crucial to get the positioning right for stability and appearance. Step 5: Bind the Pallets Now, perform the chosen binding method: - Straps or rope: Wrap straps or rope securely around the pallets to hold them together tightly. Knot or fasten the ends securely. - Wood glue: Apply a generous amount of wood glue to one side of one pallet and press it tightly against the other. Clamp them together and let the glue dry for the recommended time. - Metal brackets: Fasten metal brackets to the corners of the pallets using screws. This method provides extra stability and sturdiness. - Screws or nails: Drill pilot holes at the desired locations and then insert screws or nails to join the pallets together. Step 6: Reinforce if Necessary Assess the stability of the joined pallets once the binding is complete. If additional reinforcement is needed, you can use a combination of binding methods or add more fasteners, straps, or brackets. Step 7: Finish the Project After the binding is complete and you are satisfied with the stability of the joined pallets, you can apply a coat of paint or sealer if you wish to enhance the appearance and protection of your project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: In Colorado, everyone makes sure they get vaccinated for measles. However in Ontario they don't like to get vaccines so most of the population skips them. One year a major measles outbreak occurs. But I can use this background: You don’t have to suffer through an infection to gain immunity to some diseases. Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease. Diseases you are likely to have been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. What is an answer for this question: Given the people of Ontario are now required to get vaccinated for measles, will the infection rate in Ontario increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"Given that the people of Ontario are now required to get vaccinated for measles, the infection rate in Ontario will likely decrease. Vaccination is a proven method of reducing the spread of diseases by creating immunity in the population. When a high percentage of the population is vaccinated, it creates herd immunity, which makes it difficult for the disease to spread. This is because there are fewer people susceptible to infection, decreasing the chances of an outbreak. Thus, with the implementation of a vaccination requirement for measles in Ontario, the infection rate should decrease significantly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: It's All In the Game As the non-Mitt Romney portion of the Republican nomination contest grows ever more bizarre and baroque, Jay Cost speaks the cold, hard truth: Many conservatives are frustrated by the prospect of a Romney nomination, but the reality is that Romney is the only remaining GOP candidate who has shown any facility with what Frank Kent once called “The Great Game of Politics.” Now, don’t get me wrong. I am as frustrated as the next guy with the way the game of modern politics is played. If you are hosting a debate about the way the current system is set up, invite me to participate and I will be a vigorous and unflappable advocate for reform. In particular, I think our absurdly long, vicious, and costly primary campaign dissuades the best of the lot, and that conservatives would be better served by a nomination process similar to the old conventions. But here’s the problem that conservatives must confront, squarely and honestly: nominating a candidate who either refuses to play the game, or plays it poorly, is no way to win. The game is what it is. Last week my colleague Nate Silver wrote a post chiding pundits for taking a “no way, no how, no chance” attitude toward Herman Cain’s presidential candidacy. There has probably never “been a candidate with such strong polling but such weak fundamentals,” he pointed out, “at least not at this relatively advanced stage of the race,” and Cain’s outlier status should give commentators pause: It implies “that there is either something fundamentally unusual about this year’s Republican nomination process, or perhaps that some sort of ‘new normal’ has been established and that the old rules of how you win a nomination no longer carry as much weight.” It’s a reasonable point, but I think Cost’s description of the nominating process as a “game” suggests a possible rejoinder to Silver’s argument. I’ve been writing about baseball recently, so imagine the Republican primary season as a baseball season, and Herman Cain as a team that nobody expected to contend — the 2011 Pittsburgh Pirates, let’s say. Then recall that in July of this season, the Pirates were temporarily in first place in the National League Central, ahead of both the eventual division-winning Brewers and the eventual World Series champion Cardinals, even though they still had the fundamentals of a lousy team. (When their actual record stood at 53-47, one statistical analysis suggested that they were actually performing more like a 44-56 club.) At that point, one could have argued that the normal rules of baseball had somehow been suspended, and the Pirates had found a new way to win. (I’m sure a lot of Pittsburghers wanted to believe it!) But the more plausible alternative was to trust the fundamentals over the team’s (real enough, but ultimately misleading) record, and assume that the Pirates would ultimately fall back — as, sure enough, they did, finishing at 72-90 for the season. Now of course a team’s luck can theoretically hold even longer than the Pirates’ did, and maybe the same could be true of Herman Cain (his current troubles notwithstanding). But a primary campaign really is a lot like a baseball season: When it’s a competition rather than a coronation, it’s long enough and grueling enough that form and fundamentals win out over hot streaks and good fortune. A candidate like Cain can win individual primaries, in much the same way that a team like the 2011 Pirates could rip off impressive winning streaks. But we’d need to be much, much deeper into the actual voting — past Super Tuesday, at the very least — before I’d consider trusting any polling surge over the fundamentals of the game.","completion":"The article discusses the Republican nomination contest and the frustration many conservatives feel about the prospect of Romney's nomination. It argues that while the primary campaign might be long, vicious, and costly, it ultimately leads to a candidate who can play the game of politics well.

The author emphasizes the importance of trusting fundamentals and form over hot streaks and good fortune in political campaigns, much like in a baseball season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The last step in this process involves the continuous cycling, interaction, and balance of these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which plays a significant role in regulating Earth's temperature and maintaining the planet's overall climate equilibrium. In detail, the complete process can be described as follows: 1. Various sources contribute to the formation of different types of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These sources can be both natural (such as volcanic eruptions, decay of organic matter, and respiration of plants and animals) and anthropogenic (such as burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes). 2. Once emitted, these gases mix with other components in the atmosphere and disperse over varying distances depending on their atmospheric lifetime and transport mechanisms. 3. When solar radiation from the sun reaches Earth, some of it is absorbed by the Earth's surface, warming the planet. This energy is then released by the Earth as longwave or infrared radiation. 4. Greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere absorb and re-emit some of this longwave radiation, trapping the heat and causing the greenhouse effect. This process helps maintain the Earth's temperature within a range that supports life. 5. To maintain a balance between incoming and outgoing radiation, the Earth's climate system constantly adjusts. Various feedback mechanisms are involved in this process, such as the release of more water vapor (also a greenhouse gas) when the atmosphere warms, and the increase in cloud cover, which can either amplify or dampen warming depending on their properties and altitude. 6. In the last step, the Earth's climate system continuously cycles and reprocesses these greenhouse gases through various natural processes like the carbon cycle, where carbon is exchanged between the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial ecosystems. In addition to natural climate variability, anthropogenic activities can disrupt this balance by altering the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to climate change. To address this issue, international efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adopting cleaner sources of energy, and increasing energy efficiency are crucial in ensuring the Earth's atmospheric balance is maintained and long-term global warming is minimized."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Four aliens discover it and are sucked into the craft through its vacuum tube, after which it makes its way back to Earth. The aliens are able to escape from a government base by using their powers (with which they can destroy or heal anything they touch). During the escape, the youngest one hides in a passing van, occupied by a boy named Eric Cruise who uses a wheelchair, his older brother, Michael, and their single mother, Janet, who are moving to California from Illinois. Shortly after the Cruise family arrives at their new home, Eric becomes suspicious of the alien's presence. The next morning, he finds that the creature has trashed most of the house and learns its identity, but is blamed alongside his brother by their mother for what has happened. After seeing the creature again, Eric tries to catch up to him, but ends up sliding down a hill and falls into a lake, where he nearly drowns, but is rescued by the alien. Eric is not believed at all when he tries to tell his family about the creature's actions. Later that night, he sets a trap with the help of his new friend, Debbie, who had also seen the alien.

How is \\"Perhaps Mr Mandelson could tell us what that justification is because, from an institutional perspective, we cannot pretend that, after two out of the last three ministerials ended in collapse, we are dealing with business as usual.\\" said in German?","completion":"\\"Vielleicht könnte uns Herr Mandelson die Rechtfertigung dafür nennen, denn aus institutioneller Sicht können wir nicht so tun, als ob wir nach dem Zusammenbruch von zwei der letzten drei Ministertreffen wie gewohnt weitermachen.\\" Here's a detailed context-based translation breakdown: 1. \\"Perhaps Mr Mandelson could tell us what that justification is\\" translates to \\"Vielleicht könnte uns Herr Mandelson die Rechtfertigung dafür nennen\\". In German, the verb typically goes to the end of a sentence when there is a modal verb (could, would, should). The word ‘dafür’ here is used to reference ‘justification’ which is expected to be explained by Mr. Mandelson. 2. \\"because\\" translates to \\"denn\\" in this context, connecting two draft sentences in German. ‘Denn’ introduces a main clause (Hauptsatz) that provides the reason or explanation for what was stated in the preceding main clause. 3. \\"from an institutional perspective\\" translates to \\"aus institutioneller Sicht\\". Prepositions can be tricky in German, but here \\"aus\\" is used because we're looking \\"from/out of\\" a specific perspective. 4. \\"we cannot pretend\\" translates to \\"wir können nicht so tun\\". Again, with modal verbs in German the main verb is pushed to the last position in the clause. 5. \\"that\\" has been translated as \\"als ob\\". This conjunction is used to express a hypothetical situation. 6. \\"after two out of the last three ministerials ended in collapse\\" translates to \\"nach dem Zusammenbruch von zwei der letzten drei Ministertreffen\\". The key difference here is that the structure of expressing a quantity (two out of the last three) is somewhat flipped in German. 7. \\"we are dealing with business as usual\\" translates to \\"wir machen wie gewohnt weiter\\". It’s again the verb at the end and \\"weitermachen\\" expresses the idea of continuing as usual. Importantly, while this translation attempts to maintain as closely as possible the sense and structure of the original English sentence, it is worth noting that some choices reflect a more \\"translator-like\\" German: a native speaker might opt for different choices, particularly in terms of sentence structure or word order, to make the phrase feel more natural."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The region's major cities include Cesena, Faenza, Forlì, Imola, Ravenna, Rimini and City of San Marino (San Marino is a landlocked state inside the Romagna historical region).

It later took on the more detailed meaning of \\"territory subjected to Eastern Roman rule\\", whose citizens called themselves Romans (\\"Romani\\" in Latin; \\"Romàioi\\" in Greek). Thus the term \\"Romània\\" came to be used to refer to the territory administered by the Exarchate of Ravenna in contrast to other parts of Northern Italy under Lombard rule, named \\"Langobardia\\" or \\"Lombardy\\". \\"Romània\\" later became \\"Romandìola\\" in Vulgar Latin, meaning \\"little Romània\\", which became \\"Romagna\\" in modern times.

These luxurious woods are both visually appealing and offer many benefits to homeowners, from being more environmentally friendly to providing unparalleled durability. In this article, we'll explore some of the most popular exotic woods used in upscale home designs, discussing their features, benefits, and the possible applications to enhance the beauty and value of your home. 1. Teak Teak, a tropical hardwood native to Southeast Asia, has long been valued for its beauty, durability, and water resistance. Often used for outdoor furniture or boat decks, teak has a rich golden-brown hue that, over time, develops a stunning silver patina. This wood's exceptional strength and natural resistance to decay make it perfect for high-end homes in damp or humid climates, particularly for areas like kitchens, bathrooms, and outdoor spaces. Moreover, teak's tight grain pattern and uniform texture make it a popular choice for flooring, giving your home an upscale, elegant touch. 2. Ebony Known for its extraordinary deep black color, ebony is a hardwood prized for its strength, durability, and visual appeal. This dense wood is native to India, Africa, and Indonesia and is best used indoors due to its sensitivity to moisture and sunlight exposure. Ebony is ideal for creating striking contrasts in your home décor, such as inlays in wooden furniture or accents in paneling. Its fine-grained texture allows for intricate carving and elaborate detailing, making it perfect for high-end homes with a penchant for attention to detail. 3. Mahogany Another tropical hardwood to consider for your high-end home is mahogany, renowned for its reddish-brown color, stability, and workability. Mahogany is native to Central and South America and the West Indies, and it has been a favorite of furniture makers for centuries due to its classic beauty and even texture. Mahogany is a great option for interior woodwork, such as wainscoting, trim, and cabinetry. It is also a popular choice for shutters, doors, and window frames, as it has natural resistance to rot and insects. 4. Wenge Originating from Africa, wenge is an exotic hardwood with a dark chocolate brown color and striking black grain patterns. Wenge's unique appearance makes it an ideal choice for luxury flooring, cabinetry, and custom furniture. This heavy and dense wood is highly durable, making it an excellent choice for high-traffic areas in your upscale home. Although wenge may be more challenging to work with due to its hardness, the results are well worth the effort - a sophisticated, exotic touch that will set your home apart. 5. Purpleheart True to its name, purpleheart boasts a stunning deep purple hue that, when exposed to sunlight, darkens to a lovely rich brown with purple undertones. This eye-catching wood, native to Central and South America, is incredibly dense and durable, making it an excellent option for cabinetry, countertops, and flooring. With its natural resistance to insects and decay, purpleheart is also a great choice for outdoor applications like decks and pergolas. Incorporating this exotic wood into your high-end home will undoubtedly make a bold, memorable statement. 6. Bamboo Although technically a grass, bamboo is often categorized as a hardwood due to its impressive durability and strength. Bamboo is an eco-friendly and rapidly renewable resource, making it an appealing choice for green-minded homeowners. It offers a unique, contemporary aesthetic with its pale beige to honey color and natural striations. Bamboo is ideal for flooring, cabinetry, and paneling, providing a clean, modern look in high-end homes. Conclusion Incorporating exotic woods into your high-end home's design is an excellent way to add unparalleled elegance, beauty, and sophistication. From teak's water resistance and rich patina to ebony's striking contrast and detailed carving possibilities, there is an exotic wood to suit any homeowner's taste and desired aesthetic. By investing in these luxurious and durable materials, your home will not only exude style but also stand the test of time, becoming a cherished sanctuary for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Barnes & Noble’s Nook Sold Out for the Holidays Update | 1:56 p.m. Added comment from a Forrester analyst on the e-reader shortage. Update | 3:00 p.m. Added comment from Amazon.com. It’s shaping up to a be very merry holiday season for Amazon.com’s Kindle e-reader. Earlier this week, we reported that Sony could not guarantee that its new Daily Edition Reader would reach online buyers in time for Christmas. Now Barnes & Noble says that preorders of its stylish new Nook e-reader have exceeded expectations, and that the company has sold out of its initial supply of devices. Amazon had these same problems last year but now appears to have gotten its manufacturing and supply chain in order. That leaves the Kindle as the most prominent wireless e-reader available for the holidays, although Sony is still selling two non-wireless Readers, The Pocket and the Touch, which must be plugged into PCs to download books. Barnes & Noble says customers ordering a Nook will receive their devices the week of Jan. 4. So that stockings are not left completely empty, the bookseller will furnish buyers with a special holiday certificate — presumably with real ink on actual paper. Update: In an e-mail message, Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, illuminated the causes of some of the supply problems. She said Sony and Barnes & Noble rushed their product announcements, and neither was truly ready to begin selling their devices this year. “Even without specific problems in the supply chain, the manufacturing process takes time for new products — it could be 3 months from the time they place the orders with their factories until they actually ship,” she wrote. “Sony and B&N wanted to show the market they could compete with Amazon for the holiday season. Consumers responded enthusiastically, but unfortunately, these companies are struggling to deliver on their promise. Now they have to face disappointed consumers with empty packages under the tree.” Update 2: An Amazon spokesman, Drew Herdener, e-mailed this comment in a response to a question about Kindle availability. Referring to the Nook, he wrote, “Kindle is 40 percent thinner, 10 percent lighter, with 2 times the battery life. It’s the best-selling, the most wished-for, and the most gifted product on Amazon across all product categories — not just electronics. Kindle manufacturing is humming, and the latest generation Kindle — just released in October — is in stock and available for immediate shipment today.”","completion":"Amazon's Kindle e-reader is doing really well for the holiday season. Barnes & Noble's Nook e-reader is sold out because they didn't make enough in time. Sony also couldn't make enough of their new Daily Edition Reader for Christmas. That means Amazon's Kindle is the most popular wireless e-reader people can get for the holidays. People who order a Nook will have to wait until January to get it, but they will get a nice certificate for the holidays."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Campaigners have vowed to continue fighting to keep Manston open. In a statement, the airport spokesman said it had also considered business proposals put forward by staff but those would have still required losses to be subsidised. \\"In the absence of other options, the decision has been taken to close the airport on 15 May,\\" it said. \\"Individual consultation will now take place with all staff members who will be supported through this process.\\" Staff were told of the decision to close the airport at a meeting on Tuesday morning. The site was bought by Ann Gloag, who co-founded the Stagecoach Group, for Â£1 last year. In March, the airport said it was in talks about closing because it was losing Â£10,000 a day. Several airlines have pulled out, including KLM, which ran two daily flights to Amsterdam. In a joint statement, local Conservative MPs Sir Roger Gale and Laura Sandys, said there was \\"ongoing and serious interest\\" in the acquisition of Manston as a working airport and they hoped the current owners could be persuaded to reconsider. \\"We are convinced that, given more time, real progress could have been made and it is thus hugely disappointing that the decision has been taken to close it.\\" US firm RiverOak Investment, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut, said it had made an offer to acquire 100% of the shares in the company that owned Manston Airport. It said it had 350m (Â£206m) in assets and a successful track record of turning around \\"troubled operating and real estate assets\\". The company said it had developed a long-term plan to own and manage Manston as an airport. In a statement, it said: \\"RiverOak is distressed to learn of the announced closure of Manston today and remains willing to engage with all parties to achieve a solution which allows the airport to continue operating and preserves the jobs of its staff.\\" Wendy Fraser, group secretary of Save Manston Airport, said campaigners would be stepping up their campaign to keep the airport open \\"We'll fight to reopen it if it does close, and we will not let this be made into anything but an airport,\\" she said.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Canadian English (CanE, CE, en-CA) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Canada. According to the 2011 census, English was the first language of approximately 19 million Canadians, or 57% of the population; the remainder of the population were native speakers of Canadian French (22%) or other languages (allophones, 21%). A larger number, 28 million people, reported using English as their dominant language. 82% of Canadians outside the province of Quebec reported speaking English natively, but within Quebec the figure was just 7.7% as most of its residents are native speakers of Quebec French. - Australian English (AuE, en-AU) is a major variety of the English language, used throughout Australia. Although English has no official status in the Constitution, Australian English is the country's \\"de facto\\" official language and is the first language of the majority of the population. - South African English (SAfrE, SAfrEng, SAE, en-ZA) is the set of English dialects spoken by South Africans. There is considerable social and regional variation within South African English. Three variants (termed \\"The Great Trichotomy\\" by Roger Lass) are commonly identified within White South African English (as in Australian English), spoken primarily by White South Africans: \\"Cultivated\\", closely approximating England's standard Received Pronunciation and associated with the upper class; \\"General\\", a social indicator of the middle class; and \\"Broad\\", associated with the working class, and closely approximating the second-language Afrikaner variety called Afrikaans English. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious \\"acrolect\\" and a more middle-ranging, mainstream \\"mesolect\\". Other varieties of South African English include Cape Flats English, originally associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers, and the Indian South African English of Indian South Africans. Further offshoots include the first-language English varieties spoken by Zimbabweans, Zambians, Swazilanders and Namibians. - Thomas J. O'Connell ( 21 November 1882 -- 22 June 1969 ) was an Irish trade unionist and politician , and was leader of the Irish Labour Party from 1927 to 1932 . O'Connell was born near Knock , County Mayo . From 1902 to 1916 he worked first as a national teacher and then as a school principal . In 1926 he became general secretary of the Irish National Teachers ' Organisation . He was a member of Dáil Éireann from 1922 to 1932 , serving as leader of the Irish Labour Party in the Dáil from 1927 to 1932 . From 1929 to 1930 he was president of the Irish Labour Party and the Irish Trade Union Congress . In 1935 he founded the Educational Building Society . - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\" - A trade union (British EnglishAustralian EnglishNew Zealand EnglishSouth African English / Caribbean English; also trades union), labour union (Canadian English), or labor union (American English) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members (rank and file members) and negotiates labour contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is \\"maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment\\". This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies. - New Zealand English (NZE) is the dialect of the English language spoken by most English-speaking New Zealanders. Its language code in ISO and Internet standards is en-NZ. English is one of New Zealand's three official languages (along with New Zealand Sign Language and \\"te reo Mori\\") and is the first language of the majority of the population. - Caribbean English is a broad term for the dialects of the English language spoken in the Caribbean and Liberia, most countries on the Caribbean coast of Central America, and Guyana. Caribbean English is influenced by the English-based Creole varieties spoken in the region, but they are not the same. In the Caribbean, there is a great deal of variation in the way English is spoken. Scholars generally agree that although the dialects themselves vary significantly in each of these countries, they all have roots in 17th-century English and African languages.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 'Home Land': Admit It: Your Life Stinks EW activities are as likely to bring on a fit of depressive jealousy as leafing through the back pages of one's alumni magazine. While you molder in a studio apartment, stuck in a dead-end job, your former classmates are founding clinics in Thailand, cranking out best sellers and unveiling major new paintings -- as well as bearing exceptional children. You thought you'd be a success, or at least have a chance to make a decent stab at it while you were still young. Sorry. Lewis Miner, the antihero of Sam Lipsyte's bracingly bleak new novel, has more reason to despair than most. Since graduating from New Jersey's Eastern Valley High School (class of '89), he's spent his years trolling the Internet for compromising photos of girls in leg warmers, drafting fake histories of soda for an in-house newsletter called Fizz and hanging out with Gary, his stoner high-school friend. Happy to admit that in comparison with classmates so well rounded they are practically ''spherical,'' he ''did not pan out,'' Miner is nonetheless convinced that the majority of the dispatches in Catamount Notes, his alma mater's newsletter, are ''cheery falsehoods . . . the high-fives and pompom struts of communal denial.'' Written as a series of unembroidered letters Miner sends to Catamount Notes, ''Home Land'' is an energetic campaign against the art of the sunny update. This novel, which follows Lipsyte's collection of short stories, ''Venus Drive,'' and a novel, ''The Subject Steve,'' has an obvious forebear in Philip Roth's ''Portnoy's Complaint.'' Like Portnoy, Miner piles clausal filigree upon clausal filigree to create a baroque edifice of seething irony. Like Portnoy, too, Miner has been wrecked upon the shoals of love (self- and otherwise). His logorrheic communiques must constitute the longest -- to say nothing of the most honest -- alumni note ever. Miner's missives -- which, needless to say, remain unpublished -- give ample proof that life has taught him ''to cherish, in short, the short straw.'' As the novel begins, we learn that his girlfriend, Gwendolyn, has just left him to minister to her needy movie-star brother, Lenny. His mother, who divorced early and became a refugee from 1970's feminism, has recently died from metastatic cancer. (The word metastatic ''sounded like a funk band,'' Miner intones.) And though high school is long ago, he is still known by the nickname Teabag, spawned from an unfortunate encounter with some members of the football team in Eastern Valley's shower room. But ''Home Land'' is not simply an account of life at the bottom of the food chain. Miner is too interesting a loser -- in the face of his vast inconsequence, he remains unbowed. ''I cannot, will not, hold my horses,'' he writes. ''My horses are gorgeous things, sweat-carved, sun-snorting beasts. Look at them go! See them gallop at some equine destiny I am ill equipped to comprehend.'' Warned by a former locker-room bully to stay out of the mall, Miner observes: ''It was a silly thing for him to say, Valley Cats. No man can tell another man to stay out of the mall. . . . That's not what the framers intended.'' He knows humiliation is not the source of his agony -- loneliness is. Even the shower-room incident didn't faze him for the conventional reasons. ''I'd been under the impression it was some kind of a hazing ritual,'' he writes. ''What hurt was afterward, when I still didn't belong.'' Miner is bent on making his peers answer yes to the rhetorical question, ''Don't we all settle, Valley Cats?'' The great mystery is why Miner himself has. It's partly a corporeal problem -- he has never understood how ''to 'make something of myself' . . . as it implies I am both the raw material and the artisan manipulating it.'' But, as Lipsyte pointedly shows, Miner is less a loser than an avatar of failure, a high priest of defects. What he truly wants is to enlighten those of us who have yet to acknowledge our own flaws -- in other words, almost everybody. Lizzie Skurnick is the editor of Old Hag, a literary blog.

Question: suppose the liver is not functioning happens, how will it affect LESS regulation of blood sugar level being needed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: less If the liver is not functioning properly, it will be unable to convert glucagon into glucose and release it into the bloodstream as efficiently as it should. This will have an impact on the regulation of blood sugar levels. In this case, there will be less regulation of blood sugar levels needed because the liver's inability to respond to glucagon will cause blood sugar levels to remain relatively low, as there will be less glucose being released to raise blood sugar levels. However, it is important to note that this situation is not ideal, as the body needs proper regulation of blood sugar levels to function optimally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bit devastated that I lost my entire documents folder on my home computer. Possible answers: (1). negative; (2). positive;","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"Bit devastated that I lost my entire documents folder on my home computer\\" can be described as (1). Negative. The reason for categorizing this sentiment as negative is based on the presence of multiple indicators that portray a sense of unhappiness, frustration, or inconvenience. The word \\"devastated\\" implies a strong emotional reaction to the loss of the author's documents folder, suggesting feelings of disappointment and distress. The phrase \\"lost my entire documents folder\\" conveys that the individual experienced an unintended and unwanted outcome, leading to further negative emotions. Negative sentiments are generally characterized by the expression of disappointment, anger, sadness, or other adverse emotional states. In contrast, positive sentiments involve expressions of happiness, excitement, gratitude, or satisfaction. This tweet clearly demonstrates the author's upset over losing important information, which aligns with the characteristics of a negative sentiment. In summary, the sentiment of the given tweet should be classified as negative due to the presence of strong emotions such as devastation and the loss of valuable data. The tweet does not display any positive sentiment, making the choice of (1). Negative, the most fitting option."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Hi there, little buddy! Let's understand your questions step by step: 1. The percentage of the Indian population in the U.S. is about how many people who are from India live in the United States compared to all the people living there. Imagine there are 100 people, and 2 of them are from India. That means 2% of the people are Indian. 2. The percentage of Indian population that are introverts is about how many people in India like to spend more time alone or in quiet places than being in big noisy groups. Again, if 100 people are from India and 40 of them like to be alone, that means 40% of the Indian population are introverts. 3. Now to answer if these questions are the same. They are different! The first question is about where Indian people live (in the U.S.). The second question is about how Indian people feel (whether they are introverted or not).

The headstrong, free-spirited night club singer from New York did not mix well with the New Port society; equally ill at ease are Buddy and Harris. Buddy is an idealist young man who drown his frustration with himself and his family stature into bottles of champagne; while Harris has to deal with the constant reminder that he should know \\"his place\\" when socialising with the masters, even though he is now a respected doctor.While Ann and Harris left the party to spend a night together, Buddy was killed in a car accident when chasing after them. Overwhelmed with guilt, and knowing that Lila is still in love with Harris, the lovers parted ways even though they remained in love with each other.Running parallel to the flashback, another plot line shows Ann's two daughters struggling with old feuds and the pressure of looking after the dying woman.

A family operation that knows what barbecue is all about. I've eaten here on a number of occasions and have yet to have a bad meal. The elder statesman will be outside conducting tours of the smoker and handing out bottles of water to patrons standing in line. The young pitmaster is inside carving and serving up some of the best Texas barbecue to be had outside of Austin or Longview; not to mention this is the friendliest service I've seen in a long time. The Upside: The food is phenomenal. Absolutely the best Texas-style barbecue in Phoenix bar none. You need to get here early because Scott only smokes so much and he usually sells out by 1:30pm. But, the beef ribs, when offered, are usually gone by 12;30... For pork ribs, the meat just falls off the bone. For beef ribs, the cracked pepper rub is the best. The brisket has a nice bark and a smoke flavor that's just outstanding, Having eaten here on several occasions, none of the meats have been dry or anything other than top notch. The sauces are all made in-house. The sides are also excellent. My favorites are the cole slaw and the barbecue beans. They've recently started offering a pecan pie baked off in the smoker. I can't wait to try this new item. Sorry, guys, I'm not a fan of cheese grits -- no matter what!! (LOL!!) Drinks? Canned and bottled Coke products are offered. The Downside: They open at 11:00am. If you arrive after 11:30, you'll spend more time waiting on line than you will ordering/eating. Recently, I arrived just before noon and didn't get done eating until almost 2:00pm. The line outside the door, a testament to the quality of the food, is also the real enemy of this place. If you're handicapped, you're S.O.L. Plan accordingly. I would have given Little Miss BBQ five stars, but have to knock them down half a star because if you're handicapped or simply can't stand in line for almost an hour it's practically impossible to eat here. There are no phone orders (I tried.) -- unless you order more than five lbs of meat and place your order 48 hrs in advance.

I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke. As for the actors, I didn't like them either. Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's horrid. John Stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichéd it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever. The middle girl Stephanie was too clichéd as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it's cringe worthy. This is a \\"family\\" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much.

Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160 Ma, followed by the Indian subcontinent in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a marsupial fauna. In the Eocene epoch, about 40 Ma Australia-New Guinea separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear.

Article: To celebrate the end of our exams, my friends and I went to a fast food restaurant. We ordered hamburgers and Coca Cola at the counter. When our food came, I started walking towards an empty table. By bad luck, my purse strap got caught on a chair and the tray that I was holding slipped from my hands and went flying in the air. The tray, and its contents, fell on a man who was just about to take a bite of his sandwich. I stared, greatly shocked , as the drinks soaked his white shirt. Then I closed my eyes and prepared myself for his burst of anger. Instead, he said \\"It's OK\\" to comfort me before he disappeared into the washroom. Still shaky and unsure what to do next, my friends and I went to a table and sat there, trying our best to look calm. A moment later, the man came out of the washroom and approached our table. My heart almost stopped beating. I thought he was going to ask for my father' s number and call him. To my surprise, he merely smiled at us, handed us some cash and said, \\"Buy yourself new hamburgers.\\" He then walked away without even finishing his food. He could have made what was already an uncomfortable situation worse, but he chose a different way and gave us a reason to believe that there is still kindness in this world. I'll never forget his actions. Question: What do we know about the man? Options: A: He was very rich. B: He was kind and forgiving. C: He made the situation worse. D: He enjoyed his food in the restaurant. The answer is:","completion":"B: He was kind and forgiving. From the information provided in the article, we can deduce that the man was kind and forgiving because when the tray and its contents fell on him, he did not get angry or react negatively. Instead, he comforted the girl, assuring her that it was okay. We can further confirm his kind and forgiving nature when he returned to the table of friends after cleaning up, handing them cash to buy new hamburgers instead of demanding any sort of compensation or apology. He did not make the situation worse nor did he allow it to negatively impact his interaction with the girl who accidentally spilled food on him. His actions demonstrated genuine kindness and forgiveness, as well as an understanding that mistakes can happen. Although we cannot definitively say that he was very rich or that he enjoyed his food in the restaurant, based on the options provided, the best and most accurate answer to describe what we know about the man is that he was kind and forgiving."},{"prompt":"Information: - A grape is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus \\"Vitis\\". - Pseudoperonospora is a genus of water moulds which includes several species known for causing downy mildew infections on plants .

The term \\"vegetable\\" is somewhat arbitrary, and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition. It normally excludes other food derived from plants such as fruits, nuts, and cereal grains, but includes seeds such as pulses. The original meaning of the word \\"vegetable\\", still used in biology, was to describe all types of plant, as in the terms \\"vegetable kingdom\\" and \\"vegetable matter\\". - Downy mildew refers to any of several types of oomycete microbes that are obligate parasites of plants. Downy mildews exclusively belong to Peronosporaceae. In commercial agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of crucifers, grapes and vegetables that grow on vines. The prime example is \\"Peronospora farinosa\\" featured in NCBI-Taxonomy and HYP3. This pathogen does not produce survival structures in the northern states of the United States, and overwinters as live mildew colonies in Gulf Coast states. It progresses northward with cucurbit production each spring. Yield loss associated with downy mildew is most likely related to soft rots that occur after plant canopies collapse and sunburn occurs on fruit. Cucurbit downy mildew only affects leaves of cucurbit plants. - Peronosporaceae are a family of water moulds that contains 17 genera, comprising more than 600 species. Most of them are called downy mildews.

They are filamentous, microscopic, absorptive organisms that reproduce both sexually and asexually. Oomycetes occupy both saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles, and include some of the most notorious pathogens of plants, causing devastating diseases such as late blight of potato and sudden oak death. One oomycete, the mycoparasite \\"Pythium oligandrum\\", is used for biocontrol, attacking plant pathogenic fungi. The oomycetes are also often referred to as water molds (or water moulds), although the water-preferring nature which led to that name is not true of most species, which are terrestrial pathogens.

In architecture Durer cites Vitruvius but elaborates his own classical designs and columns. In typography, Durer depicts the geometric construction of the Latin alphabet, relying on Italian precedent. However, his construction of the Gothic alphabet is based upon an entirely different modular system. The fourth book completes the progression of the first and second by moving to three-dimensional forms and the construction of polyhedra. Here Durer discusses the five Platonic solids, as well as seven Archimedean semi-regular solids, as well as several of his own invention. In all these, Durer shows the objects as nets. Finally, Durer discusses the Delian Problem and moves on to the 'construzione legittima', a method of depicting a cube in two dimensions through linear perspective. It was in Bologna that Durer was taught (possibly by Luca Pacioli or Bramante) the principles of linear perspective, and evidently became familiar with the 'costruzione legittima' in a written description of these principles found only, at this time, in the unpublished treatise of Piero della Francesca. He was also familiar with the 'abbreviated construction' as described by Alberti and the geometrical construction of shadows, a technique of Leonardo da Vinci. Although Durer made no innovations in these areas, he is notable as the first Northern European to treat matters of visual representation in a scientific way, and with understanding of Euclidean principles. In addition to these geometrical constructions, Durer discusses in this last book of Underweysung der Messung an assortment of mechanisms for drawing in perspective from models and provides woodcut illustrations of these methods that are often reproduced in discussions of perspective.

Matter refers to everything that occupies space and has mass. It can exist in several states, such as solid, liquid, and gas, and can change from one state to another through different physical processes like melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation. The properties and behavior of matter are studied in many branches of science including physics, chemistry, geology, and astronomy. On the other hand, energy is the capacity to do work or the ability to cause change. It can be converted from one form to another but can neither be created nor destroyed, according to the law of conservation of energy. There are different forms of energy such as kinetic, potential, thermal, electric, magnetic, chemical, and nuclear energy. The study of the transformation, transmission, and effects of energy is central to physics and many other scientific disciplines. Together, matter and energy constitute the basic components that make up the universe. They are intertwined in many ways, exemplified by Albert Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2, which demonstrates that matter and energy are interchangeable.

News article: What it takes to get goalposts ready for their job Last year in the NFL, 35 different kickers made a total of 1,262 extra points and 863 field goals over the course of the regular season, and chances are good that not once did any of them — or any of us watching — think twice about the goalposts those kicks sailed through. For David Moxley, however, goalposts are pretty much always on the brain. As the director of sports construction sales for Sportsfield Specialties, Moxley’s job, in part, is to make sure the goalposts his company manufactures are doing exactly what they’re designed to do: stand up straight, hold up to the elements and only get in the way when they’re supposed to. From high school to college to the pros, goalposts are largely taken for granted — overlooked like other critical field components such as hash-marks and pylons — but the process by which the posts are made is quite sophisticated. At Sportsfield Specialties, about 40 employees on the metal production team in Delhi, N.Y., create 400 to 450 sets of goalposts per year, with each goalpost requiring 15 to 18 hours of labor before it’s field-ready, once all the engineering, cutting, rolling, milling, welding and painting is finished. (The company also has a facility in Salisbury, N.C., where “soft goods,” such as goalpost padding, are made.) With goalposts in 23 of the 31 NFL stadiums and countless college stadiums, Moxley and his colleagues know that precision is key and that there’s no margin for error — it would be front-page news for all the wrong reasons if a goalpost failed during a game, for example — but the operation leaves plenty of room for imperfection if instruments aren’t programmed and calibrated correctly and employees aren’t totally focused on the task at hand. A standard goalpost is made up of four basic components: a base, called the “gooseneck,” a crossbar and two uprights. The gooseneck and crossbar at Sportsfield Specialties are made of dense schedule 40 aluminum, while the uprights are made of a lighter 1/8-inch wall aluminum. When built, a goalpost, which is secured into the foundation using either a ground sleeve or a base plate depending on the stadium, should be able to withstand winds up to 115 miles per hour, and is tested by an outside team of engineers to ensure its compliance. “A standard goalpost is made up of four basic components: a base, called the 'gooseneck,' a crossbar and two uprights” “The uprights would be very heavy if you (used schedule 40 aluminum),” Moxley said, noting that each NFL goalpost weighs roughly 500 pounds even with the lighter material for the uprights. “The heavier stuff you put on top, the heavier it’s got to be at the bottom, so you’re looking for the lightest material possible that’ll still pass all the engineering criteria.” Each component comes to Sportsfield in the form of a straight, extruded pipe. From there, the piece that will become the gooseneck is cut to the correct length using an industrial saw and fed into a machine to be bent to the proper size. Standard NFL goalposts have a 6-foot offset, but some fields — primarily those that double as soccer fields — use posts with an 8-foot offset, so an entire goal can fit underneath the crossbar without running into the base. To bend the pipe, two heavy, computer-controlled rollers are used to manipulate the straight pipe into the particular shape inputted into the machine. Once that process is finished, the gooseneck and the other pieces, which are also cut to size, go through several steps of milling and welding, attaching joints and other components to prepare them for installation. “Let’s call it 50-50,” Moxley said of the split between the amount of work done by hand as opposed to by machine. “Because, while the machine is doing the bending and the drilling, you then have people who are doing the welding, and the cleaning of the product, getting it all ready to go to paint, and the paint process — even though the paint is the product that goes on, it’s very much about how you apply it. And not only that, but the machines wouldn’t be able to do what they do if people weren’t programming them.” The painting process is underway. After the welding is complete and the components are physically ready to go, they are painted using a technique called powder coating, in which a dry outer layer is applied using a tool called an electrostatic spray gun, then heated to cure the paint. Typically, goalposts come in either yellow or white. The NFL provides Sportsfield with two or three approved shades — essentially the same color, from different manufacturers — that can be used on their goalposts. Once the painting is done, the components are shipped to the field to be installed, at which point the teams or schools can hire a contractor or installer to set them up, or they can just do it themselves. The latter is one of the reasons Sportsfield uses aluminum in its goalposts as opposed to steel, which is still the metal of choice for some goalpost manufacturers. At many stadiums, the field is used for concerts and other events when football isn’t being played, so the ability to remove and replace the goalposts easily is crucial to the grounds crew. “It’s lightweight and gives transportability options to the stadium,” Moxley said. “Steel is obviously much heavier and has much more corrosive properties, meaning if the paint fails or there are any paint issues, the steel is going to be much less forgiving than the aluminum. So really it’s from a weight and finish standpoint, and an aesthetic standpoint.” All told, a set of goalposts costs between 7,000 and 14,000, depending on how many bells and whistles a team wants them to come with. (There are some that can be spun around in place, and others that can be raised and lowered using hydraulic pumps, for example.) And once installed, the shelf life of a goalpost can be as long as the team wants it to be, though they’re usually replaced about as often as when teams make other upgrades to the stadium or playing surface. It takes 15-18 hours to get a goalpost finished. “They probably last much longer than any of us would expect, minus the paint, which is always going to have some fade issues over time, and all of the things associated with mother nature that could hurt any product out in the field,” Moxley said. “So there is normal wear and tear, but as long as they can stand up to windload, they’re going to be fine for a very long time.” Of course there are always exceptions to the rule, especially at the college level, where fans sometimes celebrate a monumental win by snapping the goalposts or ripping them right out of the ground — a practice that, while not advisable, is more difficult than you think. “Like anything, if you put too much weight on it, it’s going to fall to the ground,” Moxley said. “The first concern is obviously everybody’s safety. We don’t want anyone climbing on anybody’s goalposts, for that matter, which I think is why the NCAA and NFL have all instituted fines if people access their field. But there’s probably not a great answer for (how easy they are to tear down). It’s going to vary by manufacturer and vary by material and foundation sizes, those types of things.” And then sometimes, goalposts all get replaced en masse, like they did earlier this year, when Sportsfield had to craft all new goalposts for each of its NFL clients after the league voted to replace the standard 30-foot uprights with 35-foot uprights. The change was referred to as the “Tucker Rule” by some, as it was thought to be inspired by Justin Tucker’s controversial game-winning field goal in a 2012 meeting between the Ravens and Patriots. The NFL passed the proposal to change the goalposts on March 26, and gave Sportsfield a completion date of Aug. 1, no easy task for Moxley and his team. “It wasn’t as simple as just putting five more feet on an upright; you had to go and re-engineer everything,” Moxley said. “So that was not only a unique challenge, but it had to be done in a timely fashion to get it done by the NFL-imposed deadline. It was a scramble to go to the stadium, get the outside measurements, meet with people and come back and make custom goalposts in almost every case.” But all the headache was certainly worth it for Moxley and Sportsfield Specialties, and after 600 extra points and 397 field goals through the first eight weeks of the 2014 season, the league’s most underappreciated, yet critical pieces are operating according to design. “It’s a very interesting business, and it’s great,” Moxley said. “It’s sports, and sports are fun.” You can follow Sam Gardner on Twitter or email him at samgardnerfox@gmail.com.

Paragraph: Some of the most memorable scenes in White Wilderness, Disney’s 1958 Academy Award-winning “True-Life Adventure” nature documentary about wildlife in the snowy northern portions of the North American continent, were ones featuring the death of lemmings who drowned after jumping off cliffs and into the sea. But the scenes shown in the documentary were staged by filmmakers in order to replicate supposed real-life behavior of lemmings that could not be captured on film, and thus did Disney perpetuate for generations to come the legend of periodic, inexplicable mass suicides by lemmings who die by hurling themselves off of cliffs. The narration in the film accompanying the lemmings scenes begins as follows: It is said of this tiny animal that it commits mass suicide by rushing into the sea in droves. The story is one of the persistent tales of the Arctic, and as often happens in Man’s nature lore, it is a story both true and false, as we shall see in a moment. What the audience then sees is what appears to be a horde of lemmings entering the Arctic sea by jumping off cliffs and scampering across rock-covered beaches to enter the water from the shore, whereupon they swim out to sea and (we’re told by the narrator) eventually drown — not quite because they’re simply committing suicide, the film states, but because they’ve supposedly mistaken the vast expanse of the Arctic sea for a lake and assumed there’s a reachable shore just across the water. A kind of compulsion seizes each tiny rodent and, carried along by an unreasoning hysteria, each falls into step for a march that will take them to a strange destiny. That destiny is to jump into the ocean. They’ve become victims of an obsession — a one-track thought: ‘Move on! Move on!’ This is the last chance to turn back, yet over they go, casting themselves out bodily into space … and so is acted out the legend of mass suicide. None of what was shown in the film was realistic lemming behavior, however. Disney’s White Wilderness was filmed the Canadian province of Alberta, which is not a native habitat for lemmings and is landlocked with no outlet to the sea. The filmmakers had to import lemmings to Alberta for use in the documentary (reportedly by purchasing them from Inuit children who had caught them in other provinces); through the use of carefully controlled camera angles and tight editing, the filmmakers made no more than a few dozen lemmings look like a much larger number, placing them on turntables to create a frenzied migration effect and then herding them off a cliff and into the water (which was actually the Bow River, not an Arctic sea). Nine different photographers spent three years shooting and assembling footage for the various segments that comprise White Wilderness, and it is not known whether Walt Disney approved or was aware of the activities of James R. Simon, the principal photographer for the lemmings sequence. Certainly nature documentaries are notoriously difficult to film as wild animals are not terribly cooperative, and many nature shows and films of this era (including Disney’s “True-Life Adventure” movies and the Wild Kingdom television series) staged events to capture exciting footage for their audiences. Nonetheless, in this case what was depicted on screen was a complete fabrication, not a recreation of real animal behavior that filmmakers were unable to capture on film. Lemmings do not periodically hurl themselves off cliffs and into the sea. Cyclical explosions in population do occasionally induce lemmings to attempt to migrate to areas of lesser population density, and when such migrations occur, some lemmings do die by falling over cliffs or drowning in lakes or rivers. These deaths are neither acts of “suicide” nor the result of compulsive unreasoning behavior, however; they’re accidental deaths resulting from lemmings’ venturing into unfamiliar territories and being crowded and pushed over dangerous ledges or venturing into the water in a quest to reach new territory. As the Alaska Department of Fish and Game noted in an article about this myth: “Disney had to have gotten that idea from somewhere,” said Thomas McDonough, the state wildlife biologist. Disney likely confused dispersal with migration, he added, and embellished a kernel of truth. Lemming populations fluctuate enormously based on predators, food, climate and other factors. Under ideal conditions, in a single year a population of voles can increase by a factor of ten. When they’ve exhausted the local food supply, they disperse, as do moose, beaver and many other animals. Lemmings can swim and will cross bodies of water in their quest for greener pastures. Sometimes they drown. Dispersal and accidental death is a far cry from the instinctive, deliberate mass suicide depicted in “White Wilderness,” but [the White Wilderness narrator] explains that life is tough in the lemmings’ “weird world of frozen chaos.” The voice-over implies that lemmings take the plunge every seven to ten years to alleviate overpopulation. “What people see is essentially mass dispersal,” said zoologist Gordon Jarrell, an expert in small mammals with the University of Alaska Fairbanks. “Sometimes it’s pretty directional. The classic example is in the Scandinavian mountains, where (lemmings) have been dramatically observed. They will come to a body of water and be temporarily stopped, and eventually they’ll build up along the shore so dense and they will swim across. If they get wet to the skin, they’re essentially dead.” Jarrell said when people learn that he works with lemmings, the mass suicide issue often comes up. Claim: Filmmakers staged lemming death scenes for the Disney nature documentary White Wilderness. Output:","completion":"The claim that filmmakers staged lemming death scenes for the Disney nature documentary White Wilderness is supported by evidence in the paragraph. Firstly, the documentary was filmed in the Canadian province of Alberta, which is not a native habitat for lemmings and is landlocked with no outlet to the sea. The filmmakers had to import lemmings to Alberta for use in the documentary, and they used controlled camera angles and tight editing to make a few dozen lemmings look like a larger number. They also placed the lemmings on turntables to create a frenzied migration effect and then herded them off a cliff and into the water, which was actually the Bow River, not an Arctic sea. Additionally, the film showed false lemming behavior, as they do not periodically hurl themselves off cliffs and into the sea, but rather migrate to areas of lesser population density, sometimes suffering accidental deaths in the process. The staged nature of the scenes in White Wilderness, therefore, supports the claim that filmmakers fabricated the lemming death scenes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: are there more species of Persea or Cryptotaenia Answer:","completion":"To answer the question about whether there are more species of Persea or Cryptotaenia, we need to delve into the taxonomy and classification of these two genera, as well as the current knowledge of the number of species within each group. Persea belongs to the Lauraceae family and includes various species of evergreen trees and shrubs, which are native to Central and South America, the Caribbean, North America, and Asia. Some of the well-known species within the Persea genus include Persea americana (avocado), Persea borbonia (red bay), and Persea japonica (Japanese avocado). The Persea genus is characterized by its aromatic leaves and fruits, which are used for culinary, medicinal, and ornamental purposes. Cryptotaenia, on the other hand, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Apiaceae family, also known as the celery or carrot family. Cryptotaenia species are perennial herbs, characterized by their parsley-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. They are mostly native to eastern Asia and North America. The most well-known species within the Cryptotaenia genus is Cryptotaenia japonica, commonly known as Japanese honewort or mitsuba, which is widely used in Japanese cuisine. Determining the exact number of species within a genus can be challenging, as new species continue to be discovered, and reclassification occurs as our understanding of plant genetics and phylogeny evolves. According to the current scientific literature and taxonomic databases, the number of species in each genus is as follows: 1. Persea: The number of species within the Persea genus varies between different sources, but it is estimated to include approximately 150 to 200 species. This variability in the estimated number of species can be attributed to the ongoing discovery and taxonomic revisions within the group. 2. Cryptotaenia: In comparison, the Cryptotaenia genus comprises a significantly smaller number of species. There are around 5 to 10 recognized species within the genus, with the possibility of additional species yet to be discovered or described. Based on the available information and taxonomic data, we can conclude that there are more species in the Persea genus than in the Cryptotaenia genus. The Persea genus, with its estimated 150 to 200 species, is significantly larger than the Cryptotaenia genus, which is currently known to include only around 5 to 10 species. Therefore, it is evident that the diversity of species within the Persea genus surpasses that of the Cryptotaenia genus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are essentially inquiring about the same information, which is the scientific proof or basis behind zodiac signs. Zodiac signs are primarily based on the position of the sun, moon, and planets at the time of a person's birth. The concept has its roots in ancient astrology, which sought to understand and predict events based on celestial bodies and their apparent motion across the sky. Astrologers divided the sky into twelve sections, each named after the constellation that occupies that region, and these have come to be known as the zodiac signs: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Although these signs have historical and cultural significance, it is important to note that there is little to no scientific evidence supporting the idea that the position of celestial objects at the time of birth has any direct influence on an individual's personality, behavior, or future events. The predictions and characteristics associated with zodiac signs are mostly anecdotal and have not been proven by empirical research. There has, however, been some scientific investigation into the field of astrology. Research has examined whether certain astrological aspects, like the sun and moon's positions in relation to one another, affect human behavior or physiology. While these studies have provided some interesting findings, they do not provide definitive proof of astrology's validity as a whole. Furthermore, astronomy and astrology have diverged significantly since their ancient shared origins. Astronomy is a rigorous scientific discipline that studies celestial objects, their motion, and the broader universe, whereas astrology is considered a pseudoscience or belief system based on anecdotal evidence that lacks empirical validation. It is essential to distinguish between these fields and to acknowledge that while zodiac signs form part of our cultural history and continue to be popular in horoscopes and astrology practices today, there is no substantial scientific proof to support the claims that a person's zodiac sign has any direct influence on their traits or destiny. In summary, while the concept of zodiac signs is rooted in astrology and the historical observation of celestial bodies, little to no scientific basis establishes a connection between zodiac signs and their influence on an individual's personality or life events. Therefore, it is prudent to view astrology and zodiac signs as a form of entertainment or personal belief rather than a proven scientific concept."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The situation becomes more complicated when it is revealed that Letty Ortiz (played by Michelle Rodriguez), Toretto's former love interest who was believed to be deceased, is very much alive and somehow connected to Shaw's crew. Motivated by this revelation, Toretto agrees to help Hobbs, reuniting his team of skilled drivers, consisting of Brian O'Conner (played by Paul Walker), Roman Pearce (played by Tyrese Gibson), Tej Parker (played by Ludacris), Han Seoul-Oh (played by Sung Kang), and Gisele Yashar (played by Gal Gadot).

When Sarah begs him to let them go so she can save her brother, he hesitates then lifts the barbed wire to let them out. Sarah and Rachel fall asleep in a dog house at a farm where they are discovered by the farmers, Jules and Genevieve Dufaure. Despite knowing who they are and the associated danger, the Dufaures decide to help the girls. Rachel is dying, and when they call attention to themselves by calling in a doctor, a skeptical German officer asks them if they know anything about a second Jewish child. The officer begins a search for the second child, only to be interrupted when the French physician carries out the dead body of Rachel.

He attended Long Beach Polytechnic High School, the same high school as future Philadelphia Eagles teammate Winston Justice and many other current NFL players. He became one of the top wide receiver recruits in the nation, with many collegiate football programs pursuing his services. He was named the 2004 Glenn Davis Award winner by the Los Angeles Times as Southern California's player of the year. Jackson attended the University of California, where he played for the California Golden Bears football team from 2005 to 2007. Wearing the number 1, in his first collegiate game against Sacramento State in 2005, he scored both an offensive and special teams touchdown, returning a punt 49 yards for a score. Throughout his freshman season, Jackson picked up 38 receptions for 601 yards along with seven touchdowns, eclipsing the 100-yard mark three times. In the 2005 Las Vegas Bowl game against BYU, Jackson tallied 130 yards and two scores. Jackson was also expected to play for Cal's baseball team but, due to the success of his freshman football season, he chose to focus exclusively on football. Coming into his sophomore year with high expectations, Jackson displayed more of his talent and playmaking ability, tallying 1,060 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. Jackson also returned four punts for touchdowns. He earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors as both a punt returner and a wide receiver. Jackson garnered national recognition with selections to first-team All-America by the Associated Press, Walter Camp Football Foundation, the Football Writers Association of America, the Sporting News, and Rivals.com as a punt returner. Jackson also captured the inaugural Randy Moss Award as the top returner in the nation. In one of only two California losses in Pac-10 play, Jackson had a 95-yard punt return for a touchdown against Arizona. Jackson entered his junior season being considered a Heisman Trophy candidate. His season began promisingly, with a 77-yard punt return for a touchdown against Tennessee in the opening game of the season. Against eleventh-ranked Oregon, he caught 11 passes for 161 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Bears to their first victory in Autzen Stadium since 1987. Jackson finished the 2007 season with 65 catches for 762 yards, and scored six touchdowns as a receiver. Jackson was named an All-American as a return specialist. Jackson suffered several minor injuries that limited his effectiveness at times during the season, along with a right thigh injury that forced him to miss most of the game against Washington and the Big Game against Stanford. He also missed the first quarter of the 2007 Armed Forces Bowl for violating undisclosed team rules. Jackson left Cal following the 2007 season and declared for the 2008 NFL Draft. He departed holding Pac-10 records for punts returned for a touchdown both in a season (four) and in a career (six). Jackson ranks third all-time at California for receiving yards with 2,423 and receiving touchdowns with 22. He is sixth in receptions (162). Jackson finished with 52 career plays of 20 yards or more, making up 23 percent of his 226 touches.

These can be wood or plastic.","completion":"Using a frame feeder is a practical and effective method to feed bees, and after choosing the right type for your needs, the next steps to properly feed bees involve selecting the ideal type of food, placing the feeder in the right location in the hive, monitoring the state of the feeder and ensuring the safety and well-being of the colony during the process. 1. Select the best food source: Beekeepers commonly feed bees with sugar syrup or a sugar supplement when natural food sources are scarce, such as during the winter months or in the early spring. When making sugar syrup, maintain a ratio of 1:1 in the spring, which means combining 1 part sugar with 1 part water, or 2:1 in the fall, which means 2 parts sugar with 1 part water. The appropriate ratio ensures that bees receive adequate nutrients and store enough food for the winter months. 2. Prepare the feeder: Before placing the frame feeder in the hive, it's important to clean it thoroughly. If it's a new feeder, rinse it with warm water to remove any residue or debris. If you've used it previously, disinfect the feeder with a weak bleach solution (10:1 water to bleach) and rinse with clean water. This helps to prevent cross-contamination of diseases among different colonies and maintain the bees' health. 3. Install the feeder: Place the frame feeder on the side of the beehive, replacing one or two frames to accommodate the space. Ensure that it is secured properly in the hive to minimize disturbance to the bees when refilling the feeder later. Make sure the side walls of the feeder are sealed to prevent any leakage that may create a mess in the hive. 4. Fill the feeder: Pour the sugar syrup or another supplement into the frame feeder, ensuring not to overfill the container or spill the syrup. Be cautious when filling the feeder to minimize potential harm to the bees. 5. Monitor the state of the feeder: Check the feeder every 3-7 days to replenish the food supply when necessary, while also verifying the feed level and whether bees consume the syrup at an appropriate pace. At the same time, inspect the general state of the colony and their overall health. 6. Provide an entrance for bees: If the frame feeder doesn't have a built-in entrance for the bees to access the sugar syrup, you can create one or modify it accordingly. For example, you can use a wooden or plastic stick as a float that bees can stand on to drink from the feeder, preventing them from drowning. 7. Safety measures and precautions: During the feeding process, it's essential to take certain measures to protect bees and maintain their overall well-being. Avoid opening the hive more often than necessary, as this can result in stress for the colony. Furthermore, feeding bees during warm hours of the day reduces the risk of chilling the brood, and working carefully near the hive prevents accidentally crushing bees. By following these steps, you can ensure that your bees are adequately and safely fed using a frame feeder, which in turn allows them to maintain their energy, thrive during the lean season, and produce honey for the rest of the year."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: What do plants lose the most of through the stomata?

Article: The Obama administration wants to require all employer-sponsored health insurance plans to cover contraceptives without co-payments. Some employers, largely on religious grounds, do not want to cover contraceptives in any form. Finding a middle ground between the two position is no easy task. It has become a vexing one for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, fraught with political and legal landmines. Final regulations published Friday demonstrate just how complex the process will be to deliver contraceptive coverage to the employees of religious nonprofits that oppose such medications. These regulations apply to only a small subset of employers: faith-based nonprofits, such as hospitals and universities, that oppose contraceptive use. All private employers are required to include contraceptive coverage in their benefits packages or face steep penalties. Health and Human Services has developed a six-step process for the faith-based nonprofits: 1. The faith-based nonprofit will not have to “contract, arrange, pay or refer” employees for contraceptive coverage. It will, however, need to notify its health insurance plan that it will not cover such benefits in its insurance plan. 2. The health insurance plan must then send a notice to these employees that it will be the one covering contraceptive benefits. And they have to be careful in how they do this. It needs to be “contemporaneous with…but separate from any application materials distributed in connection with enrollment in group health coverage.” 3. When employees use contraceptives, their coverage claims go to the health insurance plan, which pays for them. The health insurer is barred from using any of the premium dollars from the objecting employer to do this. 4. At the end of a year, the insurer calculates the money it has spent paying for contraceptives and sends that tally to the federal government. 5. The federal government looks at that number and adds some additional funds meant to cover the cost of administering the program. 6. The federal government gives the health insurer a discount on the fees required to sell on the federal health insurance exchanges commiserate with this determined amount. Federal officials say it should be at least a 10 percent cut. These rules cover the simpler situation of an objecting nonprofit. Some large companies “self-insure,” meaning they cover the entire cost of their health care costs and sometimes use a third-party administrator, rather than a traditional health plan, to administer medical spending. Third-party administrators (TPAs) don’t cover benefits, like contraceptives. So if an objecting employer comes to them, the TPA then has to find a health insurance plan to provide those benefits. Under this policy, insurers have the “opportunity to get full reimbursement for all costs of these benefits,” Michael Hash, director of the Office for Health Reform at HHS, says. “There will be full coverage for administrative costs, and a margin, so it’s a sound business opportunity.” Women’s health groups are happy with this approach. While complex, it does deliver on their key goal: maximizing access to contraceptives without a co-payment. Religious opponents of contraceptive coverage are unsatisfied, noting that these regulations look a lot like the previous rules the administration issued. Employers “will still have to provide abortion-inducing drugs or pay millions in fines,” Becket Fund deputy general counsel Eric Rassbach says. Now that the rule is final, it likely clears a path for legal action. Courts have held off on some decisions on these lawsuits, reasoning that changes could be made between preliminary and final regulations. Now that the regulation is out, these challenges have a big green light to move forward. ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story WASHINGTON — Despite strong resistance from religious organizations, the Obama administration said Friday that it was moving ahead with a rule requiring most employers to provide free insurance coverage of contraceptives for women, a decision that has touched off a legal and political battle likely to rage for another year. The final rule, issued under the new health care law, adopts a simplified version of an approach proposed by the government in February to balance the interests of women with the concerns of the Roman Catholic Church and other employers with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptives. After considering more than 400,000 comments, administration officials refused to budge on the basic principle. The rule, they said, is very similar to their proposal. An exemption is included for churches. But many Catholic hospitals, schools, universities and other religious institutions will have to take steps so that coverage is available to employees and their dependents. The issue figured prominently in last year’s elections as President Obama and other Democrats pressed their advantage with female voters. At the same time, Catholic bishops waged a national campaign arguing that the federal policy infringed on religious freedom and violated the church’s social and moral teachings on birth control and abortion. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan of New York, president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the group was reviewing the final rule. Democrats describe the mandate for coverage of birth control as one of the chief benefits of the 2010 health care law, a boon to women and their health. “The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost,” said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. “Today’s announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other nonprofit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage, while helping to ensure that women get the care they need, regardless of where they work.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Republicans say the requirement shows how intrusive and onerous the law is. The rule does not satisfy the concerns of certain religious organizations or businesses whose owners have religious objections to contraceptive coverage. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, said Thursday that the owners of Hobby Lobby, a craft store chain that describes itself as “a faith-based company,” could pursue their case against the rule. Eric C. Rassbach, a deputy general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which has represented plaintiffs in that case and others challenging the law, said the final rule did nothing to meet the objections of his clients. “The government tinkered with some mechanisms in the rule, but did not really get at the religious conscience questions,” Mr. Rassbach said. “So there is a fundamental conflict that will have to be resolved in court.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Under the rule, women are to have access to contraceptives without any premium, deductible, co-payment or other fees. Some religious employers do not want their employees to have coverage of contraceptives, even if someone else pays for it. A number of federal judges deferred decisions until the White House issued a final regulation. Publication of the rule clears the way for courts to act. Under the new health care law, employers with more than 50 employees will generally be required to offer health insurance to employees, or the employers will be subject to financial penalties. Among the “essential health benefits” that must be provided are preventive services. In particular, the administration says, most health plans must cover sterilization and the full range of contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including emergency contraceptive pills, like those known as ella and Plan B One-Step. Under the rule issued Friday, the government said certain “religious employers” — primarily houses of worship — may exclude contraceptive coverage from their health plans for employees and their dependents. In effect, they will be exempt from the federal requirement to provide contraceptive coverage. The rule also lays out what it describes as an accommodation for other nonprofit religious and church-affiliated organizations, like hospitals, universities and charities, that object to contraceptive coverage but do not qualify for the exemption. Under the rule, these organizations will not have to contract, arrange or pay for contraceptive coverage to which they object on religious grounds. Instead, the administration said, such coverage will be “separately provided to women enrolled in their health plans at no cost.” Under this arrangement, a nonprofit religious employer must notify its insurer that it objects to contraceptive coverage. The insurer must then notify people in the health plan that it will arrange or pay for contraceptive services as long as they remain in the health plan. Many employers serve as their own insurers and hire outside companies to administer benefits and pay claims. In such cases, the administration said, the “third-party administrator” must inform people in an employer-sponsored health plan that it is “providing or arranging separate no-cost payments for contraceptive services.” Administration officials said the cost of contraceptive services would, for insurers, be offset by savings that result from the fact that women would be healthier and will have fewer births. To reimburse third-party administrators for the cost of contraceptive services, the government said it would reduce the fees charged to certain health insurance companies for the privilege of selling insurance in federal marketplaces, or exchanges, being established in more than 30 states. Insurers will then be required to share some of those savings with third-party administrators for the self-insured health plans of religious employers that object to contraceptive coverage. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story The reduction in user fees would reflect the cost of contraceptive services, as well as “an allowance for administrative costs and margin,” or profit. The government would require third-party administrators to provide detailed information about the payments they made or arranged. Federal officials had difficulty explaining how these arrangements would work in practice. They said they were leaving the details to employers, insurers and third-party administrators. The Labor Department said it had the authority to require third-party administrators to provide, or arrange for an insurance company or other entity to provide, payment for contraceptive services. The final rule is the administration’s fourth attempt in 20 months to articulate a policy requiring contraceptive coverage. Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, said: “Today’s ruling strikes a fair balance between religious liberties and the reproductive rights of all women. Access to contraception shouldn’t be dictated by a woman’s employer.” But Patrick J. Reilly, president of the Cardinal Newman Society, which promotes Catholic education, said the final rule did not respect the religious freedom of religious employers. “Now the lawsuits can proceed,” he said. ||||| Hobby Lobby and a sister company will not be subject to 1.3 million in daily fines beginning Monday for failing to provide access to certain forms of birth control through its employees' health care plans, a judge ruled Friday. FILE - In this May 22, 2013, customers enter and exit a Hobby Lobby store in Denver. A federal appeals court on Thursday, June 27, 2013 ruled that Hobby Lobby stores have a good case that the federal... (Associated Press) U.S. District Judge Joe Heaton set a hearing for July 19 to address claims by the owners of Hobby Lobby and the Mardel Christian bookstore chains that their religious beliefs are so deeply rooted that having to provide every form of birth control would violate their conscience. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had said Thursday the companies were likely to prevail, comparing the companies to a kosher butcher unwilling to adopt non-kosher practices as part of a government order. Until the hearing, the government cannot impose fines against Hobby Lobby or Mardel for failing to comply with all of the Affordable Care Act. The companies' owners oppose birth control methods that can prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus, such as an intrauterine device or the morning-after pill, but are willing to offer the 16 other forms of birth control mentioned in the federal health care law. \\"The opinion makes it very clear what is a valid religious belief and what is not,\\" said Emily Hardman, spokeswoman for The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. The group is representing the companies and their owners, the Green family. Heaton asked the government and companies to seek some sort of solution before the hearing, given that the 10th Circuit has already cleared the way for the companies to challenge the law on religious grounds. While not binding beyond the states in the 10th Circuit, Thursday's ruling could benefit others that oppose all forms of birth control, Hardman said, such as Catholic hospitals. \\"We got a fantastic opinion from the 10th Circuit, which will impact all the cases,\\" she said. The companies had faced fines totaling 1.3 million daily beginning Monday. Had they dropped its health care plan altogether, they could have been fined 26 million. The only alternative would be to pay for birth control that violates its religious beliefs, the companies' owners said. The appeals court on Thursday had suggested the companies shouldn't have to pay the fines, but there were unaddressed questions pending at the lower court. Heaton resolved those Friday in the companies' favor: Hobby Lobby had shown they would suffer financial or spiritual consequences, and that an injunction was in the public interest. In fighting Hobby Lobby and other companies that oppose some or all forms of birth control, government lawyers had said companies cannot pick which portions of the Affordable Care Act with which they will comply. Spokesmen for the Department of Health and Human Services have repeatedly declined to comment on pending lawsuits over birth control coverage. Electronic court filings did not show any response from the government to Hobby Lobby's latest injunction request, but Heaton said in his order that lawyers from both sides had weighed in. Hobby Lobby's lawyers have said the U.S. Department of Human Services has granted exemptions from portions of the health care law for plans that cover tens of millions of people and that allowing the companies an injunction would be no great burden to the government at the expense of the Greens' religious freedoms. The companies' lawyers calculated potential losses at 475 million in a year _ 100 per day for 13,000 workers _ while harms to the government are \\"minimal and temporary.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"The Obama administration has been working on addressing the issue of employer-sponsored health insurance plans requiring contraceptive coverage without co-payments.

Step 2: Determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise Now, let's examine if \\"What lies before you\\" logically follows from \\"What is open to you\\". The premise states that certain opportunities, choices, or possibilities are available to you. However, these opportunities could exist at different times (past, present, or future) or in different aspects of your life. The hypothesis focuses specifically on the future. If we assume that the premise implies that there are opportunities open to you in the future, then there is a possibility that the hypothesis can be derived from the premise. But since the premise does not necessarily establish a temporal context, it is not guaranteed that the hypothesis always follows from the premise. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis In some instances, the premise may entail the hypothesis due to overlaps in the opportunities that are \\"open to you\\" and those that \\"lie before you.\\" However, as mentioned earlier, the premise does not explicitly establish a temporal context, so it is not guaranteed that the hypothesis always follows from the premise. In conclusion, while there may be instances where the premise \\"What is open to you\\" does entail the hypothesis \\"What lies before you\\", it is not a definitive or universal relationship between the two.

I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent. We had ‘Unexpected Song’ played as she walked down the aisle at the church; the lyrics really summed up how we felt about each other and how we had gotten together… Unexpected Song Michael Crawford YouTube. Question: When was the daughter born? Answer: A:","completion":"The daughter was born approximately a year after the couple got married, as they separated when she was 7 years old, after a roughly 8 year marriage.

We were sat down and given several different flavors. They all tasted pretty good. But the problems started when the \\"consultant\\" (which we now call the Mean-Order-Taking-Lady\\") stepped in. She was the least helpful person I've ever met in my life. She NEVER smiled once. When she saw that there was clearly confusion and questions, she didn't bother to step in once to help.

While the review mentions one positive aspect, which is the taste of the cake samples, the reviewer emphasizes their disappointment and frustration with the experience primarily due to the consultant's attitude and lack of helpfulness. The negative sentiment is evident in the use of strong language and descriptions while referring to the consultant, such as \\"Mean-Order-Taking-Lady,\\" \\"least helpful person,\\" and \\"NEVER smiled once.\\" The fact that the consultant was unhelpful, unresponsive, and dismissive despite the family's confusion and questions contributed to a negative and stressful experience for them. Moreover, the issue of not being informed about the deadline for the cake order until after all the stress and confusion further emphasizes the negative sentiment. Additionally, the review mentions other brides who had similar experiences at the same place, highlighting its dissatisfaction and frustration with the establishment. Lastly, considering the family's openness to potentially forgoing the package deal and finding a better place for their wedding cake indicates their overall dissatisfaction and negative sentiment towards this experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Six volunteers are about to find out what it would be like to live on Mars without ever leaving the Earth. Three men and three women will spend eight months living in a special place on the side of a volcano in Hawaii. They are part of an experiment that is designed to mimic life on Mars. Their mission began on October 15, 2014. NASA says it could send astronauts to Mars as early as the 2030s. The mission would take more than two years, so NASA needs to know how people would react to living in a small group, isolated from the rest of the world, for such a long time. Some people may become depressed or bored living under those conditions. By studying people living in similar conditions here on Eares NASA hopes to learn how to choose the most suitable people for a space mission, and how to help them get along. They will live in a two-story building. The ground floor is about 86 square meters, roughly the size of a small two-bedroom apartment. It includes shared areas like kitchen, dining room, bathroom, laboratory and an exercise room. The upstairs is less than half the size of the downstairs. It contains another bathroom and six small bedrooms. The building is located in an abandoned quarry about 2,400 meters up the side of Mauna Loa, the second biggest volcano in the world. It is constantly monitored for signs of volcanic activity. NASA chose the location because the appearance looks very similar to Mars. To make it more like being on Mars in the future, they are only able to communicate by email during the experiment. Meanwhile, there will be a 20-minute delay between the time when a message is sent and that when it is received. When they go outside, they will have to suit up in full spacesuits, just as if they were on Mars. The commander is Martha Lenio, a 34-year-old Canadian. During the mission, she will run experiments on growing food. The other members have backgrounds in physics and so on. None of them are astronauts. Question: When will the six volunteers end their mission about mimicking life on Mars? Options: A: On June 15, 2015. B: On October 15, 2015. C: On October 15, 2030. D: On June 15, 2032. A:","completion":"On June 15, 2015. The article states that the six volunteers will spend eight months living in a special place on the side of a volcano in Hawaii, and their mission began on October 15, 2014.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person whose talent was recognized by an award of £100 from the British Institution in 1828?, using the article: In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable..., what would be the answer ?

Q: The german physicist max planck (1858–1947) used the idea that atoms and molecules in a body act like oscillators to absorb and emit this? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Where is the quantization of energy observed? Let us begin by considering the emission and absorption of electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The EM spectrum radiated by a hot solid is linked directly to the solid’s temperature. (See Figure 29.3. ) An ideal radiator is one that has an emissivity of 1 at all wavelengths and, thus, is jet black. Ideal radiators are therefore called blackbodies, and their EM radiation is called blackbody radiation. It was discussed that the total intensity of the radiation varies as T 4 , the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body, and that the peak of the spectrum shifts to shorter wavelengths at higher temperatures. All of this seems quite continuous, but it was the curve of the spectrum of intensity versus wavelength that gave a clue that the energies of the atoms in the solid are quantized. In fact, providing a theoretical explanation for the experimentally measured shape of the spectrum was a mystery at the turn of the century. When this “ultraviolet catastrophe” was eventually solved, the answers led to new technologies such as computers and the sophisticated imaging techniques described in earlier chapters. Once again, physics as an enabling science changed the way we live. The German physicist Max Planck (1858–1947) used the idea that atoms and molecules in a body act like oscillators to absorb and emit radiation. The energies of the oscillating atoms and molecules had to be quantized to correctly describe the shape of the blackbody spectrum. Planck deduced that the energy of an oscillator having a frequency f is given by.

They could have accomplished the same thing in English. Very slow movie. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review tends to depict the product, presumably a film, in a predominantly unflattering light. The reviewer appears to be criticizing the film for its inclusion of an excessive number of subtitles and suggests that the same effect could have been achieved using English instead. Apart from that, the reviewer also mentions that the movie is slow-paced, which seems to further contribute to their unfavorable impression of the film. The primary concern of the reviewer seems to revolve around the usage of subtitles, which might stem from a preference for English dialogue over foreign languages or perhaps a difficulty in following multiple languages while watching a movie. This could lead to frustration and distraction from the overall viewing experience, ultimately resulting in dissatisfaction with the product. However, it is essential to consider that the inclusion of subtitles in a film might be an artistic choice made by the filmmakers to accurately depict a specific cultural context or to enhance the authenticity of characters in a given setting. In some cases, using a foreign language with subtitles can also add a layer of depth to the story and create a more immersive experience for the audience. In regard to the movie's slow pace, this criticism could be a matter of personal taste, as some viewers enjoy faster-paced films packed with action and continuous excitement, while others might prefer a more contemplative and slow-burning narrative that invites reflection. A slow-paced film does not inherently denote a lack of quality, but it may not cater to the preferences of all viewers. Overall, the review reflects an unflattering portrayal of the film in question, emphasizing the perceived negative aspects such as an overabundance of subtitles and a slow pace. However, it is crucial to note that the concerns raised by the reviewer might not be universally seen as drawbacks and could even be appreciated by other audience members with different tastes and preferences. In evaluating a film based on such a review, it is always advisable to consider both the reviewer's viewpoint and personal inclinations while exploring other sources of information and opinions to form a well-rounded understanding of the movie's merits and shortcomings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","completion":"(C). no Based on the given premise, \\"There is a lot of anger and sadness in the caves,\\" it can be deduced that the hypothesis \\"The caves are a happy place\\" is not true. The premise explicitly states that the caves are filled with negative emotions, such as anger and sadness. When trying to determine the validity of a hypothesis, it is essential to examine the evidence or statements provided. In this case, the premise provides information that conflicts with the hypothesis. To say that the caves are a happy place would require evidence that supports the presence of happiness or joy in the caves. However, the premise provided only refers to anger and sadness, which are considered to be negative emotions. Furthermore, since the premise only talks about the presence of these negative emotions, it is reasonable to infer that they are the dominant emotions in the caves. As the hypothesis directly contradicts the premise, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is not true. Thus, the appropriate answer to the question is (C). no.

Fact 2: Snails and slugs are invertebrates. Given the two facts above, what do snails and slugs lack? Possible answers: (a). eyes; (b). a nervous system; (c). kinetic energy; (d). Chlorophyll; (e). Energy.; (f). life; (g). a backbone; (h). Energy; Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts: Fact 1: Invertebrates are animals that lack a vertebral column, or backbone. Fact 2: Snails and slugs are invertebrates. We can infer that since snails and slugs are classified under invertebrates, they must also share the defining characteristic of this group which is the absence of a vertebral column or, more commonly referred to as a backbone. This anatomical feature is predominantly found in vertebrates, whose skeletal system is built around it. The backbone, or vertebral column, provides structural support for the body, protection for the spinal cord, and serves as an attachment point for various muscles, ligaments, and tendons. Now, let's discuss why the other possible answers are not correct: (a) Eyes: Although snails and slugs do have simple eyes, they primarily rely on their sense of touch and chemoreception rather than vision. Nonetheless, snails and slugs do possess eyes, so this option is incorrect. (b) Nervous system: Snails and slugs do have a nervous system, albeit a relatively simple one compared to organisms with a backbone. Their nervous system is made up of a brain-like structure called a ganglion and nerve cords that run throughout their bodies. This allows them to sense their environment, move, and perform necessary activities for survival. (c) Kinetic energy: Kinetic energy relates to the energy of motion and is applicable to all objects and animals that are in motion. Snails and slugs possess kinetic energy when moving, making this option incorrect. (d) Chlorophyll: Chlorophyll is the molecule found in plant cells that helps in the photosynthesis process. As snails and slugs are animals, not plants, they do not possess chlorophyll. (e) & (h) Energy: All living organisms, including snails and slugs, require some form of energy to carry out their life processes. They gather energy through consuming other organisms in their diet. Therefore, this option is incorrect, as snails and slugs do possess energy. (f) Life: Snails and slugs are alive and exhibit the various characteristics of life, such as growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli. Hence, this option is also incorrect. Based on the information provided, we can deduce that the correct answer is: (g) A backbone"},{"prompt":"Q:This is a correct answer to the following question about Kurt Cobain. Yes or no?

The phrase suggests that the subject's behavior or a situation was not authentic or possibly not effective in its intended purpose. In most contexts, when something or someone is described as being melodramatic, it can be taken as a negative criticism of overly dramatic behavior, which is typically not a desirable trait. Additionally, this kind of exaggerated emotional expression can make it difficult for others to take the person or situation seriously. While the word 'melodramatic' does not convey an overtly negative or harsh judgment, the main connotation associated with it leans more towards the negative side.

If this sentence were to appear in a broader context where the dramatism of the subject was appreciated or needed, it might have a more neutral or slightly positive connotation. For example, if the sentence referred to an actor's performance in a heightened, theatrical production, being described as 'more melodramatic' might be taken as a compliment to the actor's ability to convey intense emotions.

He is best known for these three aforementioned roles, all of which have contributed to his successful career as a popular and respected actor in the entertainment industry. 1. Ray Doyle: Martin Shaw first rose to prominence by playing the role of Detective Sergeant Raymond \\"Ray\\" Doyle in the iconic British television series “The Professionals.” The show aired on the ITV network from 1977 to 1983 and followed the adventures of a fictional crime-fighting unit called CI5 (Criminal Intelligence 5), which dealt with serious crimes and threats to national security.

This article: While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate. He had already fathered a son, Carl August Nielsen, in January 1888, before he met Anne Marie.

Is \\"The success of Zwingli's Reformation in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 (Wars of Kappel).\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, your statement about the success of Zwingli's Reformation in some cantons leading to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531, known as the Wars of Kappel, is correct. However, to provide a detailed and long answer, it's essential to outline the background, key events, and consequences of these conflicts. Background: The Wars of Kappel were a result of the tensions between the Swiss cantons that had adopted Protestantism, spearheaded by Huldrych Zwingli, and those that remained staunchly Catholic. During the early 16th century, the Swiss Confederation was a loose alliance of thirteen autonomous cantons. Zwingli's Reformation started in Zurich, which was the first canton to adopt his teachings in 1523, and quickly spread to other cantons such as Bern, Basel, and Solothurn. As Reformation efforts gained momentum, tensions between Protestant and Catholic cantons inevitably arose. First War of Kappel (1529): The First War of Kappel was primarily sparked by disputes over territories and resources, such as access to alpine pastures, with religious differences only adding fuel to the fire. Concerned by the growing tensions, the Catholic cantons of Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Zug, and Unterwalden formed an alliance called the Christian Union in 1529. The two sides faced off at Kappel am Albis pass, but the war ended without any significant battles. Instead, the First Peace of Kappel was negotiated, which averted the immediate crisis by guaranteeing the rights of the cantons to choose their religion. The treaty also allowed specific territories to be divided according to religious belief. Second War of Kappel (1531): However, this uneasy peace did not last long. The tensions between the two religious groups continued to rise as both sides sought to strengthen their alliances and extend their influence. Tensions reached a boiling point when the Catholic cantons accused Zurich and Bern of violating the First Peace of Kappel by trying to force their beliefs on the territories that had been divided. On October 11, 1531, the Catholic cantons launched a surprise attack on the Protestants. Caught off guard, the Protestant forces hastily assembled to defend themselves, but Huldrych Zwingli was killed in the Battle of Kappel, which ultimately led to the Protestants' defeat. The Second Peace of Kappel was then established, which gave more concessions to the Catholic cantons and affirmed the principle of each canton freely choosing its religion. While the religious division remained, the Wars of Kappel effectively halted the Reformation's expansion in Switzerland, leading to a more or less permanent divide between the Protestant and Catholic cantons. In summary, the Wars of Kappel can be attributed to both inter-cantonal religious differences and disputes over resources in the Swiss Confederation. The conflicts ended with a fragile balance of power between the two religious factions, but they ultimately limited the spread of Protestantism in Switzerland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As has been said before, this film essentially uses its title character as a point of departure; its portrayal of her life and person have little or nothing to do with the real Artemisia Gentileschi. The script is awful -- pretentious, stilted, and vapid -- and its rewriting of the facts is unusually offensive even in a genre that all too often makes its living by distorting, rather than retelling, history. Along with some fairly decent set design, Valentina Cervi's physical charms are the primary asset of this movie, and it's obvious from the beginning that the filmmakers were aware of this too; they waste no time in contriving various \\"erotic\\" sequences which have far more to do with titillation than with plot or character development. Unfortunately, the appeal of seeing a pretty young girl in a state of feigned sexual arousal cannot, and does not, sustain this movie. The acting is unremarkable, and the score is all too generic despite an interesting chord or two. The cinematography is OK, and there are some pretty colors, but there are also some pretty ridiculous sequences using distorted-lens effects more appropriate for a 1960s freakout movie than a costume drama. In any event, the script leaves the camera dwelling all too often on Artemisia's body, and all too seldom on her paintings. All told, a near-complete failure. It's not intelligent or tasteful enough to be a serious film, and it's too slow and pretentious to work as soft-core pornography. So the French can fail, after all!

Answer the above question based on the context below: The island's proximity to the river and the ocean suggests that the area is suited to fishing and related activities, yet the indigenous people, mostly land-dwellers, have long been content to practise artisan fishing, just to supply their own daily needs. Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance, which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers. Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, the four ways oysters are cooked by the Jola people are: 1. Boiled: Oysters are cooked in boiling water and usually consumed with a spicy sauce. This method helps in retaining the texture and the natural taste of the oysters. 2. Grilled: Oysters are placed on a wood fire and grilled until they reach the desired level of doneness. This technique imparts a smoky flavor to the oysters, which is enjoyed with a spicy sauce. 3. Sun-dried: For sale or preservation, some oysters are dried in the sun. This dehydration process allows for longer shelf life while also concentrating their flavors. 4. Smoked: Similar to sun-drying, oysters are smoked to preserve them and to intensify their taste. This process involves exposing the oysters to smoke from burning wood, resulting in a distinctive smoky flavor. These cooking methods not only enable the Jola people to enjoy the nutritional benefits of oysters but also allow them to preserve them for later consumption and sell them in markets, providing a source of income and financial independence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary was unhealthy for the physical. (B). Felicia was unhealthy for the physical.","completion":"Mary always lived a better lifestyle most of the time unlike Felicia, so the assumption could be made that option (B) would be more fitting. Felicia was unhealthy for the physical. While Mary was fortunate to lead a healthy life, Felicia's lifestyle was less conducive to maintaining a good physical condition. This unhealthy lifestyle manifested in different areas of her life and affected her overall well-being. Firstly, Felicia's diet was less than optimal. Unlike Mary, who always made sure to consume a balanced and nutritious diet, Felicia favored convenience and instant gratification when it came to food choices. As a result, her diet often consisted of fast food, processed meals or takeout options, and snacks high in sugar and unhealthy fats. This unbalanced diet led to deficiencies in essential vitamins and minerals and put her at risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and heart problems. Secondly, Felicia did not prioritize incorporating regular exercise into her routine. Whereas Mary made sure to work out and stay active throughout her day, Felicia's sedentary lifestyle made her more susceptible to weight gain and the health problems associated with it. Moreover, lack of exercise can lead to a higher risk of chronic conditions like hypertension, joint problems, and even mood disorders. In addition to her poor dietary and exercise habits, Felicia's addiction to smoking took a significant toll on her physical health. The dangers of smoking are well documented, and this harmful habit likely contributed to her deteriorating lung function, increased risk of respiratory problems, and potentially life-threatening illnesses like cancer. Lastly, the stress factor cannot be overlooked. Felicia seemed to be constantly under stress, whether from work, personal relationships, or financial struggles. Unlike Mary, who practiced effective stress management techniques like meditation and seeking support from loved ones, Felicia allowed stress to consume her, exacerbating her unhealthy lifestyle choices. Long-term stress has negative impacts on health, including weakening the immune system, causing digestive problems, and increasing the risk of heart disease. In conclusion, Felicia was unhealthy for the physical due to a combination of factors, including poor diet, lack of exercise, harmful habits like smoking, and chronic stress. Conversely, Mary's lifestyle choices consistently prioritized her physical and mental well-being.

Unbeknownst to Juliet, someone is stalking her, observing her from across the street and apparently entering her apartment. At a party, Juliet bumps into Max and flirts with him.

Summarize the following: Meanwhile, prepare a 9-inch by 5-inch (23-cm by 13-cm) loaf pan by lightly greasing the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray or shortening. Alternatively, you can use two 8-inch by 4-inch (20-cm by 10-cm) loaf pan. Make sure that the total loaf pan volume can hold 8 cups (2 L). To further prevent sticking, consider lightly dusting the bottom of the pan with a little flour after greasing it. You may also use parchment paper, but using aluminum foil since the foil can cause quicker browning and uneven cooking for this recipe. In a large bowl, mix together the flour and sugar until evenly combined. Depending on your personal sense of taste and the lemon-lime soda used, you may need to alter the amount of sugar. If you have a notably sweet soda or prefer blander bread, cut the sugar back by 1 Tbsp (15 ml). If you have a mild soda or strongly prefer very sweet bread, consider adding another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar. Pour the carbonated soda over the dry ingredients and mix well using a mixing spoon or clean hands. Lightly knead the dough in the bowl until it comes together. Note that the dough will likely be somewhat lumpy. Do not attempt to knead out all the lumps since over-mixing the dough can cause problems with the finished texture. For a blander bread, consider using club soda instead of lemon-lime soda. You can experiment further by using different flavors of carbonated soda, but each different flavor will have a different effect on the final taste of the bread. Transfer the dough into your prepared loaf pan. Use your hands to spread it out evenly over the entire pan. Pat on the top surface to flatten it out. If using two loaf pans instead of one, evenly divide the dough between the two. Place the filled loaf pan in the oven and bake the bread until the top turns light golden-brown. This will usually happen after 45 minutes, but some ovens may require additional bake time. Remove the finished bread from the oven. After 10 minutes, remove the loaf from the pan and allow it to continue cooling on a wire rack. Enjoy slightly warm to room temperature. The finished bread will be somewhat crumbly and chewy, with a flavor somewhat reminiscent of homestyle biscuits. You can slice it thin or thick.","completion":"First, get a loaf pan ready and make it non-sticky. You can use one big pan or two smaller ones. Mix flour and sugar in a big bowl. You can change the sugar amount to make the bread taste how you want. Then, add bubbly soda and mix it with the flour and sugar. Don't mix it too much, it's okay if it's lumpy. If you want, you can try different flavors of soda too. Put the dough in your pan and make it flat. Put the pan in the oven and bake it until it's light golden-brown, usually about 45 minutes. When it's done, take it out of the oven and let it cool down. The bread will be a little crumbly and chewy, like a biscuit.

An amateur horsewoman has been found crushed to death at stables after her favourite horse is thought to have slipped and fallen on top of her. The body of 35-year-old Sarah Neal was discovered at the isolated yard on Tuesday evening. It is believed she suffered a fatal heart attack when the horse landed on top of her. Tragedy: Sarah Neal, 35, was crushed to death when she fell from her horse near Aldermaston, Berkshire. It is not clear if this was the horse involved in the incident. It was not known how long Ms Neal had lain dying at the stables in Mortimer West End, near Aldermaston, Berkshire, before she was discovered in the dark just before 8.30pm. Paramedics rushed to the stables, just a short distance from the Red Lion public house, following a 999 call from the police. A spokesman for the South Central Ambulance Service said that paramedics carried out resuscitation attempts on the woman but were unable to revive her. Her body was taken to the mortuary at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, where a pathologist was expected to carry out a post mortem examination. Today, Ms Neal's parents Jennifer and Christopher, were said to be 'in bits and too devastated' to talk about their daughter after hearing news of her death. Her brother James answered the door at his parents' modern three-bedroomed semi-detached on a quiet estate in West Berkshire. Paramedics rushed to the stables, just a short distance from the Red Lion public house, following a 999 call from the police and discovered Sarah's body. 'Mum's in pieces at the moment,' he said 'It all happened so suddenly. We are still trying to come to terms with it all.' Ms Neal's father, Christopher, had been telephoning relatives and loved ones letting them know the tragic news. Ms Neal was a bridesmaid to James' new wife Patricia at his wedding in 2010. Friends said that the single woman had been riding horses since she was a child and took part in equestrian events at the weekends. At 4pm yesterday just hours before the tragedy, Sarah posted on her Facebook status update 'Bored!' She had posted lots of photographs of her horses Rosie and Tim on it. As the news of her death filtered through to her friends devastated friends left memorial messages to her. Schoolfriend Jenny Abery posted: 'RIP Sarah xxxxxx this must be such a shock for your family, my thoughts go out to them. I found a picture of you and I as kids the other day riding our ponies in Bradfield together, happy memories xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Totally shocked :(' Friend Michelle Ivermee said: 'RIP Sarah I am going to miss you ar the yard never forgotten, love Michelle xxxx' George Hastie posted on her Facebook page: 'Sarah, such a tragic sad loss, you will be missed at the yard-Such a lovely bubbly person, Rest in Peace xxx' Steve Price said: 'Dear Sarah you are already sadly missed, dappy, funny, witty, bloody hard worker, never complaining, never had a compliant, loved and miss by all who touched you.

Here is how you can proceed: Step 1: Read the Sentence Understanding the sentence you have to translate is important. Make sure you are clear with all terms before moving to translate. Step 2: Understand Quranic Terms Understand the specific Quranic terms like 'Revelation', 'Faith', 'Straight Way', etc., used in the sentence. These terms have specific meanings in the context of the Quran and Islam which may be different from their everyday English use. Make sure your translation into Persian also reflects the religious depth of these terms. Step 3: Translate the Sentence Now, begin translating. Start word by word. You can either use your knowledge of the Persian language or employ tools like online dictionaries or translators. Be aware though that not all tools may fully capture the intended religious and philosophical depths of the Quranic terms. If you are unsure about any religious or context-specific terms, consider asking a knowledgeable friend or consult with more seasoned translators. Step 4: Check the Grammar After translating, make sure your grammar makes sense in Persian. The sentence structure in Persian may not always be the same as English. Ste 5: Final Check Finally, read out the translated sentence to see whether the translation is smooth and makes sense in Persian. Ask someone who is a native speaker if possible to do a final check. They might be able to spot mismatched applications of context or help refine the translation to sound more natural to Persian speakers.

The 2015 -- 16 PBA season is the 37th season of the franchise in the Philippine Basketball Association ( Barangay Ginebra San Miguel ) .","completion":"Although both sentences convey similar information, there are subtle differences in the structure and the presentation of the details. Here's a detailed examination of each sentence: 1. The PBA - Season 2015 -- 16 is the 37th season of the franchise at the Philippine Basketball Association (Barangay Ginebra San Miguel). In this sentence, the focus is on the \\"PBA - Season 2015 -- 16,\\" clearly indicating that it refers to the 2015-2016 season of the PBA. The sentence then goes on to mention that this season is the \\"37th season of the franchise,\\" referring to the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel team. Additionally, the use of the preposition \\"at\\" implies that this is the 37th season the team has participated in the league or the association. 2. The 2015 -- 16 PBA season is the 37th season of the franchise in the Philippine Basketball Association (Barangay Ginebra San Miguel).

The sentence then states that this season is the \\"37th season of the franchise,\\" again referring to the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel team. However, the use of the preposition \\"in\\" implies that this is the 37th season the team has been a part of the league or the association. Although both sentences convey the same information, the second sentence is more concise and follows a clearer structure. The first sentence puts the emphasis on the \\"PBA - Season 2015 -- 16,\\" while the second one directly mentions the \\"2015 -- 16 PBA season.\\" Another difference is the use of the prepositions \\"at\\" and \\"in,\\" which may slightly affect the interpretation, though the context implies the same meaning. In conclusion, both sentences provide information about the 37th season of the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel franchise in the Philippine Basketball Association during the 2015-2016 season.

Believing that Ray's soul still inhabits the doll, Tiffany crudely stitches it back together and reenacts the voodoo ritual which instilled Ray inside the doll ten years ago. The incantations seemingly fail to produce results, but Chucky suddenly springs to life and kills Tiffany's Goth admirer Damien while Tiffany looks on with excitement. Later, Tiffany and Chucky have an argument because Tiffany believed that Chucky wanted to marry her. Upon learning he had no intention of doing so, Tiffany locks Chucky in a playpen, and gives him another doll in a wedding dress to make fun of him. Chucky escapes the play pen and kills Tiffany by electrocuting her. He then uses the same voodoo ritual to transfer her soul into the bride doll so she could feel what he went through as a living doll. Still intent on becoming human again, Chucky plans to retrieve the magical amulet that was buried with Ray's body, and use the bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse and his girlfriend Jade as hosts for their souls. Tiffany sends Jesse a message asking him to transport the two dolls to New Jersey in exchange for money. Jesse convinces Jade to go with him.

When you dont have a lot of energy, you may sit around and do very little. A similar thing happens to particles of matter as energy is added. The more energy there is, the faster the particles of matter move. Energy is also the reason you are able to move around. In fact, matter is always in motion. It can even change from one form to another. For example, electrical energy can be converted into heat energy. You see this every time you use the toaster. Energy causes a change in matter when you lift your arm. Energy can be used to move matter. You use energy to take a step to move forward. Thanks to energy, your body moves.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. and the situation: Burr township is situated on the western side of the ridge, at a lower altitude, and is experiencing atmospheric convection every once in a while, while Jolt township, on the eastern side, has a less windy, less cloudy environment and is situated at a higher altitude. Answer the following question: Which township is experiencing fewer tornadoes? Answer:","completion":"Jolt township is experiencing fewer tornadoes compared to Burr township. Step-by-step justification: 1. Atmospheric convection is more common in Burr township, as it is situated at a lower altitude on the western side of the ridge. This results in a higher frequency of unstable conditions, which includes increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. 2. In contrast, Jolt township is situated at a higher altitude on the eastern side of the ridge, and experiences a less windy, less cloudy environment. This indicates that the conditions for atmospheric convection are less favorable in Jolt township as compared to Burr township. 3. The background information mentions that moist convection can lead to thunderstorms, which are often responsible for severe weather like hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. 4. Since atmospheric convection occurs more frequently in Burr township, it is more likely to experience thunderstorms and the associated severe weather, including tornadoes. Based on these steps and the given background and situation, Jolt township is experiencing fewer tornadoes due to its less favorable environment for atmospheric convection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Obama Steps Into O’Reilly’s ‘No Spin Zone’ It was billed as the ultimate smackdown, and it certainly promised to be a wonk vs. wacko match: the cerebral, conciliatory Senator Barack Obama versus Bill O’Reilly, Fox News Channel’s most irascible, combative anchor: a commentator who calls liberals “loons” and “pinheads” and on Thursday’s show described reporters scrutinizing Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as “sniveling, left-wing, wine-drinking, brie-eating.” The topic was national security, and their tone was civil, but thankfully not too civil: Mr. O’Reilly, as is his wont, spoke brusquely, interrupted, argued and didn’t let his guest off the hook. He told Mr. Obama he had “bloviated” in parts of his convention speech, but congratulated him on his early opposition to the war, saying he had been “perspicacious.” Mr. O’Reilly then demanded that his guest admit that he was wrong to oppose the military surge. Mr. Obama didn’t give in; he repeated previous qualifications but did go farther, and less equivocally, than before in acknowledging that the surge had worked. “It’s succeeded beyond our wildest dreams,” he said. Mr. Obama is known for the subtlety and nuance of his answers; Mr. O’Reilly has no patience for either. And accordingly, they had a bracing exchange, in what was the first of four segments to be spread over four days. Mr. Obama has talked to Fox News reporters quite a few times since the primaries began: he sat down with Chris Wallace in April. But this was his first appearance on “The O’Reilly Factor,” and its host has had a prickly relationship with the Obama campaign. Mr. O’Reilly has had to apologize for an unfortunate turn of phrase when discussing Michelle Obama, played videos of the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. early and often, and is still underscoring Mr. Obama’s association with William Ayers, a member of the violent Weather Underground in the 1960s (a topic Mr. O’Reilly gleefully said would be debated in Monday’s segment). Mr. Obama gave no hint of rancor and remained pleasant, respectful and good-humored, but he did adjust his pace and wording to suit his speed-talking host.","completion":"Senator Barack Obama appeared on Fox News Channel's \\"The O'Reilly Factor,\\" hosted by Bill O'Reilly, an irascible and combative anchor.

When you think of documentaries, you may think of them as long, boring programs. But documentaries can be wonderful and bring stories from the real world into our homes. With fascinating footage and stories, documentaries encourage us to think about interesting issues we wouldn't necessarily know about. So, what makes a good documentary, and what should we pay attention to when we watch one? Here, we offer a few easy strategies to help you get the most out of watching documentaries. Pay attention to the themes While watching a documentary, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the themes people talk about and what ideas they focus on. Is it meant to be informative or raise a certain emotional response? Think critically Listen to what the people in the documentary are saying and ask yourself the following questions: If you were debating with someone or introducing a new concept, would you say the things the people in the documentary are saying? Do the arguments make sense? Check the sources If you're sitting at the computer and can't think of anything to do, why not look up the points the documentary made and see if they are accurate?

We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

In nuclear physics, nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei come close enough to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons). The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as the release of large amounts of energy. This difference in mass arises due to the difference in atomic \`\`binding energy'' between the atomic nuclei before and after the reaction. Fusion is the process that powers active or \`\`main sequence'' stars, or other high magnitude stars. the energy from nuclear fusion is produced by the conversion of mass to energy? Options: - no - yes","completion":"Yes, the energy from nuclear fusion is produced by the conversion of mass to energy. This process follows the famous equation formulated by Albert Einstein, E=mc², where E represents energy, m represents mass, and c represents the speed of light in a vacuum. This equation demonstrates the principle of mass-energy equivalence, illustrating the relationship between mass and energy, and showing that the matter can be converted into energy and vice versa. During nuclear fusion, lighter atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus; this typically occurs with isotopes of hydrogen, like deuterium and tritium. In the process of fusion, a small amount of mass is lost due to the conversion of some of the nucleons' mass into binding energy, which holds the newly formed nucleus together. This lost mass is then converted into energy, primarily as kinetic energy of the released particles and in the form of electromagnetic radiation, such as gamma rays. The high energy yield generated during nuclear fusion is a result of the intense binding energy released as lighter nuclei join to create heavier elements with more tightly bound protons and neutrons. The difference in binding energies between the initial nuclei and the final products determines the total released energy. This conversion of mass to energy is the primary reason stars, including the Sun, can generate immense amounts of energy over extended periods. It is also the same principle behind the development of fusion-based power generation concepts, such as fusion reactors, which strive to harness the vast amounts of energy produced by the nuclear fusion process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the morning of the incident, Armstrong had become somewhat separated from her group of five fellow swimmers, including her husband. A witness onshore reported seeing a shark, roughly 11 feet long, attack her. However, the rest of her group did not witness the attack. They later joined together in an attempt to keep the shark at bay in spite of the fact that it did not directly attack them, according to a local police inspector. Following the attack, an extensive search was conducted to locate Armstrong, but it was described as \\"fruitless\\" by the AP. Eventually, the search was called off, as Australia's ABC News reported that partial female remains were discovered. However, it has not yet been definitively confirmed whether the remains are linked to the shark attack. The sudden and unexpected tragedy has left the community in shock, and Armstrong's husband, who had been with her since they were kids, is taking it very hard.

As a result, several possible scenarios may unfold in their lives, including buying a house, being spouses, and falling in love. A. Buy a House: Ash and Quinn, as a married couple, may decide to buy a house together to establish their home and start the next chapter of their lives. This step would typically involve finding a suitable neighborhood, deciding their budget, and collaborating to choose a house that meets their requirements. By purchasing a house, Ash and Quinn build a stable and secure foundation for their future together. B. Be Spouses: Upon marrying Quinn, Ash enters a long-term, committed relationship with her. As spouses, Ash and Quinn will share both the joys and challenges of life, fulfilling their respective roles as partners. This partnership may involve supporting each other emotionally and financially, working together to reach common goals, and facing various life decisions as a team. As spouses, they will likely develop a deeper understanding of each other's strengths, weaknesses, and needs, nurturing their bond over time. C. Fall in Love: By establishing a strong connection with Quinn that led to their marriage, it's highly plausible that Ash has already fallen in love with her. Love, of course, can continue to evolve and grow even after marriage, as Ash and Quinn continue to experience new things together, learn from each other, and work towards shared ambitions. Falling deeply in love can enhance their connection, trust, and compatibility, ultimately strengthening their relationship as a married couple. Considering the different possibilities, it is reasonable to assume that Ash and Quinn will experience a combination of the mentioned scenarios. They will likely be spouses, fall in love (and maintain that love), and potentially buy a house together, as these are all common and natural aspects of a married couple's life journey. The individual experiences for them may vary, but overall, these scenarios capture a comprehensive sense of what may unfold in Ash and Quinn's married life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kate comes to the conclusion that they are in the heart of a large crocodile's territory and that it will be more aggressive than usual. The tourists realize that by nightfall, the tide will start to rise and in a matter of hours, their small island will be submerged. Neil and Collin arrive soon after, and as they near the island, an unseen force, smashes their boat and sinks it. Neil manages to swim to the island safely, but Collin disappears. As night falls, Neil suggests that he swims to the riverbank in order to string a rope between two trees, creating a zip-line that will allow the group to cross the river. Neil succeeds in setting up the rope and Mary Ellen (Caroline Brazier) crosses first, only to freeze in fear halfway across.

He adds some cooked pasta into the porcini sauce with some reserved pasta liquid. he","completion":"then proceeds with the following logical steps to complete the dish and serve it: 1. Incorporating flavors: As the chopped porcini mushrooms are now mixed with the cream and seasonings, he lets the sauce simmer gently for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. The low heat will enable the porcini mushrooms to release their earthy and woodsy flavors. Additionally, allowing the cream sauce to simmer will also help thicken it slightly, making it a better consistency to coat the pasta. 2. Add cooked pasta and adjust seasoning: Once the porcini cream sauce has reached the desired consistency and flavor, he adds the cooked pasta into the sauce, making sure the pasta is well coated. He can use a type of pasta that has a good surface area to hold the sauce well, like fettuccine, pappardelle, or tagliatelle. If needed, he adds some reserved pasta liquid to adjust the consistency of the sauce so it's neither too thick nor too thin. The starchy pasta water also helps the sauce cling to the pasta even better. At this stage, he tastes the dish and adds more seasoning (salt, pepper, or other herbs) if needed. 3. Adding cheese and extras: To make the dish even more indulgent, he can add grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese at this point, stirring it into the pasta and sauce until it melts and combines well. Optionally, he could also add some toasted nuts, such as pine nuts or walnuts, for added texture and flavor. 4. Finish with fresh herbs: To add some freshness and extra aroma to the dish, he can sprinkle it with some fresh herbs like chopped parsley, basil, or thyme, right before serving. These herbs will not only add depth to the dish but also enhance its visual appeal. 5. Plating and garnishing: He then plates the pasta dish, ensuring that each plate has an equal portion of pasta and sauce. He can use a fork and spoon to twirl the pasta, making it sit in a neat nest-like shape on the plate. For the final touch, he can add an extra sprinkle of cheese and herbs or a drizzle of good quality olive oil. 6. Serving and enjoying the meal: Now that the porcini mushroom pasta is ready, he can serve it as a main course or as a side dish to accompany a protein, such as grilled chicken or seared steak. A crisp salad or some sautéed vegetables would also pair well with the dish. By following these steps, the meal will have a delicious balance of flavors and textures from the earthy porcini mushrooms, rich cream sauce, and al dente pasta. It's a perfect example of Italian comfort food that can be enjoyed by anyone who loves indulging in flavorful and satisfying dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Harkins believes such successes are not only inspiring their colleagues but \\"a new generation of kids coming through\\". \\"If you go back 10 years, there would only be a couple of Scottish athletes in the GB team and those athletes have inspired a generation of the next athletes,\\" he told BBC Scotland. \\"It was unprecedented that we have 15 athletes at the Olympics in Rio last year and six athletes at the Paralympics.\\" However, Harkins did not anticipate increased government funding as a result. \\"I find that hard to imagine in the current economic climate, particularly when they are talking about cuts across the board,\\" he said. \\"We can only hope that, if athletics is doing well, our money will not be cut.\\" Meanwhile, Harkins believes Muir, who plans to double up again at this year's World Championships, could go on to become one of Scotland's greatest-ever athletes. \\"She certainly has the ability and the characteristics for that,\\" he said while praising the hard work put in by the 25-year-old and her coach. \\"She's had this potential for a number of years, but to deliver the performances that she did and the manner in which she did them over the weekend is absolutely amazing. \\"It is great credit to the work Andy Young has been doing with her.\\" Find out how to get into athletics with our special guide.

The sport has since seen a rise in popularity with more talented athletes emerging from the nation, leading to increased representation in international sports events like the Olympics and Paralympics. These achievements have brought renewed hope and inspiration to Scottish athletes and the younger generations. Muir earned gold medals in both the 1500m and 3000m events, while McColgan took bronze in the 3000m and Doyle secured silver as part of Britain's 4x400m relay squad. As a result, experts believe that Scottish athletics is moving into an unprecedented era with several talented athletes - like Muir, McColgan, Steph Twell, Andy Butchart, Callum Hawkins, and Lynsey Sharp - contributing to its success. Moreover, promising young athletes are emerging in the throwing, sprinting, and endurance disciplines. The success of Scottish athletes on the international stage in recent times has encouraged a new generation to pursue athletics. A decade ago, there were only a few Scottish athletes on the GB team, but the number has since grown with increasing representation in the Olympics and Paralympics. However, increasing government funding to support these accomplishments remains uncertain due to the current economic climate and talk of spending cuts. Rodger Harkins, director of coaching for Scottish athletics, believes that Laura Muir could become one of Scotland's greatest-ever athletes, thanks to her outstanding performance and hard work, along with the dedication of her coach Andy Young. Former European medallist Lee McConnell also praises Muir's achievements and believes that she is among Scotland's all-time best athletes.

While my parents were busy running their small business, there were many nights when Grandma fed me and put me to bed in her spare room, until they came to get me. I spent my summers at Grandma's and I went everywhere with her. I couldn't imagine a time when she wouldn't be around me. Then November 1, 1991 began her month-long stay in the hospital--she suffered from a rare infection called nocardia asteroides. After being born in the year of the Great Depression, living through World War II, raising three kids, and being widowed at the age of 48, Grandma never expected to live into her seventies. The infection in her brain seemed to confirm that she wasn't long for this world. But that's not the end of her story. A team of doctors successfully removed the abscess , and Grandma even made it into a local medical journal. Her doctor called her \\"the brain lady\\".

He was the son of Yehuda Leib Schneersohn , who founded the Kopust dynasty . He succeeded his father immediately following his death in 1866 . He is the author of the 1902 text Magen Avot . He had a son Yehuda Leib . - Rebbe or , is a Yiddish word derived from the Hebrew word \\"rabbi\\", which means \\"master, teacher, or mentor\\". Like the title \\"rabbi\\" it refers to teachers of Torah or leaders of Judaism. - The Torah (\\"instruction, teaching\\"), or in Christianity, the Pentateuch (\\"five books\\"), is the central reference of the religious Judaic tradition. It has a range of meanings. It can most specifically mean the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, and it usually includes the rabbinic commentaries ('). The term \\"Torah\\" means instruction and offers a way of life for those who follow it; it can mean the continued narrative from Book of Genesis to the end of the Tanakh, and it can even mean the totality of Jewish teaching, culture and practice.

Article: On my first day in America, I was excited, but nervous as well. It was my dear neighbor Susan who helped me get used to my new life far away from home. There was a knock at the door. When I opened it, Susan came in with a home-made apple pie. She hugged me and said:\\"You must be the precious Chinese doll!\\" With a big smile, she went on:\\"Alice, I am sure you have never, ever tried a home-made apple pie before! You are going to love it so much!\\" To be honest, I was greatly surprised by this welcome from a stranger. And the apple pie made me feel at home. Susan was very helpful to me. When I was thinking about a costume to wear on Halloween, she suggested I dress up like a traditional Chinese girl. \\"I happen to have a traditional Chinese dress and guess what, I am a great make-up artist!\\" she said. Susan didn't hide her excitement, when, after an hour of hard work, she pushed me to the mirror to examine our work. The clothes fit me perfectly! I am sure that I _ from the crowd that Halloween, and I am very grateful to Susan for her help. My first Thanksgiving was another highlight. On the festival morning, I was surprised to find a gift box in my front yard. There was a note on it:\\"Hello Alice, I am the Thanksgiving bunny! Enjoy your gift!\\" I looked around and caught Susan looking at me from the porch. Seeing that she had been caught, she awkwardly picked up a newspaper and pretended to read it. I couldn't help laughing. When I walked up to her, she said:\\"It was not me. It was the Thanksgiving bunny!\\" Susan is such a lovely person; she is the American above all others I need to thank. I saw that the spirit of the Chinese saying, that \\"Neighbors carry more weight than distant relatives,\\" is alive and well in America. Susan filled my heart with warmth and joy, just as angels do.

Can you tell me the answer to how many teams advance to the next round in world cup??","completion":"To provide you the answer to how many teams advance to the next round in the FIFA World Cup, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the structure of the tournament, including the number of teams participating and the format of the competition. 2. Analyze the first round, which is the group stage, to determine how many teams advance from each group. 3. Calculate the total number of teams that advance to the next round, which is the knockout stage. Step 1: The FIFA World Cup has a total of 32 teams participating (at least until the 2026 edition, when it will expand to 48 teams). The tournament is divided into two main stages; the group stage and the knockout stage. Step 2: During the group stage, the 32 teams are divided into eight groups of four teams, labeled Group A to Group H. Each team plays the other three teams in its group once, accumulating points for wins and draws. The teams are then ranked based on points, goal difference, and other tiebreakers. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage. Step 3: As there are 8 groups, and the top 2 teams from each group advance to the knockout stage, we just need to multiply the number of groups by the number of teams advancing. 8 groups x 2 teams = 16 teams So, 16 teams advance from the group stage to the knockout stage in the FIFA World Cup."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Definition: \\"For Hayek, however, the word 'totalitarian' signifies something very specific: the want to “organize the whole of society” to attain a “definite social goal”\\". Step 1: Investigate the definition The given definition focuses on two central ideas: 1. Organizing the whole of society 2. Attaining a definite social goal Step 2: Compare the definition with Hayek's ideas Friedrich August von Hayek, an Austrian-British economist and philosopher, was a prominent critic of central planning and totalitarianism. His book, \\"The Road to Serfdom,\\" emphasizes the dangers of governments trying to control and plan all aspects of society, especially in the pursuit of specific social goals. The given definition aligns with Hayek's ideas in that it identifies the organization of society and the aim to achieve a social goal as key components of totalitarianism. Hayek believed that this central control over the distribution of resources and decision-making would lead to the erosion of individual freedoms and ultimately result in an oppressive, totalitarian society. Step 3: Evaluate the accuracy of the definition Considering Hayek's ideas and the congruence of the given definition, it is accurate to say that \\"For Hayek, however, the word 'totalitarian' signifies something very specific: the want to “organize the whole of society” to attain a “definite social goal”\\". This captures the essence of his views on the dangers of central planning and the threat it poses to liberty and individual freedom.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: Step 1: Research the cultural and historical context of the practice of putting coins over the eyes of dead people. Step 2: Christians, as well as some other cultures, have historically put coins over the eyes of the deceased as a tradition based on ancient beliefs. Step 3: The practice can be traced back to ancient Greek and Roman cultures, where it was believed that the deceased would have to pay the ferryman, Charon, to transport their soul across the River Styx to the afterlife. Step 4: The coins served as the required payment for this journey and would ensure a smooth transition to the afterlife. Step 5: Although modern Christians may not believe in paying the ferryman, the practice has persisted as a cultural tradition and sign of respect for the dead. Answer to Question 2: Step 1: Consider different approaches for engaging atheists in religious conversations, such as logical arguments, personal stories, or moral perspectives. Step 2: Initiating respectful conversations, keeping an open mind and patiently listening to their beliefs might create opportunities to share your Christian beliefs. Step 3: Highlight positive aspects of Christianity, such as the sense of community, love, and support that can be found in faith. Step 4: Be prepared to address common criticisms and misconceptions about Christianity by using logical and well-thought-out answers.

Article: SCOTTSVILLE, Ky. (WKRN) – A 38-year-old man was arrested in the murder of a young girl in Kentucky. Kentucky State Police said Friday that Timothy Madden is now facing charges of kidnapping, rape, sodomy and murder in Gabriella “Gabbi” Doolin’s death. The 7-year-old was reported missing at 7:40 p.m. during a little league game at Allen County Scottsville High School and found dead at 8:05 p.m. in a small stream of water nearby. According to an arrest warrant, Gabbi was raped, manually strangled, and drowned. “Biological evidence,” or DNA, found on her body is what led police to Madden, the warrant states. Madden is being held on 1 million bond in the Barren County jail. Authorities said he is being housed alone at the jail. News 2 cameras were rolling as Madden was led to a sheriff deputy’s car Friday afternoon. When asked what he had to say, Madden replied, “I’m sorry for their loss but I’m innocent.” “Ever since we got the call last Saturday night, the people who work for the state police, along with the people from the Allen County Sheriff’s Department and the Scottsville Police Department have worked tirelessly to bring this matter to the point where we are today,” said Captain John Clark with Kentucky State Police. A source confirmed to News 2 that Madden is a local father of five children and attended high school with victim’s father, who is the same age. The source also said he was sitting near the family the night of her disappearance. The investigation is ongoing. Kentucky State Police asked for the community to continue to pray for the Doolin family. Friday night, the Scottsville Police Department said on Facebook the Doolin family donated flowers and food in the wake of Madden’s arrest. “We are in disbelief to the kindness they have shown us as they are going through so much that we can never comprehend,” the department wrote. “Our personal message to them: We respect your tact, grace, and faith as you go through the most painfully difficult times in your lives. Our prayers and hearts are with you all. We will never understand the magnitude of your grief, but we do grieve and hurt with you.” There will be a hearing for Timothy Madden on Monday, Nov. 23. ||||| Timothy Madden (Photo: Barren Co.

It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Given the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Tropomyosin is a protein that winds around the chains of the actin filament and covers the myosin-binding sites to prevent actin from binding to myosin. Tropomyosin binds to troponin to form a troponin-tropomyosin complex. The troponintropomyosin complex prevents the myosin “heads” from binding to the active sites on the actin microfilaments. Troponin also has a binding site for Ca++ ions. To initiate muscle contraction, tropomyosin has to expose the myosin-binding site on an actin filament to allow cross-bridge formation between the actin and myosin microfilaments. The first step in the process of contraction is for Ca++ to bind to troponin so that tropomyosin can slide away from the binding sites on the actin strands. This allows the myosin heads to bind to these exposed binding sites and form cross-bridges. The thin filaments are then pulled by the myosin heads to slide past the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere. But each head can only pull a very short distance before it has reached its limit and must be “re-cocked” before it can pull again, a step that requires ATP.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

U.K. ended death penalty 49 years ago At a synchronized moment 50 years ago, two convicted killers dropped into the hereafter when gallows trap doors gave way at English prisons 35 miles apart. Gwynne Evans, 24, swung at Walton Prison in Liverpool. His partner in crime, Peter Allen, 21, was executed just to the east at Manchester's Strangeways Prison. The hangings on Aug. 13, 1964, were payment in kind for a robbery-murder that the men connived and committed four months earlier, on April 7. Except for the killers’ ineptitude, the case was not remarkable. It was murder most ordinary. But the executions would mark an end to the British law of talion, based on the ancient idea of retributive justice — an eye for an eye. Poor timing and bad choices placed Evans and Allen in the crime history books. They were petty criminals, stealing scrap metal and vending machine coins. Evans had twice washed out of the military, and he couldn’t keep a civilian job, either. At age 19 he changed his name (from John Walby) to try to obscure his slacker past, but he wasn’t able to change his nature. Thieving came naturally, followed closely by handcuffing. Allen had a similar resume: brief military service and a string of sackings from dirty-knuckle jobs in trucking and agriculture. His bad habit was stealing cars. Allen had married in 1961, at age 18. Two years later, as they struggled financially, he and his wife decided to rent a room in their flat in the gritty Lancashire city of Preston. Gwynne Evans came knocking just after Christmas 1963, and Evans and Allen soon were stealing together. They weren’t very good at it, despite years of practice. They stole a van, planning to use it to haul booty. But they got caught and hauled into court, where a judge levied a 10 pound fine against each man. That meager debt became the impetus for murder. Facing jail time as the default date approached for payment of the fine, Evans came up with a plan. In 1960, Evans had worked briefly at a laundry service in Workington, 100 miles north of Preston. A coworker, John West, had been the subject of break-room gossip. A middle-aged bachelor, West had spent more than three decades driving laundry delivery trucks. He was rumored to be gay and to have a small fortune concealed in his house. So on April 7, Allen pinched a car, a tiny Ford Prefect, and he and Evans set off to rob John West. Squeezed into the back seat were Allen’s wife, Mary, and their two toddlers. They arrived at West’s after midnight. Evans went inside while the Allen family waited in the car. “I knocked on Mr. West’s door and he said, ‘I didn’t expect to see you tonight,’” Evans later told police. “He asked me to go to bed with him.” Evans got comfortable. He removed his coat and spent an hour or more in the house. He was eventually joined by Allen, who ordered West to turn over his imagined fortune. At 3 a.m. neighbors heard thumping and wailing. A few minutes later, the little Ford scuttled away in a hurry. Police found John West’s body in the morning. Naked below the waist, he had been bashed 25 times with a metal rod, then stabbed in the heart. The killers sprinkled clues everywhere. Allen asked a friend if he could abandon the stolen Ford on his property. The friend called police, who linked the car to the Workington murder. Evans left his coat at the murder scene. In a pocket police found a medallion inscribed with Evans’ name. They also found the name and address of a Liverpool teenager who had dated him. Following some elementary detective work, the men were behind bars 34 hours after the murder. “It started off as an innocent robbery,” Allen confessed. He said West “made a lunge at me” after he was called into the house by Evans. “I panicked, drew back my fist and hit him,” Allen said. “The next thing I can remember is seeing Gwynne hitting West with a bar.” Both were charged with capital murder. Convicted killers routinely faced the death penalty in Britain for more than two centuries. But the public’s appetite for capital punishment diminished after World War II. The U.K.’s Homicide Act of 1957 had limited the use of hanging to the most heinous criminals, including serial killers and those who murder law enforcers. Executions were rare by 1964. But Evans and Allen qualified under a provision of the law that allowed execution of those who killed during commission of a theft. After a brief trial, a jury surprised the defendants by sentencing them to “suffer death.” Even after appeals were denied, many observers expected Home Secretary Henry Brooke, the final arbiter, to recommend commutation of the sentences to life in prison. But the case in the northwest hinterlands drew no attention from the London press, and the executions were carried out with little national notice. Two months later, the Labor Party defeated the ruling Conservatives, and the new government abolished the death penalty 49 years ago today, on Nov. 9, 1965.

The case marked the end of the British law of talion, which is based on the ancient idea of retributive justice. There was a growing opposition to capital punishment following World War II, and the UK's Homicide Act of 1957 limited the use of hanging to only the most heinous criminals. However, Evans and Allen qualified for execution under a provision of the law that allowed execution for those who killed during a theft. Eventually, the death penalty was abolished in the UK 49 years ago on Nov. 9, 1965, with Evans and Allen being the last to be executed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I suffer from an illness that causes me to have regular bouts of vertigo. These present as bad balance, walking around stumbling a little bit, needing to steady myself. This same illness also makes me slur my speech on occasion. So the other day I was at a dinner with my wife and her parents and I got up to go to the bathroom. It was a bad day illness wise so I was stumbling a fair bit and my speech wasn’t at all clear. I tripped and fell over in the restaurant and it was a bit of a scene. After the restaurant we went back to their house, my wife drove my car because of my episode and I swear I saw them exchange a look of “I told you so” when I handed her the keys. We were staying with her family overnight because we live about two hours away, and didn’t want to drive four hours for a dinner in one day. So her mom turns on the news and we all settle in. At some point during the evening both of my in laws had excused themselves to the kitchen, and a bit later I went to get myself some water, still having trouble walking but not quite as bad as earlier. I over heard them say “[my name] is absolutely trashed, I can’t believe it, our daughter married a drunk”. I knew right then that this was why they’d disapproved of me our whole marriage. They thought I’m an alcoholic! I walked right in and demanded to know what they were talking about, and then just lost it. I told them I knew they thought I’m an alcoholic, that I’m drunk right now, and that I’m not. My FIL laughed in my face and said “son you’re slurring right now why don’t you go to bed we can talk in the morning” and I just LOST IT. I started yelling at them, why the fuck would you assume I’m lying about this, hasn’t wife told you about my illness, I’m sick of being treated like a degenerate because I’m fucking sick, etc etc. This isn’t an uncommon reaction to seeing someone with my illness, and I just let out all of my frustration from every time I’ve been treated like a drunkard because of it. There was name calling and four letter words and honestly from the time I started to the time I stopped I don’t think they said a single word. I only stopped when my wife came in and intervened. They then said that I had to leave their house immediately, so me and my wife are staying at a motel tonight.

Logic test: Jay was skating on the cement, but when he got to the grass he slowed down to a stop. This is because grass has (A) higher friction (B) lower friction. Answer:","completion":"Based on the logic test, your students should choose answer (A) higher friction. Here is a detailed explanation: The statement, \\"Jay was skating on the cement, but when he got to the grass he slowed down to a stop,\\" suggests that there is a difference in how easily Jay was able to skate on the two surfaces. The given options, (A) higher friction and (B) lower friction, are related to the force that resists the relative motion or tendency of motion of two surfaces in contact. Friction plays a vital role in the motion of an object when it is in contact with another surface. In simple terms, friction provides the resistance against the movement of an object across a surface. In this case, the object is Jay's skateboard, and the surfaces are grass and cement. Cement is generally a smooth surface, and when Jay was skating on it, he probably experienced relatively low resistance to movement. However, when Jay moved onto the grass, the resistance to the motion of his skateboard increased, causing him to slow down and eventually stop. Grass is a rougher surface compared to cement, and the increased resistance that Jay experienced on the grass came from the higher friction between the skateboard and the grass. When there is higher friction, it requires more force to maintain motion across a surface. Consequently, as Jay moved from cement to grass, the increased friction between his skateboard and the grass caused him to slow down and eventually stop, as his momentum was not enough to overcome the frictional force. So, based on the logic test presented, the suitable answer for your students to choose is (A) higher friction. This is because the grass, being a rougher surface, has higher friction compared to the smoother cement surface, which led to Jay slowing down and stopping as he transitioned from skating on cement to grass."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The U.S. election calendar could be a key factor in determining the scope and timing of a potential deal to end the North Korean nuclear program. Planning is progressing for both the upcoming summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in at the end of April and the expected meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim in late May or early June. President Trump said Tuesday that there had been talks at “extremely high levels” between his administration and the North Korean government. Later it was reported that Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and a secretary of state nominee, met recently with Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. Trump also noted the talks have been marked by “a lot of goodwill” and that “there has been a major change in terms of North Korea’s behavior,” since Kim’s Olympic outreach this year, in which he sent a large delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter games in South Korea, suspended nuclear and missile tests, and expressed a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. The turn toward diplomacy has reduced, for now, the potential for conflict over the North’s accelerated efforts last year to develop an operational nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. The North Korean leader’s decision to engage in denuclearization talks was likely motivated by both Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, which increased sanctions and the threat of military action against the North, and by South Korean President Moon’s reassuring outreach efforts to improve inter-Korean relations. Trump’s motivation in pursuing a nuclear deal with North Korea, in addition to resolving a growing national security threat, could also have a political component. According to North Korea analysts at the Sejong Institute in South Korea, the Trump administration is likely calculating how achieving such an agreement could help boost the president’s chances for re-election in 2020. “If I were Trump, I...

Through proper organization and distribution of tasks, companies can focus on areas that require more attention and prioritize efforts accordingly. In the case of renewing framework contracts, for example, an organized approach can help ensure that resources, time, and attention are directed to the necessary areas to guarantee a proficient and effective renewal process. Without organization and division of work, businesses and projects can easily become chaotic, inefficient, and unable to achieve their projected goals. This can lead to wasted resources, reduced effectiveness, and ultimately, a decline in staff morale and productivity. Thus, prioritizing tasks and ensuring a methodical approach to work can prevent potential roadblocks and disruptions, allowing for a smoother, more streamlined operation. Several factors contribute to fostering an organized and structured work environment: 1. Clear Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of individual team members ensures that all tasks are allocated, and accountability is established. This process can prevent overlapping work and confusion, as each team member is aware of their expectations and responsibilities. 2. Effective Communication: Open, transparent, and efficient communication among team members and organizational levels is paramount to prevent misunderstandings, share information, and coordinate work efficiently. 3. Time Management: By setting realistic timelines for tasks and projects, organizations can manage expectations and allocate resources effectively. Proper planning and management of tasks can help teams stay on track and ensure that work is completed in a timely manner. 4. Regular Progress Updates: By providing regular updates on the progress of work, organizations can maintain a cohesive understanding of where they stand in relation to their goals, and address any issues or delays that may arise. 5. Continuous Improvement and Adaptability: Organizations must be prepared to adapt and evolve as needed. Striving for continuous improvement, refining processes, and adapting to changes will enable businesses to thrive in a competitive market and tackle any challenges that may arise. By implementing these principles, an organization can build a solid foundation for effective division of work and prioritization, ultimately leading to more proficient outcomes across various areas, such as contract renewals. The right balance of coordination, communication, and structure will not only speed up the workflow but also contribute to organizational success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Heidi investigated John ate the cauliflower.","completion":"The given sentence, \\"Heidi investigated John ate the cauliflower,\\" is neither syntactically nor semantically acceptable. To better understand why, let's examine the sentence's structure and meaning. Syntax refers to the arrangement of words and phrases in a sentence that adheres to grammatical rules. In this sentence, the syntax is problematic due to several issues: 1. Word order: The sentence comprises two different actions - \\"Heidi investigated\\" and \\"John ate the cauliflower.\\" However, these two parts are incorrectly combined, leading to confusion in understanding the proper sequence of events. 2. Sentence structure: The sentence lacks proper connectors or punctuation that could separate the two distinct actions or link them together. Consequently, the ideas presented in the sentence appear to be unclear. Semantics refers to the meaning conveyed by a sentence. In this case, the semantics are unclear due to the problematic combination of the two actions: 1. Intended meaning: It can be inferred that Heidi investigated something related to John eating the cauliflower. However, the sentence does not effectively communicate what aspect of the eating event Heidi is investigating. 2. Ambiguity: The sentence's meaning is not easily comprehensible due to the juxtaposition of unrelated actions. This ambiguity makes it semantically unacceptable. To improve the syntactic and semantic acceptability of the sentence, it can be rephrased using appropriate conjunctions or punctuation. Here are a few examples: 1. Heidi investigated whether John ate the cauliflower. (This version clearly indicates the relationship between the two actions. The investigation focuses on determining if John ate the cauliflower.) 2. Heidi investigated the case, and John ate the cauliflower. (This sentence separates the two actions with a conjunction, making it syntactically and semantically acceptable. It is understood that both actions occurred but are not inherently connected.) Remember, a syntactically and semantically acceptable sentence should be easily understood, follow grammatical rules, and clearly convey its intended meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the passage. LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the first splinters of sunlight spread their warmth on the south bank of the River Thames on Thursday, it became clear that after more than a century, the vision of Victorian engineer Alexander Stanhope St. George had finally been realized. The Telectroscope lets Londoners and New Yorkers see each other in real time. In all its optical brilliance and brass and wood, there stood the Telectroscope: an 11.2-meter-(37 feet) long by 3.3-meter-(11 feet) tall dream of a device allowing people on one side of the Atlantic to look into its person-size lens and, in real time, see those on the other side via a recently completed tunnel running under the ocean. (Think 19th-century Webcam. Or maybe Victorian-age video phone.) And because the artist also happens to have an expertise in","completion":"optical engineering and a penchant for merging art and technology, the Telectroscope not only stands as a marvel of Victorian-inspired design but also represents a culmination of years of scientific research and innovation. The intricate network of mirrors, lenses, and fiber-optic cables housed within the device's beautifully crafted brass and wood exterior enables the real-time transmission of live images between London and New York, facilitating a remarkably unique connection between these two bustling metropolises. The creator behind this extraordinary contraption, the artist-scientist Paul St. George, has dedicated much of his life to the pursuit of bringing his great-grandfather Alexander Stanhope St. George's dream to life. Alexander's original designs and patents, discovered by Paul amongst a collection of aged, crinkling documents, served as the foundation on which the Telectroscope was built and guided Paul every step of the way during its development. The initial response to the Telectroscope has been nothing short of awe-inspiring. Crowds of excited onlookers gather daily on both sides of the Atlantic to catch a glimpse of this historic marvel of technology. Children and families press their faces against the glass and wave excitedly at their counterparts across the ocean, delighted by the prospect of instantaneous transatlantic communication. The success of the Telectroscope has left many pondering the implications of such a groundbreaking innovation. Educators, for example, have eagerly embraced the potential of the technology to foster cultural exchange and understanding by incorporating it into their curriculums, while some business owners have expressed interest in using it as a means of conducting international meetings without the need for expensive and time-consuming air travel. However, not everyone is as enthusiastic about the rapid advancement of technology. Critics argue that the growing reliance on such devices may begin to erode the essence of human interaction and fundamentally change the way in which society communicates. They worry that people may begin to favor the convenience of the Telectroscope over the beauty and nuance of face-to-face conversations, which could lead to a decline in empathy and a weakening of human connection. Despite these varied perspectives, one thing remains certain: the Telectroscope has captured the hearts and minds of people around the world, serving as a powerful testament to human ingenuity and the ability to bridge the gap between imagination and reality. As we continue to move further into the 21st century and beyond, it will, no doubt, be fascinating to see the ways in which the Telectroscope and other technological advancements shape the landscape of interpersonal communication and further transform the world in which we live."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Parents are often amazed at how fast their child grows and develops. New research has determined that the ability to quantify may develop much sooner than most parents realize. Kristy vanMarle, professor of the University of Missouri, has determined that contrary to what previous studies have shown, infants are able to quantify substances --like sand or water--as early as 10 months. As long as the difference between the two substances is large enough, infants will choose the larger amount, especially when it comes to food. With the assistance of her team researchers, vanMarle tested the quantifying skills of babies by presenting them with two cups: one containing a small amount of food, and one containing a larger amount. Consistently, the babies chose the larger amount. \\"Several studies throughout the last 15 years have shown that infants are very good at telling how many objects they see; however, infants don't seem to count things like water or sand,\\" vanMarle said. \\"What we're saying is that they can quantify substances; The infants can see how much food goes into each cup and compare that in their memories. They decide which amount is larger, and they almost always select the larger one.\\" This information further refutes the long-held idea that babies \\"know nothing of the world,\\" vanMarle said. \\"Since psychologists have begun studying infants with sensitive measures, we've discovered a lot of early abilities. I think for parents, it should be exciting to know that there's somebody there that has some fundamental and basic knowledge of the world, and that knowledge is guiding their development,\\" vanMarle said. In the future, vanMarle says this kind of study could be linked to a child's progress in math-related skills, although programs marketed to increase those abilities, such as \\"Baby Einstein,\\" still have mixed reviews when it comes to academic study.

Help as much as you can. Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of the people who wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear? During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him.","completion":"The full names of the people who wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear are U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews and Sergeant Allen Isaac."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There were 66 people on board when the Airbus A320 crashed on 19 May while flying from Paris to Cairo. It vanished from Greek and Egyptian radar screens, apparently without having sent a distress call. \\"The signal from a beacon from a flight recorder has been detected,\\" said Remi Jouty of France's Bureau of Investigations and Analysis. A priority search area has been established, he added. Laplace is using acoustic detection systems to listen to the locator \\"pings\\" given off by the black boxes underwater. A specialist vessel carrying robots able to dive to 3,000 metres (3,280 yards) is due to arrive next week. Egyptian investigators first reported that the French vessels had picked up signals from the wreckage search area, saying they were \\"assumed\\" to be from one of the devices. Officials from the country said last week signals from the plane's emergency beacon had been detected but later said they were received on the day of the crash and were not new. What caused the crash remains a mystery. Finding the black boxes is crucial to piecing together what happened in the plane's final moments. A militant attack has not been ruled out but no extremist group has claimed the downing of the plane. Human or technical error is also a possibility. Flight data revealed that smoke detectors went off in the toilet and the aircraft's electrics, minutes before the plane's signal was lost. Black boxes emit signals for 30 days after a crash, giving search teams an ever-narrowing window to locate them before their batteries run out. Debris from the plane has been recovered from the sea, some 290km (180 miles) north of the Egyptian port city of Alexandria. But the bulk of the plane and the bodies of passengers are thought to be deep under the sea. Those on board MS804 included 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.

Photographer Park Jongwoo gained unconditional access, becoming the very first official photojournalist to enter the land separating North and South Korea. In 2010, on the 60th anniversary of the Korean War, the South Korean Ministry of National Defense invited Park to document the DMZ, an area normally inaccessible to civilians and of which no comprehensive photographic record existed. Park’s photographs show the stark contrast between the military presence (seen through barbed wire, outposts, and armed troops which have led to sporadic violence), and the natural beauty of the DMZ. Park Jongwoo said: “There is no actual ‘border,’ like a barbed wire fence, between the South and North inside DMZ. “You can run into North Korean patrols any time. Some locations are within firing range of the North Korean soldiers, there is no time for taking any picture in these spots.” “In the early morning, you could see the North Korean soldiers tired from last night’s guard nodding off, trying to get rid of head lice, or raising crops due to insufficient food supplies. You would not imagine them to fight in a war properly,” Jongwoo said. Today the DMZ is recognized as one of the world’s best-preserved temperate habitats and home to several endangered species of flora and fauna. Park Jongwoo’s ‘DMZ: The Demilitarized Zone of Korea’ was published in September 2017 by Steidl. Available to buy here. ||||| A Canadian naval commander is in charge of monitoring one of the world’s most dangerous borders. Commander Robert Watt is the chief of staff for the United Nations Command (UNC) Military Armistice Commission, a little-known military contingent which was set-up seven decades ago to supervise the ceasefire between North and South Korea. “There’s no other military unit I’ve served in that does what we do,” Watt told Global News during a visit to the South Korean side of the Demilitarized Zone. The DMZ is a 245-kilometre-long and 4-kilometre-wide buffer that separates North and South Korea, which are still technically at war. It’s located just an hour’s drive from the South Korean capital, Seoul, and is littered with land-mines and surrounded by artillery. WATCH: The U.N. Command has released video of a North Korean soldier’s dash across the DMZ in an effort to defect to the South, while under fire by his fellow countrymen. WARNING: Video contains graphic images. Discretion is advised. Last November, a North Korean soldier made a run for the South, fleeing across the DMZ under a hail of bullets. CCTV footage released by the UNC showed the defector being shot multiple times by North Korean soldiers. Incredibly, he was pulled to safety by South Korean soldiers and survived. “We’ve still got bullet holes in our buildings,” Watt said. “We take the threat realistically. This is an enemy that has demonstrated its willingness to use violence.” Related North Korean military shoots and wounds fellow soldier trying to defect to South READ MORE: North Korean military shoots and wounds fellow soldier trying to defect to South Watt said most people aren’t aware that Canadians are on the front lines of the frozen conflict. He’s one of four Canadian officers with the UNC based in South Korea. “A lot of Canadians are aware that we played a big role in the Korean War itself,” Watt said. “But we’ve had people here ever since.” The DMZ contains a meeting point called the Joint Security Area (JSA), where previous negotiations between the North and South have taken place inside the ironically-named ’Temporary’ blue buildings, which are now a permanent fixture. While the Korean conflict is deadly serious, some of the exchanges at the JSA have become almost comical. North Korean soldiers often peer through the building’s windows at the South Koreans inside, observing and studying one another like alien life forms. There is a joint phone line (nicknamed the “Bat Phone”), but Watt says the North rarely answer. Instead, when Watt’s team needs to relay a message to their northern neighbours, he’s come up with an unorthodox method of communication. WATCH: Meet the Canadian commanding one of the world’s most dangerous borders “We’ll come down with a megaphone,” he explained. “One of the translators will read the message to the North Koreans in both English and Korean. The North Koreans will send two soldiers down with a video camera and stand there videotaping it. It’s awkward, it’s certainly not the way we’d like to do things, but it is a roundabout way of doing communication.” And it’s been known to work. “North Korea will sometimes respond to us by putting a message in a newspaper,” Watt said. Their communication is typically operational in nature; If there’s a fire in the DMZ, for example, South Koreans need to be able to extinguish the flames without getting shot and risk reigniting the war. Last June, Watt made history by becoming the first officer to meet his North Korean counterpart face-to-face since 2013. “I’m actually the only UNC officer who has stepped into a room with the North Korean army, at all,” he said. Watt says North Korea’s participation in the Olympics has had a calming effect on the DMZ. But there’s speculation that once the Games are over, the United States may launch a so-called ‘bloody nose’ strike. If that happens, Watt says, “We would almost right away be on the phone and outside (at the JSA), asking for talks with the North Korean military. That is the way that we’re going to keep things from escalating.” ||||| North Korea has changed its tune -- at least along the DMZ, or Korean Demilitarized Zone, a two-and-a-half-mile-wide buffer of landmines and booby traps that separates it from South Korea. Interested in North Korea? Add North Korea as an interest to stay up to date on the latest North Korea news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest For years, giant speakers at North Korea's propaganda village, Kijong-dong, would blast a looping playlist of martial speeches. But since the Winter Olympics began earlier this month in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the speeches, which some American officers say they can recite nearly word for word, have given way to pleasant choral and folk music, according to United Nations Command officials. \\"Instead of a lot of the hard-line speeches, it has gotten softer,\\" Lt. Cmdr. Daniel McShane, a United Nations Command duty officer who has been posted at the DMZ for five years, told ABC News during a visit to the site Wednesday. \\"We've been hearing a lot more music, and a lot of it has been more classical, especially at night.\\" The new playlist may point to a wider thaw in the 65-year-old cold war that has dominated the Korean Peninsula since the communist North invaded the South in June 1950. Relations also appeared to warm when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un dispatched his sister and the president of the country's puppet parliament to represent him at the Olympics. North Korea also sent a cheerleading team and a marching band, and the nation's athletes marched under a unified flag with the South Koreans. McShane said North Korea's different musical offerings near the border \\"could be just because there's a good number of North Korean citizens here.\\" \\"Or,\\" McShane added, \\"it could just be a coincidence. Maybe they've run out of speeches.\\" Not much else has changed near the DMZ. Although diplomats from both the North and South recently met at the so-called Peace House, tensions remain, McShane said. Communicating with North Korea remains challenging. In 2013, representatives of North Korea stopped answering a hotline phone that had connected them to the U.S.-led United Nations command. When messages must be sent, especially complaints about armistice violations, an American officer will descend from a command post, walk between the iconic blue huts, around the sunglasses-wearing South Korean guards, and signal for a translator who, from the very edge of South Korea, must literally yell into North Korea. It often takes multiple attempts. Eventually, a North Korean officer will descend, carrying a video camera to record the U.S. officer's request. That video, according to officers on the South Korean side, is then relayed to central command in Pyongyang. Often, the North Korean officer will not even respond directly to the American who's making the request. Nearby, to the north, an estimated 15,000 artillery pieces are pointed directly at Seoul, about 25 miles to the south. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a special area between North and South Korea where no one is allowed to fight or live.

How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the task of tracing a dragonfly wing stencil onto a metal surface, you need to follow a series of steps with the right tools, materials, and technique. Below is a detailed and long answer on how to execute this goal: Materials and Tools: 1. Metal sheet (size and thickness as per your requirement) 2. Dragonfly wing stencil (ready-made stencil or a printed design on paper) 3. Graphite/Carbon paper (for transferring the stencil) 4. Masking tape 5. Metal scriber/needle tool (for tracing) 6. Ball-peen hammer (optional, for embossing) 7. Flathead screwdriver (optional, for enhancing texture) 8. Metal file (for deburring edges) 9. Safety gloves and goggles 10. Permanent marker 11. Scissors (optional, for cutting stencil) 12. Clear coat spray (optional, for preserving the traced design) 13. Metal cutting tool (like tin snips, a hand shear, or a metal cutting saw) Procedure: Step 1: Prepare the Metal Sheet Choose a metal sheet with the right thickness and size for your project. Keep in mind that thinner sheets are easier to work with compared to thicker ones. Clean the metal sheet surface with a cloth and degreaser to remove any dirt, grease, or oil. Step 2: Prepare the Dragonfly Wing Stencil Select a ready-made dragonfly wing stencil or find a design online that you can print on paper. If needed, cut out the design using scissors or a precision knife to use as a stencil. Ensure that the stencil is of the desired size and shape for your metal sheet. Step 3: Attach the Stencil Lay the graphite or carbon paper on the metal surface and place the dragonfly wing stencil over the graphite or carbon paper. Make sure the desired position of the wing design on the metal sheet is achieved. Use masking tape to secure both the stencil and the carbon/graphite paper onto the metal surface to prevent them from moving while tracing. Step 4: Trace the Design onto the Metal Put on your safety gloves and goggles. Use a metal scriber or a needle tool to trace over the dragonfly wing stencil, applying enough pressure so the design is transferred onto the metal sheet through the carbon/graphite paper. Ensure that you follow the design closely and trace all the details for a crisp design transfer. Step 5: Remove the Stencil and Examine the Transfer Once the tracing is complete, carefully remove the masking tape and lift both the stencil and carbon/graphite paper. You should now have a clear outline of the dragonfly wing design on the metal sheet. Step 6 (Optional): Emboss the Lines and Enhance Texture For a more professional look, you can emboss the traced lines using a ball-peen hammer or flathead screwdriver. This process involves lightly tapping along the traced lines with the hammer or the back-end of the screwdriver to create an indentation and enhance the texture. Step 7: Inspect and Clean Up Check the transferred design for any inconsistencies or breaks in the lines. Use a permanent marker to fix any minor errors. If there are any burrs or sharp points on the metal edges, use a metal file to remove such imperfections. Step 8 (Optional): Apply Clear Coat To preserve the traced design, you can apply a clear coat spray to the metal sheet. This will help protect the design from scratches, corrosion, and fading. Step 9: Cutting and Final Touches If you want to cut the metal sheet to a specific shape, use appropriate metal cutting tools like tin snips, hand shears, or a metal-cutting saw. Be cautious while cutting the metal and always wear safety gear. Following these steps will help you accomplish the goal of tracing a dragonfly wing stencil onto a metal surface. Depending on your subsequent use or application, you may need to refine, paint, or polish the metal piece for the desired finished look."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person whose dark-haired lover is the singer Floria Tosca? is inside the article: Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa).

The statement says that most of Grameen Bank's borrowers use the small loans to start businesses by buying a cow, among other examples. This indicates that borrowers of the bank have indeed used loans to buy a cow, as it is mentioned as one of the ways to start businesses with the borrowed funds. The Grameen Bank, as a microfinance institution, provides small loans to borrowers who usually lack traditional forms of collateral. These loans are primarily employed by entrepreneurs from low-income households to establish income-generating activities, such as investing in cattle for milk production or purchasing other assets and materials to support their enterprises. In the example given, buying a cow to produce milk is explicitly listed as one of the ways borrowers utilize their loans. This suggests that there is evidence of borrowers using loans to purchase cows. Therefore, it would be incorrect to infer that none of the borrowers have ever used a loan to buy a cow, as it counters the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who used a powerful amplifier in Foo Fighters songs? ? Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\". In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\". The answer is:","completion":"Grohl"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Liam, who started reading about apex predators, learned more about predators with no natural predators. Apex predators are at the top of their food chain and have no natural predators preying on them. They play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem by controlling the population of other species. Examples of apex predators include lions, sharks, and eagles. In contrast, Fox read about grazers and large herbivores, which are primary consumers in the food chain.

(CNN) -- A federal court jury in Florida convicted seven people of participating in a global child pornography trafficking enterprise, according to the Department of Justice. Jurors convicted the seven Wednesday of multiple counts of child exploitation, pornography and obstruction of justice. Members of the organization used Internet news groups to swap and share \\"illegal images and videos depicting prepubescent children, including toddlers, engaged in various sexual and sadistic acts,\\" prosecutors said. An indictment filed in the case detailed interactions between group members as they swapped and commented on images. \\"My thanks to you and all the others that together make this the greatest group of pedos to ever gather in one place,\\" Freeman wrote in response to one posting, according to the indictment. And a posting from Castleman, cited in the indictment, read, \\"Thanks to all for the wonderful material that has been posted.\\" An Australian constable who infiltrated the group in August 2006 was among 50 witnesses testifying at trial. He told the jury that the group traded more than 400,000 images and videos of child sexual abuse before being dismantled by law enforcement, according to the Justice Department statement. Each defendant faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison, fines and the possibility of supervised release for the rest of their lives, authorities said. The seven will be sentenced April 14. During the six-day trial, evidence showed the seven participated in what prosecutors called a \\"well-organized criminal enterprise whose purpose was to proliferate child sex abuse images to its membership during a two-year period.\\" \\"This was a wide-scale, high-volume, international trafficking enterprise that used sophisticated computer encryption technology and file-sharing techniques,\\" Matthew Friedrich, acting assistant attorney general, said in the statement.

So when you put them together, (-27 + 31) balloons, you get 4 balloons (because 31 - 27 = 4). So now our equation looks like this: 4*y = -24. Next, we have to find out how many times 4 goes into -24 (or the number of \\"groups\\" of 4 in -24). When you divide -24 by 4, you get -6. So, y = -6.

Answer the following question: This article: Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

Options: - happiness - ardor - deafness - feeling better - enlightenment Explain why a human would choose \\"ardor\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"ardor\\" to answer the question above because it best captures the emotional connection and intensity that James experiences when he listens to rock music. Let's examine each of the options and understand why \\"ardor\\" is the most appropriate choice in this context. 1. Happiness: While listening to music, especially rock music, can certainly bring a sense of happiness or joy to the listener, this option is too broad and may not fully encompass the emotional depth stirred by rock music in James' experience. 2. Ardor: Ardor refers to intense enthusiasm, passion, or zeal. In the context of James' love for rock music, ardor accurately captures the strong emotions and passion that the genre can evoke in a listener. Rock music is often known for its powerful, emotional, and raw qualities, which aligns well with the notion of ardor. 3. Deafness: Deafness is not an emotion, but rather a physical condition. It is unrelated to the emotional experience of listening to music or the specific emotions that rock music might stir in James. 4. Feeling better: This option is too vague and does not specifically address the emotions that rock music evokes in James. Feeling better could refer to any improvement in one's emotional state or well-being, but it does not convey the intensity or uniqueness of the connection James has with rock music. 5. Enlightenment: Enlightenment is typically associated with a greater understanding, wisdom, or personal growth. This option focuses more on the intellectual aspect and might relate more to genres like classical or meditative music. While James might, to some extent, experience a sense of enlightenment through rock music, this option does not directly reflect the powerful emotional response that rock music stirs in him. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"ardor\\" to answer the question because it most accurately reflects the powerful and intense emotions that rock music can evoke in a listener, such as James. Rock music's passionate and raw qualities align well with the concept of ardor, making it the most appropriate choice given the context of the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A lavish apartment at the Candy & Candy development One Hyde Park has come up for sale - one of only a handful of properties in the billionaire-friendly block to reach the open market - and it could be yours for a cool £65m. The five-bedroom flat, described on property finding website zoopla.co.uk as 'exceptional', has magnificent panoramic views of Hyde Park and Knightsbridge and has been fitted out to the highest specifications. Apartment C.08.1, marketed by luxury estate agents Aylesford & Co, appeared on zoopla four days ago and is already attracting a flurry of interest. In the literature, the apartment is said to stretch out across the entire floor plate of 'pavilion C', on the 8th floor, enjoying some of the city's finest views from picture windows running the length of the property. Panoramic: The spacious living areas have views across Hyde Park on one side and across Knightsbridge and beyond on the other. Opulent: The luxury sitting room has been created by the Candy & Candy interior design team. In addition to the five bedrooms, there are six bathrooms and three extensive reception areas. 'The interior design of Apartment C.08.1 responds both to its unique size of over 9,000 sq ft as well as its extraordinary location,' the description reads. It goes on to detail how the apartment is divided into two wings, with five bedrooms found in the city wing, and all living and entertaining spaces found in the park wing. An 'impressive' 65m hallway stretches from the park side to the city side, connecting both wings and forming the so-called 'spine' of the apartment. The apartment was decorated by the Candy & Candy interior design team and is said to have taken inspiration from 'the two diverse perspectives of London, which uniquely combine in this apartment, to provide a truly modern interpretation of sophisticated and luxurious city living.' The property has reportedly already attracted a number of interested parties from across the globe since going up on Aylesford & Co's website at the end of last week. When contacted, Aylesford & Co preferred not to comment on the sale of the property, saying only that they had received a number of inquiries. They would not be drawn on the price, nor on the apartment's potential to be sold for more or less than the asking price. Airy: The 8th floor living space has views over the treetops of London's Hyde Park. Comfort: With three reception rooms, there is no shortage of places for the eventual buyer of the apartment to entertain. They would say only that it is 'early days' for the sale of the property, and that they were expecting 'a lot of interest'. But while there will be many eager to catch a glimpse of the interior of the opulent development, industry insiders told MailOnline that there will likely be some system in place at Aylesford & Co to prevent the curious carpet-treader from gaining entry just to have a look around. Agencies who have previously represented properties at One Hyde Park agencies have requested proof that any interested party should be able to afford the purchase of the property. It is likely that Aylesford & Co will use a similar system. 'Other agencies who've marketed properties in the building have demanded financial paperwork to stop rubber-neckers getting in. There are so many people who just want to have a look but have no intention of buying, and the other residents at the development are incredibly private people, and some of the world's wealthiest,' they told us. While they refused to confirm details, Aylesford & Co agreed they would be likely to operate some sort of system to ensure that only those with the means to live in One Hyde Park would be shown around the property. The buyer will join a roll call of billionaire residents, including developer Christian Candy, who owns two properties at One Hyde Park. The property tycoon, who built the apartments with his brother Nick, owns two separate flats worth £31m and £26.2m on the 10th floor. Two other apartments were sold for a combined £136 million to Ukrainian mining tycoon Rinat Akhmetov, who is thought to be investing a further £50 million to knock the properties together and refit them. Despite being owned by some of the richest people in the world, the flats qualify for lower council tax than people living in an average Band D property because Westminster Council has one of the lowest property valuations in the country. Indeed, with many of the buyers never intending to live at the address, it was reported last year that just nine out of the 62 flats sold in. One Hyde Park - the world's most expensive residential block - had been. registered for council tax. Council records revealed last year that only four owners in the block were paying the full council tax of £755.60 a year, plus £619.64 to the Greater London Authority. A further five were reported to be paying the 50 per cent discounted. council tax owed on a second home, making a considerable saving that. will no doubt boost their already impressive wealth. But with so many of the building's residents based elsewhere, the place has earned. something of a reputation as a ghost town. Subtle decor: The interior of the flat is done in muted tones. One of the five bedrooms, with stunning views across Knightsbridge.

Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. In December 1499, King Manuel I of Portugal rewarded Vasco da Gama with the town of Sines as a hereditary fief (the town his father, Estevao, had once held as a commenda). This turned out to be a complicated affair, for Sines still belonged to the Order of Santiago. The master of the Order, Jorge de Lencastre, might have endorsed the reward - after all, da Gama was a Santiago knight, one of their own, and a close associate of Lencastre himself. But the fact that Sines was awarded by the king provoked Lencastre to refuse out of principle, lest it encourage the king to make other donations of the Order's properties. Da Gama would spend the next few years attempting to take hold of Sines, an effort that would estrange him from Lencastre and eventually prompt da Gama to abandon his beloved Order of Santiago, switching over to the rival Order of Christ in 1507. In the meantime, da Gama made do with a substantial hereditary royal pension of 300,000 reis. He was awarded the noble title of Dom (lord) in perpetuity for himself, his siblings and their descendants. On 30 January 1502, da Gama was awarded the title of Almirante dos mares de Arabia, Persia, India e de todo o Oriente (\\"Admiral of the Seas of Arabia, Persia, India and all the Orient\\") - an overwrought title reminiscent of the ornate Castilian title borne by Christopher Columbus (evidently, Manuel must have reckoned that if Castile had an 'Admiral of the Ocean Seas', then surely Portugal should have one too). Another royal letter, dated October 1501, gave da Gama the personal right to intervene and exercise a determining role on any future India-bound fleet. Around 1501, Vasco da Gama married Catarina de Ataide, daughter of Alvaro de Ataide, the alcaide-mor of Alvor (Algarve), and a prominent nobleman connected by kinship with the powerful Almeida family (Catarina was a first cousin of D. Francisco de Almeida).

Well-established pet stores are usually safe choices, although the selection of species they offer may be limited.","completion":"Step 1: Research Turtle Species and Care Before purchasing a turtle, research different turtle species to determine which one is the best fit for your lifestyle, budget, and available space. Learn about their dietary requirements, habitat needs, and growth patterns. This information will help you make an informed decision about the type of turtle to purchase and how to properly care for it. Step 2: Determine the Budget Set a budget for the initial purchase of the turtle, as well as ongoing expenses like food, habitat, and accessories. Turtles can have a long lifespan, so it's essential to consider the long-term costs of owning a turtle as a pet. Step 3: Prepare Turtle Habitat Before purchasing a turtle, prepare a suitable habitat for it in your home. This includes providing appropriate heating, lighting, and filtration for the turtle's tank, as well as substrate materials and tank furniture such as hiding spots and basking areas. This will ensure that the turtle will have a comfortable and safe environment as soon as you bring it home. Step 4: Visit Reputable Sellers As mentioned in the given advice, visit reputable pet stores or breeders with clean facilities, healthy-looking animals, and readily available documentation. This may involve doing some research online, reading reviews, and talking to other pet owners or local veterinarians for recommendations. Step 5: Select a Healthy Turtle When choosing a turtle, look for signs of good health such as clear eyes, an active demeanor, and a lack of visible injuries or signs of illness. Avoid buying a turtle that has difficulty moving or displays signs of lethargy, as it may have underlying health issues. Step 6: Acquire Necessary Documentation Ask the seller for any necessary permits or documentation, such as a health certificate or proof of captive breeding, depending on your local laws and regulations. Make sure you fully understand the legal responsibilities of owning a turtle in your area before making a purchase. Step 7: Bring the Turtle Home Once you have completed the above steps, carefully transport the turtle to its new home. Place the turtle in its prepared habitat, allowing it time to adjust to its new surroundings. It may take some time for the turtle to become comfortable and active in its new environment. Step 8: Ongoing Care and Maintenance After purchasing and bringing the turtle home, regularly monitor its health and well-being. This includes maintaining proper water quality, providing a balanced diet, and regularly cleaning the habitat.

Now let's consider if both of these statements can be true at the same time, and if it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis: Step 1: Assume the premise is true - Since we assume that the premise is true, this means Gauve indeed said something. Step 2: Evaluate the hypothesis - Given that Gauve said something (based on the assumption from step 1), we need to analyze if this conflicts with the hypothesis stating \\"Gauve was silent.\\" Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis - Based on our analysis, \\"saying something\\" is the opposite of \\"being silent.\\" Therefore, these two statements are contradicting each other.

Biden took on Paul Ryan in the one and only vice presidential debate and did what Obama had failed to do last week in his debate with Mitt Romney: Biden not only won over the audience, but got under his opponent’s skin. Text Size - + reset Joe Biden’s top 5 lines at debate VP debate 2012 post analysis on POLITICO LIVE (PHOTOS: Scenes from the VP debate) Biden smirked, sneered, and openly laughed at many of Ryan’s responses. It could have looked rude, but Biden made it look tough. After all, Biden was the 69-year-old defender and Ryan was the 42-year-old challenger. But by the end of the evening, Joltin’ Joe had done real damage to his opponent. (PHOTOS: Joe Biden’s smile) In fact, as the 90 minutes flew by - - it was the rare debate where one actually wanted it to go longer - - Ryan began looking younger and younger. And not in a good way. Both men have been in politics most of their adult lives, but Biden’s adult life has been longer. Biden was in the Senate so long, he knows a dozen ways of observing outward forms of politeness, while sticking a knife in your ribs and twisting it. (Also on POLITICO: 7 takeaways from the VP debate) “With all due respect, that is a bunch of malarkey,” Biden said to Ryan at one point. And how much respect is a bunch of malarkey due? “This is a bunch of stuff,” Biden said of Ryan’s remarks at another point, leaving no doubt what word he meant instead of stuff. “Romney said, ‘Aw, let Detroit go bankrupt,’ ” Biden said. “My friends and neighbors pay more than Gov. Romney in federal income tax! I’ve had it up to here!” Ryan tried to dodge this right jab, but walked into a left hook instead. And it was of his own making. “He talks about Detroit?” Ryan said. “Mitt Romney is a car guy!” (Also on POLITICO: Vice presidential debate transcript) Biden sat a few feet away from Ryan at the debate table and openly laughed in his face at this. And one got the impression that Paul Ryan did not like to be laughed at. But did Biden care? He did not. ||||| The one and only vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan is over -- and what a debate it was. The VP debate in two minutes: Highlights from Thursday night's debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan in Danville, Kentucky. Biden and Ryan repeatedly savaged one another over everything from Iran to the economy and back -- interrupting, smirking and laughing out loud as the other man tried to make his points. We live-tweeted every minute -- nay, every second -- of the proceedings but also took a few notes about the highs and the lows of the night. Our winners and losers are below. One person you won't find in our winners and losers is Ryan. The debate was SO dominated by Biden -- for good and for bad -- that Ryan was largely a bystander. If you liked aggressive Biden, that makes Ryan a loser. If you don't aggressive Biden, that makes Ryan a winner. Have some of your own? The comments section awaits. WINNERS * Joe Biden's last 15 minutes: Biden was measured, passionate and heartfelt when talking about abortion and why he thought he and President Obama deserved a second term. He made his points forcefully but without any or the sarcasm or the nasty edges that characterized his performance for the bulk of the debate. (More on that below.) The question for Biden (and Democrats): Were people still watching? And why didn't he flash a little more of that trademark empathy earlier? * Martha Raddatz: Moderating a rhetorical fistfight is no easy task. Raddatz did well to try to give both candidates equal time, keep them on the question asked and insert her own expertise -- particularly on foreign policy -- when it was necessary and appropriate. A job well done under remarkably adverse circumstances. * Political junkies/party bases: If you live and breathe politics, this was a debate for the ages. From the jump, Biden and Ryan were at each others' throats -- mixing it up in a way that neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney was willing to do last week. Biden's willingness to scoff at, laugh at and generally express his disregard for Ryan (and Republican policies in general) are just what the Democratic base needed/wanted after Obama's uninspiring performance last week. Ryan's unwillingness to back away from his proposals will make Republicans smile. * \\"My friend\\": Biden used that term roughly 1,000 times to refer to Ryan. The best part? It was abundantly clear from the start that Biden not only doesn't consider Ryan a friend but also that he actively dislikes the Wisconsin Congressman. * Chamillionaire: Raddatz mentioned that the DC-born rapper while telling the audience to turn their phones off pre-debate. Sure, her comment only made it on C-SPAN but that's got to be more than Chamillionaire could have expected out of tonight, right? LOSERS * Joe Biden's first 75 minutes: As we noted above, Biden's aggressive performance is a sure winner for him (and the president) within the Democratic base. But, it felt to us like he went a little bit overboard and, at times, bordered on bullying Ryan. Biden's derisive smiles and laughs while Ryan tried to answer questions weren't great optics for the vice president and his repeated interruptions won't make those who think politics should be more civil happy. Biden's agenda was clear during the debate: he was set on erasing the passive performance of Obama last week. That he did, but in so doing it felt like he went a bit overboard. * Undecided voters: If you came into this debate hoping to find a civil discussion of the differences between the two candidates, you, um, didn't get what you wanted. The bulk of the debate was Biden and Ryan slamming one another for not telling the truth, being misinformed or simply being clueless. The bickering that dominated the middle section of the debate -- ok, the whole debate -- is just the sort of stuff independents/undecideds don't like. It's easy to imagine they simply turned off the debate -- if they were watching it at all. * Non verbal communication: For as much as these candidates prep for the debates, we are consistently amazed that they don't get that how you look when you aren't talking is almost as important as what you say when you are. Biden's smile and Ryan's smirk were both unappealing. For the next presidential debate, can the two candidates simply perfect the \\"I am looking at you with the flattest expression ever\\" face? Actually, on second thought, don't. It would rob the Fix of some of the joy that comes with watching these things. * Big Bird: Not ONE mention of the 8-foot tall yellow bird? Color us disappointed. We can only imagine how Elmo, the Count and Oscar the Grouch feel about all of this. * A-Rod: Does the guy do ANYTHING other than strike out in big moments?

Paul Ryan was earnest, youthful, and perhaps a bit over-scripted. The upshot was a vice presidential debate that was occasionally entertaining for partisans on both sides, but was mostly unenlightening. Ultimately, I suspect, it will prove inconsequential. It's hard to believe it will change any votes, or give either side momentum. The truth is the world will little note nor long remember what was said in Danville. The world will remember—certainly some of us will remember—what happened a few hours before at Nationals Park: Jayson Werth's 13-pitch at bat leading off the ninth-inning, culminating in a walk off home run that won the game and tied the Nats-Cards division series at 2-2. Right now, I see the Orioles and Yankees are tied 1-1 going into the 11th inning. Back to the playoffs! UPDATE: Orioles win 2-1 in 13 innings! The deciding games in the Nats-Cards and O's-Yanks series are tomorrow night. All four division series will have gone five games—the baseball postseason is off to a close and tense start, to accompany a close and tense election season. The desirable outcome: The Nats over the Orioles in the World Series in an exciting victory for our nation's capital, and Romney-Ryan over Obama-Biden in an exciting victory for our nation. ||||| Please consider disabling it for our site, or supporting our work in one of these ways A spirited debate between the vice president and his would-be successor puts the top of both tickets to shame. Reuters Joe Biden's debate performance easily cleared the low bar set by his boss: He was aggressive, attentive and in many ways effective pushing President Obama's agenda. But he was also sarcastic and condescending - a stylistic blemish against workmanlike rival Paul Ryan. It is impossible to predict how voters will view Biden's frequent interruptions, his tense smiles, and his derisive laughter. Did they consider the behavior rude or a reflection of Ryan's naiveté? MORE FROM NATIONAL JOURNAL MORE FROM NATIONAL JOURNAL Fact-Checking the Debate The VP Debate Transcript Photos: Behind the Scenes But, clearly, viewers and voters were treated to a free-wheeling and substantial debate over the size of government, the limits of U.S. military power and other issues defining the choice between Obama and Mitt Romney. In style and substance, Biden v. Ryan outshined Obama v. Romney. The debate is unlikely to play a significant role in the outcome of the Nov. 6 election. Partisans walked away from the debate happy with their guys' performance, and undecided voters will focus more intently on the top of the ticket. \\"Biden won the passion card. Ryan the wonk card,\\" said Democratic strategist Chris Kofinis. \\"More or less a draw.\\" But, boy, what a show. Moderator Martha Raddatz opened with a simple question: Did an intelligence failure lead to the attacks on the U.S. embassy in Libya? Biden ducked the question and launched into a long-winded defense of Obama's foreign policies, making sure to mention the assassination of Osama bin Laden. Ryan answered Raddatz directly and methodically. He noted that it took the administration two weeks to acknowledge that terrorists attacked the embassy, after blaming an anti-Muslim video. He said the administration failed to secure the embassy. And he said Libya is indicative of a broader problem. \\"What we're watching is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy, which is making things more chaotic and us less safe,\\" Ryan said. Unlike Obama, who failed to respond to Romney's best punched a week ago, Biden responded in kind. He said Ryan's party voted against increased security for U.S. embassies and that Romney's first public response to the embassy attack was knee-jerk. \\"Usually, when there is a crisis, we pull together,\\" Biden said, calling Romney an opportunist. \\"That's not presidential leadership.\\" Call it a draw. Biden was at his best demonizing Republican policies on the middle-class. Democrats chagrined over Obama's sleepy performance surely were cheered as Biden cited the auto industry rescue and efforts by the Obama administration to help underwater homeowners, calling out Romney's opposition to those policies. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In the vice presidential debate, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan faced off, discussing topics such as Iran, the economy, and abortion. Biden's performance was aggressive, engaging, and passionate, while Ryan was viewed as earnest and somewhat scripted. The debate was considered to be more engaging and substantial than the first presidential debate between Obama and Romney.

At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired.

But that didn't stop a wave of spring rush hopefuls from attending the newly-reinstated University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi's open-house event on Thursday, according to reports. During the event, the group's centrally-located house was apparently 'crowded and lively', with hordes of undergraduates hoping to impress the fraternity's members and leaders. One UVA freshman, who attended the open house but wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I can definitely affirm it was crowded and lively. It was the last house I hit and I still had to wait in line.' Controversy: A wave of spring rush hopefuls attended the newly-reinstated University of Virginia fraternity Phi Kappa Psi's open-house event on Thursday, according to reports. Above, protesters are pictured outside the fraternity after it appeared at the center of a controversial Rolling Stone article about a brutal gang rape. Meanwhile, a female freshman said that as she walked through campus during the spring sorority rush on Thursday, it appeared that Phi Psi's house 'was the busiest frat I saw that night'. In an email to New York magazine on Friday, fraternity president, Stephen Scipione, confirmed: 'We had a good crowd last night'. But he added: 'It’s far too early to judge rush this year.' On Monday, police announced that they had been unable to confirm that an alleged gang rape occurred at Phi Psi's house, as described in the controversial Rolling Stone article. The story detailed the graphic claims of an unnamed UVA junior who said she was gang-raped by seven men in an apparent initiation ritual at the fraternity in 2012. Brothers: On Friday, Phi Psi president, Stephen Scipione (left), confirmed: 'We had a good crowd last night'. Right, fraternity member, David Fontenot, 22, said the group 'knew the Rolling Stone story was not true' But in an email to the Associated Press, Charlottesville Police Captain Gary Pleasants said: 'The statement reads that we did not find any substantive basis to confirm the allegations occurred at Phi Kappa Psi, not that we said the assault did not occur. We are still investigating.' Following Monday's verdict, the school declared it had reinstated the group and its activities after consulting with the police force about the findings of their investigation. Speaking about Thursday's open-house event, Matt, a freshman who did not rush Phi Psi, said he thought it would have been unfair if the house had been 'deserted' due to the allegations. Anonymous: Since the article's publication, the UVA junior (pictured) who accused the fraternity of gang rape has seen her allegations widely discredited. 'I personally didn’t avoid it because of that. There could have been people that would have because of that, but if they could vocalize that, it’d be an unpopular opinion,' he said. He added that his friend, who had rushed the fraternity, had told him the place was 'packed'. After the Rolling Stone article was published in November, the magazine issued a statement noting discrepancies in the story and apologizing to those involved in the fraternity. Despite its apology, campus and fraternity leaders were put under pressure to adopt reforms as protesters gathered outside Phi Psi's house, with many calling for the end of all Greek Life. The building was gratified with statements like 'UVA Center for Rape Studies' and 'Suspend Us!'. Fearing for their safety, most fraternity members fled the house, booking hotel rooms. Meanwhile, police launched an investigation into the alleged assault at the request of the university. 'We knew that the Rolling Stone story was not true,' said 22-year-old fraternity member David Fontenot, a senior from McLean, Virginia, recalling the aftermath of the article's publication. On Monday, Cpt Pleasants said that although university officials were not presented a written report on the police investigation into Phi Psi, they were updated via a telephone call. 'We just didn't find any reasons to keep sanctions on that particular fraternity right now,' he told the AP in a telephone interview. While the school temporarily suspended fraternities' and sororities' social activities, administrators vowed to take an extensive look at improving safety on campus. Central location: On Monday, Charlottesville Police announced that they had been unable to confirm that an alleged gang rape occurred at Phi Psi's house (pictured). However, an investigation is said to be ongoing. Phi Psi was the first fraternity to agree to new rules, some of which address alcohol distribution at parties. Officials want to make it less likely for drugs to be slipped into drinks. 'We believe that in the midst of this ordeal, there is an opportunity to move forward with important safety improvements,' Mr Scipione, a 21-year-old junior from Richmond, said last week. 'This has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in this problem. It's opened all of our eyes to the problem of sexual assault. 'Now it's time to do something about it. As a fraternity, we are going to continue discussing that need in the coming weeks.' Other fraternities had a Friday deadline to sign new agreements with the university that were developed by the school's Inter-Fraternity Council in a bid to keep students at parties safer. Among them: Kegs of beer and pre-made mixes of liquor and punch will be banned; beer must be served in closed cans, and food and water must be made available. The female freshman who walked past Phi Psi's fraternity house on Thursday night said the absence of strong pre-mixed drinks will likely make parties less popular for young female students. Because of this, 'I think there’s going to be more pregaming,' she told New York magazine.

While it is not uncommon for altercations to take place in such establishments, the participants usually aren't high-ranking homicide detectives. This time, however, Whiteley was both the protagonist and the antagonist, resulting in an unexpected turn of events for all parties involved. Whiteley, a respected member of the force, had just concluded a long day on the job when he decided to visit a nearby pub in Whitby to unwind. Unbeknownst to him, this quick bite to eat would ultimately lead to a seven-hour bender and set the stage for the events that would unfold. One would think that as a seasoned homicide detective, Whiteley would be accustomed to maintaining a low profile. Nevertheless, on this particular occasion, he was anything but discreet. As pub patrons looked on, Whiteley consumed alcohol excessively, eventually leaving himself and his partner with little ability to walk or even stand on their own two feet. As the intoxicated duo exited the pub, they were spotted by 41-year-old holidaymaker Carl Sarsfield, who couldn't help but notice their obvious impairment. Witnessing their unsteady gait and slurred speech, Sarsfield made the not-so-subtle comment that Whiteley and his partner were too \\"legless\\" to drive. Unbeknownst to him, his concern for their safety would lead to his own undoing. Enraged by this seemingly harmless remark, Whiteley abruptly tore off his shirt and viciously slapped Sarsfield across the face, causing injury and immense emotional distress to the unwitting bystander. The shocking unprovoked assault was witnessed by several other pub patrons, who quickly contacted law enforcement to report the incident. In a disheartening turn of events, Det Sgt Paul Whiteley was soon found guilty of the assault. This decorated homicide detective, who had dedicated his life to fighting crime and seeking justice for others, now found himself on the wrong side of the law. In response to the conviction, Whiteley was fined almost £1,500 for the attack and was subsequently sacked from his position as a detective sergeant. While the entire affair was undoubtedly a source of personal anguish and professional humiliation for Whiteley, it also serves as a stark reminder that no one is above the law and that our actions always have consequences. In conclusion, the tragic incident that unfolded in Whitby that fateful night was a clear testament to the impact of alcohol on one's behavior and decision-making abilities. Even a seasoned detective like Whiteley was not immune to the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption. This chain of events should serve as a reminder to us all: one's status as a law enforcement officer does not render one impervious to the ramifications of poor choices, and every individual must be held accountable for their actions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Putting on weight was the expected outcome for Matthew but not Nelson because","completion":"Putting on weight was the expected outcome for Matthew but not Nelson because their body types, metabolisms, and lifestyles led to different consequences despite following the same diet and exercise plan. First, the difference in their body types could be a reason why Matthew gained weight while Nelson maintained his original size. Body types, scientifically known as somatotypes, can determine how an individual metabolizes food and retains muscle mass. There are three primary body types: ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph. Matthew could possess an endomorphic body type, which is characterized by a slow metabolism and a higher propensity to store body fat. His body may retain more calories as fat, leading to weight gain when consuming the same diet as someone with a different body type, such as Nelson. On the other hand, Nelson might be an ectomorph, characterized by a fast metabolism and a body that naturally struggles to put on weight. He may burn calories more efficiently, making it difficult for him to gain weight, even when following the same plan as Matthew. Secondly, the difference in their basal metabolic rates (BMR) can also play a vital role in weight gain. BMR is the number of calories required for essential bodily functions when at rest. Factors like age, gender, height, and weight heavily influence BMR. As a result, two individuals with the same body type can still have different BMRs because of these factors. If Matthew has a slower BMR than Nelson, despite appearing similar in physique, his body would burn fewer calories even when not participating in physical activities. This variation puts Matthew at a higher risk for weight gain when compared to Nelson. Additionally, besides body type and BMR, lifestyle factors come into play. Daily habits play a significant role in determining weight fluctuations. Chronic stress, sleep deprivation, or even medication can cause hormonal imbalances that lead to weight gain. Matthew may have external influences which make it difficult for him to lose weight or maintain a healthy physique as effortlessly as Nelson can. Furthermore, Matthew and Nelson might have individual genetic factors that predispose them differently to weight gain. Genetics can affect fat distribution, appetite regulation, and even how the body responds to different types of food. So, despite similar eating and exercise habits, Matthew's genetic susceptibility to weight gain may have led to the expected outcome of him putting on weight. Lastly, the exercise regimen both individuals follow might also be unsuitable for Matthew's body and fitness goals. Nelson, who manages to stay slim, might have a better natural ability to gain and maintain muscle mass, and the employed exercise plan could be perfectly suitable for his body and goals. In contrast, Matthew might need a specialized exercise program focusing on his specific needs, taking into consideration his body type, metabolism, and lifestyle to prevent weight gain. In summary, numerous factors such as body types, metabolism, lifestyles, genetics, and exercise selection led to Matthew putting on weight while Nelson maintained his slim figure. It's crucial to understand that every individual's body is unique, and what works for one person may not necessarily be the optimal solution for another. Therefore, it's essential to tailor diet plans, exercise regimens, and lifestyle habits to each individual's needs to achieve and maintain a healthy weight."},{"prompt":"pick from the following. -- sleep through their alarm -- apologize for being late -- ignore his boss Jesse was getting late to work last week.

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Paragraph: Two neighboring ponds were stocked with adult fish last year.

He begins a relationship with his first love Hetty Kelly, the night before he is due to leave for America he proposes to her but she declines reasoning she is too young. Chaplin promises to return to England for her when he is a success. Chaplin is sent to America by Karno and is given a job by Mack Sennett, the most famous comedy producer in Hollywood. While there, he creates his iconic Tramp persona and due to the terrible directorial capabilities of Sennett's wife Mabel, Chaplin is allowed to direct his own movies. Before the year is over, Chaplin directs over 20 movies and after Sydney joins him in America to become his manager, decides to break away from Sennett to have complete creative control over his films and with the goal of one day owning his own studio. In 1917, Chaplin completes work on The Immigrant which causes some concern over the film's political subject matter and starts a brief romance with actress Edna Purviance. Years later at an industry party thrown by Douglas Fairbanks, Chaplin meets and begins dating child actress Mildred Harris. Chaplin eventually becomes wealthy and profitable enough to set up his own studio and becomes \\"the most famous man in the world\\" all before his thirtieth birthday. Chaplin...

The Conservatives would give English state schools the freedom to choose to have longer teaching hours and extra classes at the weekend; he told the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' annual conference. Gove said the move would help to close the achievement gap with richer children whose parents could afford extras such as tutoring and music lessons. He told delegates in Manchester, \\"For children who come from homes where parents don't have the resources to provide _ and cultural experiences, there are benefits in having those children in the learning environment, in school, for longer.\\" \\"Parents would love to have schools starting earlier in some circumstances, and certainly going on later in the afternoon, given the reality of their working lives,\\" he said. He held up the example of Kipp (Knowledge Is Power Program) schools in the US, which are often based in the poorest communities and open from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays, plus Saturdays. But it would be up to schools to decide to offer longer hours, Gove added. Parents said Saturday classes could become a \\"badge of dishonor\\" if pupils were forced to go while teachers raised concerns about their workload. Margaret Morrissey, of Parents Outloud, said, \\"I think the suggestion the government made about one-to-one teaching for these kids would be a more preferable way of improving these children's performance. I'm just not sure whether taking away a child at weekends is actually going to make them cleverer in the week.\\" The ATL's general secretary, Mary Bousted, said, \\"If we want Saturday schools, then we need more teachers doing the extra hours, not the same teachers working longer.\\" Answer:","completion":"Question: According to the article, what proposal did the shadow schools secretary, Michael Gove, make to help close the achievement gap between poorer and richer children in English state schools?

In which case the number of mesopredators would decrease, case A or case B? John was studying the species in Siberia. He found that the Siberian tiger is an apex predator. It had a pretty stable population during the sixteenth century. He noted that information as case A. Then with the introduction of guns the number of Siberian tigers decreased in the seventeenth century. He noted that information as case B. Hint: Apex predators can have profound effects on ecosystems, as the consequences of both controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators, and may be capable of self-regulation. They are central to the functioning of ecosystems, the regulation of disease, and the maintenance of biodiversity. When introduced to subarctic islands, for example, Arctic foxes' predation of seabirds has been shown to turn grassland into tundra. Such wide-ranging effects on lower levels of an ecosystem are termed trophic cascades. The removal of top-level predators, often through human agency, can cause or disrupt trophic cascades. For example, reduction in the population of sperm whales, apex predators with a fractional trophic level of 4.7, by hunting has caused an increase in the population of large squid, trophic level over 4 (carnivores that eat other carnivores). This effect, called mesopredator release, occurs in terrestrial and marine ecosystems; for instance, in North America, the ranges of all apex carnivores have contracted whereas those of 60% of mesopredators have grown in the past two centuries. A:","completion":"The number of mesopredators would decrease in case A. In case A, the Siberian tiger, an apex predator, had a stable population during the sixteenth century. Since apex predators play a critical role in controlling prey density and restricting smaller predators (mesopredators), a stable population of apex predators would contribute to controlling the number of mesopredators. In case B, the number of Siberian tigers decreased due to the introduction of guns in the seventeenth century. This reduction in the population of apex predators would lead to the mesopredator release effect, resulting in an increase in the population of mesopredators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well.

Read this and answer the question Society throughout Europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the Black Death. Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned, as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas. Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe, as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free. Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents. The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period. Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders, and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments.

Asia Argento 17-Year-Old Jimmy Bennett Sexually Assaulted Me Asia Argento Says 17-Year-Old Jimmy Bennett Sexually Assaulted Her Breaking News Asia Argento says Jimmy Bennett -- who had sex with her when he was 17 years old -- is lucky she didn't file charges that HE sexually assaulted and then extorted her. Argento's lawyer, Mark Jay Heller, tells TMZ, his client's text messages that TMZ posted tell the real story about what went down at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Marina del Rey, CA. The text in question read, \\"The horny kid jumped me ... I had sex with him it felt weird.\\" She goes on to say she was \\"frozen\\" when he was on top of her. Heller says, \\"Asia chose at the time not to prosecute Bennett for sexually attacking her.\\" As for her statement after the story broke -- \\"I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett\\" -- Heller says she was being honest because it was a one-time only encounter and not a relationship. Heller goes on to claim Bennett smelled a payday and tried to extort Argento, especially when he found out she was dating Anthony Bourdain. He says Bennett \\"chose to intrude on that relationship and demand financial payment from Bourdain in consideration for not embarrassing Asia and indirectly Bourdain ...\\" Heller says Anthony chose to protect Asia by agreeing to pay 380k even though she did nothing wrong. And, Heller says, Bourdain paid 250k up to this point, but Argento will not pay the balance. Heller ends by attacking Bennett, saying, \\"Asia does not intend to prosecute Bennett for his conduct and recognizes that his unfortunate past, his stalled acting career, and a lawsuit against his own parents for allegedly misappropriating more than a million and a half dollars from his account might explain his desperation to seek money from Asia and Bourdain for this falsely alleged incident that took place more than 5 years ago.\\" The attack against Bennett is odd ... because Argento has spoken out against shaming alleged victims in sexual assault cases. Bennett claims he was indeed sexually assaulted by Argento. ||||| Rose McGowan has opened up about being “betrayed” by fellow MeToo movement campaigner Asia Argento and referred to Harvey Weinstein as the “cult leader” of Hollywood. McGowan was in London doing the rounds of breakfast television series including Piers Morgan-fronted Good Morning Britain and Channel 5’s Jeremy Vine show ahead of picking up the GQ Men of the Year Inspiration Award, becoming the first woman to receive the honor. The Brave author said that she believed Argento was “lying” to her with regards to the actress’ relationship with Jimmy Bennett, the 17 year old she slept with when she was 37. Speaking on GMB, McGowan said that “if we’re going to look for beauty in this really horrible situation” it shows that “boys have voices too”. She said that it was a “horrible situation” but that her own feelings are “very insignificant” and she expected there to be “due process”. “MeToo is not just for women, I’ve had so many men share their stories of abuse, it’s never happened before in history and people are freaking out and trying to analyse and crunch the data, my response is to let it breathe, let people have their voice. If I feel like walking down the street naked, no one has the right to rape me. When I take my girlfriend, who is masculine presenting, to a gay club, often times she gets grabbed. Everybody has the sovereign right to their body,” she added. The Scream star fought back against Morgan’s claim that some careers have been hit by false accusations. “I don’t know if we know if careers are over because it’s been such a short period of time…The hell you go through just to speak truth really whittles down the false accusations. You can cut off the rot and let the good people come up. All we need to do is to have a collective conversation.” She also admitted fearing for her health in the long-term, particularly as a result of the stress levels and called the last two years “mindbending”. Later in the morning, McGowan went on Jeremy Vine’s new Channel 5 discussion show to talk about similar topics. She said that a lot of people who have been hurt by sexual harassment “don’t understand that they are not to blame” and remarked that Harvey Weinstein was the “cult leader” of Hollywood. But she added, “I was never really in love with Hollywood, for me it was my day job, I’m an artist in full and always been a writer and now a filmmaker and a producer and singing on an album that I’ve been creating for the past three years, while for the past four years pushing against Hollywood and societal constructs and pushing back at the rules we’re all meant to follow. What are they going to do, put me in time out celebrity jail? It’s absurd.” ||||| Asia Argento In Bed with 17-Year-Old Boy ... In Sexual Encounter Asia Argento and 17-Year-Old Boy in Bed in Sexual Encounter EXCLUSIVE Asia Argento says she did not have sex with then 17-year-old Jimmy Bennett, but a photo and various text messages between Argento and a friend tell a very different story ... she flat-out says she had sex with him. This is one of 4 photos Bennett, now 22, took in a Marina del Rey hotel room back in 2013. The then 37-year-old Argento and Bennett are on a bed shirtless, their heads on a pillow and their arms entangled. Sources tell TMZ the pic was taken after the 2 had intercourse. It's a crime in California for an adult to have sex with a person under 18. Bennett later threatened legal action and, in April, Argento settled with him for 380,000 ... which her boyfriend, Anthony Bourdain, paid. Argento released a statement Tuesday, saying, \\"I have never had any sexual relationship with Bennett.\\" Above are partial text exchanges between Argento and one of her friends. Argento and the friend went back and forth in the midst of the backlash from the New York Times story that ran Sunday about her and Bennett.

The paper claimed that Argento had quietly arranged to pay Bennett 380,000 in the months that followed her accusations against Weinstein. Initially, Argento publicly rejected Bennett's accusations. However, leaked text messages between Argento and a friend, as well as a photo showing both Bennett and Argento in bed, suggest otherwise. According to the texts, Argento said she had sexual intercourse with Bennett, stating, \\"The horny kid jumped me... I had sex with him it felt weird.\\" She said she had been \\"frozen\\" when Bennett was on top of her. Argento's lawyer Mark Jay Heller, maintained her innocence, claiming Argento decided not to prosecute Bennett for sexually assaulting her. He added that a part of 380,000 had already been paid by the late Anthony Bourdain, Argento's boyfriend at the time. Moreover, Heller claimed that Bennett tried to extort Argento for a financial payout after discovering she was dating Bourdain, to avoid potentially embarrassing them. Despite paying the initial sum, Argento decided not to complete the payment, and Heller suggested Bennett's actions may be driven by his unsuccessful career, family issues, and financial desperation. Actress Rose McGowan, another vocal supporter of #MeToo and friend of Argento, claimed to be \\"betrayed\\" by Argento's misrepresentation of the situation with Bennett. She hoped that despite the unfortunate situation, it would highlight that the #MeToo movement is also for male victims of abuse. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department considered initiating a criminal investigation into Bennett's claims. While in light of this incident, Weinstein's attorney called Argento's credibility into question, given her vocal role in the #MeToo movement and accusations against Weinstein."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Contact: Brian Frederick The ALS Association 202-465-8800 bfrederick@alsa-national.org FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE The ALS Association Triples Spending on Research Thanks to Ice Bucket Donations Board of Trustees Approves Integrated, Collaborative Approach Washington, D.C. (October 31, 2014) – The ALS Association announced on Thursday that the Board of Trustees has met and developed a long-term strategy for leveraging the Ice Bucket Challenge donations it has received to advance its integrated mission of leading the fight to treat and cure ALS through global research, care services and public policy. This will result in The Association tripling the amount of money it spends on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research to ensure the most promising research continues to be funded. It will also result in greater support to The Association’s Certified Treatment Centers of Excellence, which provide evidence-based, multi-disciplinary ALS care and services in a supportive atmosphere with an emphasis on hope and quality of life. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s Disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects neurons (nerve cells) in the brain and the spinal cord. Eventually, people with ALS lose the ability to initiate and control muscle movement, which often leads to total paralysis and death within two to five years of diagnosis. There is no cure and no life-prolonging treatments for the disease. “We are thrilled with the additional funding for research and care services that the Ice Bucket Challenge has provided, even more important is the chance the entire ALS community now has to leverage our good fortune to work together toward our common goal of defeating this horrific disease,” said Bill Thoet, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of The ALS Association. “Together, we now have the unique opportunity to fundamentally change the nature of this fight.” The Association’s Board of Trustees, staff, chapter representatives and advisers met in Denver on October 17-18 to review and incorporate the feedback they had received from key stakeholders, including people living with ALS and their families, over the last two months. “Thanks to the Ice Bucket Challenge, we are able to continue to improve the most comprehensive pipeline for ALS treatments in the world,” said Barbara Newhouse, President and CEO of The ALS Association. “We now have tremendous momentum in the search for a cure. Our integrated mission, combined with increased collaboration, is accelerating our ability to move potential treatments through the drug development process and improve the support for people living with ALS at our care centers.” The Certified Treatment Centers of Excellence provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary team approach to care that has been proven to both extend and improve the quality of life for those living with ALS. In addition, the Centers actively participate in ALS-related research. Earlier this month, The ALS Association announced it was supporting six different programs and initiatives designed to expedite the search for treatments and a cure for ALS. Four of these projects involve global research cooperative alliances that would not have moved forward without the funding from The ALS Association and the matching donations it received. In addition, the Association launched a new collaborative initiative that will bring the ALS community together to establish an ALS drug development guidance document. No such document exists today, which creates uncertainty and risk for what already is a difficult, lengthy and costly process. This initiative will incentivize ALS drug development, reduce obstacles and provide new opportunities to accelerate research and bring new treatments from the bench to the bedside. About The ALS Association The ALS Association is the only national non-profit organization fighting Lou Gehrig’s Disease on every front. By leading the way in global research, providing assistance for people with ALS through a nationwide network of chapters, coordinating multidisciplinary care through certified clinical care centers, and fostering government partnerships, The Association builds hope and enhances quality of life while aggressively searching for new treatments and a cure.

(October 2, 2014)—After the generous outpouring of support from people all around the globe due to this summer’s Ice Bucket Challenge, the Board of Trustees of The ALS Association has approved an initial expenditure of 21.7 million in funding to support six programs and initiatives to expedite the search for treatments and a cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Additionally, 12.5 million in matching donations bring the total commitment to 34.2 million. Four of these projects involve global research cooperative alliances that would not have moved forward without this significant funding from The Association, made possible through the generosity of donors worldwide, along with matching gifts. “We recognize the sense of urgency felt by people living with the disease and their families and I want to assure everyone that our number one commitment is to making decisions that get treatments to patients in the fastest way possible,” said Barbara Newhouse, President and CEO of The ALS Association. “Our roadmap to treatments involves collaboration with other ALS organizations and with industry, university investigators, government agencies, pharmaceutical and biotech companies and other nonprofit organizations committed to the fight against ALS.” During a 30-day period this summer, The ALS Association received more than 100 million in donations. Over the last few weeks, The Association has actively convened key stakeholder groups, including a panel of advisors made up of people living with ALS, to provide input into a comprehensive plan that The Association will release in early November after approval from the Board of Trustees. The bulk of The ALS Association’s initial 21.7 million commitment—18.5 million—will advance four new cooperative alliances for the next one to three years involving research that has been identified as critical to finding new treatments for ALS: ALS Accelerated Therapeutics (ALS ACT), The New York Genome Center, the Neuro Collaborative, and Project MinE.These projects would not have been possible without Ice Bucket Challenge donations. There will be synergies between these four initiatives that will increase the quantity, and most importantly, the value of data openly available to the ALS research community worldwide. The ALS Association will play a pivotal role in coordinating these efforts. Under the leadership of The ALS Association’s Chief Scientist, Lucie Bruijn, Ph.D., M.B.A., The Association has been involved in the planning of each of these new collaborations, and, in each case, has sought the advice and evaluation of leading researchers to assess scientific merit, to gather additional ideas for each project, and to ensure the maximum relevance to future therapies. ALS Accelerated Therapeutics (ALS ACT) ALS ACT is a novel academic-industry partnership to accelerate treatments for people living with ALS, which is able to proceed with a 10 million commitment from The ALS Association and matching gift of 10 million from The ALS Finding a Cure Foundation. The combined contributions from The ALS Association and The ALS Finding a Cure Foundation will significantly expedite therapy development. The ALS Finding a Cure Foundation is led by Peter N. Foss, Lee Rizzuto and Denis Rizzuto. The foundation was created in April of 2014 and is a tribute to Denis’ wife, Christie Rizzuto, who was diagnosed with ALS five years ago at age 41. ALS ACT will enact a multi-pronged approach to expediting clinical trials in ALS. Efforts will include (1) developing neuroimaging tools as potential biomarkers for ALS progression, a key unmet need in trials; (2) development of therapeutic approaches to decrease production of misfolded proteins within motor neurons and reverse neuroinflammation, two major contributors to the disease process; (3) a challenge grant program to overcome key roadblocks in the search for therapies; (4) support for phase IIA pilot clinical trials using biomarkers. Merit Cudkowicz, Co-Chair of the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) and Chief of Neurology and the ALS Program at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), notes that these efforts will accelerate diagnosis, speed development of new treatments for people with ALS, and remove road blocks to finding a cure for ALS. In addition, ALS ACT will strengthen ongoing collaborative efforts in support of clinical trials, including NeuroBANK, a central repository for clinical research data in ALS, and the NEALS (Northeast ALS Consortium) Biorepository. Initially established through the Translational Research Advancing Therapies for ALS (TREAT ALS™) NEALS Clinical Trials Network, NeuroBANK will host, curate, and disseminate proteomic, genomic and clinical data.

Appel, M.D., Houston Methodist Hospital System; and Clive Svendsen, Ph.D., Cedars-Sinai; Nadeem Ishaque, Ph.D., and Tom Gentile Senior Vice President General Electric. New York Genome Center (NYGC) The ALS Association and its Greater New York Chapter will match a 2.5 million gift from The Tow Foundation in support of a new project at the NYGC, which will bring together for the first time a world-class scientific team to further understand the genetic basis of ALS. Recent discoveries have indicated that genes may contribute to a much larger percentage of ALS cases than previously thought. Finding these genes and understanding how they work will allow development of new therapeutic approaches. Under the leadership of Drs. Robert Darnell and Hemali Phatnani together with their advisors, including Tom Maniatis and Marc Tessier-Lavigne , the NYGC will spearhead a cooperative and multidisciplinary effort to provide open-source “big data” to benefit the entire ALS research community. Investigators: Robert B. Darnell, M.D., Ph.D.; Hemali Phatnani, Ph.D.; Tom Maniatis, Ph.D.; Marc Tessier-Lavigne, Ph.D.; Merit Cudkowicz, M.D., MSc; Robert J. Brown, Jr. M.D., D.Phil.; Virginia Lee, Ph.D.; John Q. Trojanowski, M.D., Ph.D., Alex Sherman; James Berry, MD; Neil Shneider, M.D., Ph.D.; David Goldstein, Ph.D.; and Tom Jessell, Ph.D. Neuro Collaborative The Neuro Collaborative will combine the efforts of three world renowned California labs focused on ALS: Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, the University of California San Diego and the Gladstone Institutes, an affiliate of the University of California San Francisco, to develop and expedite therapeutic approaches for ALS. The collaborative, which now has funding to proceed with 5 million in Ice Bucket Challenge funding from The ALS Association, will focus on the following: (1) development of antisense therapy for the C9orf72 gene, the most common genetic cause of ALS, in partnership with Biogen-Idec and ISIS Pharmaceuticals; (2) gene therapy to down regulate SOD1, the second-most common ALS gene; (3) establishment of a Stem Cell and Motor Neuron Core Facility to create clinical-grade induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines, which will be openly shared with the ALS research community. iPS cells have emerged as a key research tool and potential source of therapeutic cells in ALS. 4) Using a novel screening tool, identify new targets for drug development and in partnership with the industry these leads will be developed further with the potential of new treatment options in the clinic. The Golden West Chapter of The ALS Association has played a key role in the planning and development of this project. Investigators: Don Cleveland, Ph.D. UCSD; Steven Finkbeiner, M.D., Ph.D., the Finkbeiner lab at the Gladstone Institutes; Clive Svendsen, Ph.D., Cedar Sinai Medical Center; and collaborators, Martin Marsala, M.D., UCSD; and Brian Kaspar, Ph.D., Children’s Hospital and Ohio State University. Project MinE Project MinE is a global collaboration with the goal to sequence the genomes of at least 15,000 people with ALS in an effort to discover new genes that affect ALS, either increasing the risk for the disease or protecting against it. The ALS Association’s funding commitment of 1 million will enable Project MinE to expand to the United States. It has become clear that risk for ALS is likely influenced by variants in multiple genes, each of which is relatively rare. The development of advanced sequencing technologies has dramatically reduced the cost of screening large numbers of individuals for these rare variants. Discovering these variants, and understanding how they contribute to disease, or protect against it, is likely to lead to novel approaches to ALS therapies. U.S. investigators: John Landers, Ph.D. University of Massachusetts, Worcester; Jonathan Glass, M.D., Emory University. International partners include the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Belgium. In addition to the abovementioned collaborative alliances to drive forward ALS research, The ALS Association’s Board of Trustees also approved two other projects to expedite the search for treatments and a cure for the disease through care services and public policy efforts. Grants to Certified Treatment Centers of Excellence The ALS Association and its network of chapters currently partner with 43 ALS Association Certified Treatment Centers of Excellence across the United States. Multiple studies have shown the value to a patient of attending a multidisciplinary clinic, including longer survival, increased quality of life, and improved access to potential therapies. One of the requirements in achieving certification through The ALS Association is for the institution to be actively involved in ALS-related research and to provide information to people living with the disease on research outside of their institution. Participation in clinical trials is imperative to the research process to find treatments for the disease. The Ice Bucket Challenge donations have enabled The Association to increase its annual grants to the centers from the presently budgeted 12,500 to 25,000 per center, which was the funding level pre-2008, for the next three years. Regulatory Guidance to Expedite Drug Development Organizations involved in two other neurological diseases (Alzheimer’s and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) have seen great benefits in working to develop guidance for companies to help them navigate the regulatory pathway for approval of effective therapies. The enactment of the patient-focused drug development elements of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) presents a unique opportunity for The ALS Association to help expedite drug development by developing similar guidance for ALS. No such guidance exists today for ALS, which creates uncertainty and risk for what is already a difficult and costly process. By developing this guidance, The ALS Association will be able to build on and strengthen its engagement with the FDA, industry and people with ALS about drug development as a regulatory process, which will reduce obstacles that can slow and limit innovation and access to effective treatments.

The funding marks the ALS Association’s first move toward distributing the 115 million it raised to fight the disease. “We are tripling the amount annually that we spend on research,” said ALS Association President Barbara Newhouse. “We have a sense of urgency, but we also we recognize that we have to be good stewards of the donor dollars as we move this forward as quickly as researchers can research.” Some of the first projects to receive funding include one trying to sequence the genes of 15,000 people with ALS, one partnering with pharmaceutical companies to advance drug treatment, and one developing gene therapy that might reduce the spread of the disease through the body. Hospitals and labs around the world that have received funding are Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, the University of California San Francisco, the New York Genome Center and others. The ALS Association has distributed more than 20 million so far and has committed to seeing any project it’s funded through to completion. In addition to funding research, the Ice Bucket Challenge money will be used to improve treatment for people living with disease, Newhouse said. Despite the organization’s now-deeper pockets, Newhouse insists that it will take time before the group will determine fully how to best leverage its influx in cash. Newhouse said she’s been “inundated with proposals” for research projects, and they continue to arrive in her inbox. “It’s been amazing how many people have come out of the woodwork to say ‘I have the answer,’” she said. “We’re trying to sort through what’s fact and what’s fiction.” And, while 100 million represents a marked increase in funding for the fight against ALS, Newhouse said it’s more of a starting point than the key to a solution. Newhouse thinks the funding could lead to a breakthrough—”I’m always a glass half-full kind of person,” she said. “But we would be kidding ourselves if anybody believed that 100 million is going to be all that’s needed to find an effective treatment.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"The ALS Association has announced that it will be tripling its spending on research, thanks to the Ice Bucket Challenge donations it has received.

In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased.

Given the question: Here's a question: What does exercising immediately lead to? Here are possible answers to this question: - relaxation - exhaustion - energetic - become stronger - use energy I believe the correct choice is \\"exhaustion\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"Exercising immediately leads to a variety of physiological and psychological responses, depending on an individual's fitness level, the type and duration of the exercise, and various other factors. While there is not one universally correct answer, \\"exhaustion\\" can be considered as the most appropriate choice due to its relevance to the immediate effects of exercise on the human body. Here's a detailed explanation of why \\"exhaustion\\" is the correct choice, while also addressing the other possible answers: 1. Exhaustion: When engaging in physical activity or exercise, the body requires an increased amount of energy to support muscle contractions and movements. This energy is primarily derived from the breakdown of sugars and fats in the body, converting them into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is then used to fuel body processes. As exercise continues, the body's available energy stores can become depleted, leading to muscle fatigue and a sense of exhaustion. Depletion of energy stores can manifest in feelings of muscle weakness, difficulty maintaining balance or precision in movements, and a general sense of tiredness. 2. Relaxation: Engaging in exercise can, in fact, lead to a sense of relaxation, although this is most commonly a secondary effect rather than an immediate one. Exercise has been known to release endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and mood enhancers, but their impact is not typically felt until after completing the workout. Physical exertion can also help release built-up tension in the body, promoting relaxation and a sense of well-being, but these effects are typically more pronounced after exercise completion than during the actual physical activity. 3. Energetic: While exercise can increase energy levels by promoting circulation, improving oxygen delivery to the muscles, and enhancing overall metabolism, this effect may not be immediate. Some individuals might experience a temporary increase in energy due to adrenaline release during exercise, but the energy levels are more likely to stabilize or increase after a consistent exercise routine rather than immediately after a single session. 4. Become stronger: Exercise can certainly lead to increased strength and muscle growth. However, becoming stronger is a long-term adaptation to consistent exercise rather than an immediate result. Physical strength gains occur as muscles are subjected to new or more challenging levels of resistance, leading to an increase in muscle size and function (hypertrophy). This muscle adaptation takes time and is not an immediate outcome of a single exercise session. 5.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? It is the best students he gives this book.","completion":"The sentence \\"It is the best students he gives this book\\" may be understood on a basic level, but it is not the most linguistically acceptable sentence in terms of English grammar, syntax, and style. Here's an in-depth explanation of its linguistic aspects: 1. Syntax and Word Order: The standard English syntax follows a subject-verb-object (SVO) word order. In the given sentence, the word order deviates from this standard structure. The sentence starts with a dummy subject or expletive, \\"It is\\" followed by \\"the best students he gives this book.\\" While expletives like \\"it is\\" are common in English, they are not necessary in this specific sentence. A more appropriate word order would be \\"He gives this book to the best students,\\" following the SVO structure. 2. Clarity and Readability: The given sentence is not the most straightforward way to express the idea. In fact, it sounds somewhat awkward and may lead to unnecessary confusion for the reader. Rewriting the sentence in a more clear and concise manner will improve its readability. For example, \\"He gives this book to the best students\\" is a more accurate and explicit way of conveying the same thought. 3. Emphasis: The sentence arrangement in the original example might be aiming to emphasize the \\"best students\\" by placing it at the beginning of the sentence. However, the emphasis is diluted due to the clumsy sentence structure and the use of the expletive \\"It is.\\" If you want to emphasize the \\"best students,\\" you can write the sentence as follows: \\"The best students are the ones he gives this book to.\\" This construction is more linguistically acceptable and conveys the intended focus. 4. Style: Stylistically, the original sentence seems to use an inversion technique, which can sometimes add variety or emphasis in a sentence. While inversions can work for specific cases, this particular sentence ends up being less fluent and exceeding the complexity needed to convey its meaning. In summary, the original sentence \\"It is the best students he gives this book\\" is not deemed linguistically acceptable due to its deviation from standard syntax, reduced clarity, and awkward construction. Rewriting the sentence as \\"He gives this book to the best students\\" is recommended for a more grammatically correct, precise, and readable expression. Meanwhile, if you want to emphasize the \\"best students,\\" you can use: \\"The best students are the ones he gives this book to.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the person whose actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government?, using the article: The Runaway Scrape events took place mainly between September 1835 and April 1836, and were the evacuations by Texas residents fleeing the Mexican Army of Operations during the Texas Revolution, from the Battle of the Alamo through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. The ad interim government of the new Republic of Texas and much of the civilian population fled eastward ahead of the Mexican forces. The conflict arose after Antonio López de Santa Anna abrogated the 1824 constitution of Mexico and established martial law in Coahuila y Tejas. The Texians resisted and declared their independence. It was Sam Houston's responsibility, as the appointed commander-in-chief of the Provisional Army of Texas (before such an army actually existed), to recruit and train a military force to defend the population against troops led by Santa Anna. Residents on the Gulf Coast and at San Antonio de Béxar began evacuating in January upon learning of the Mexican army's troop movements into their area, an event that was ultimately replayed across Texas. During early skirmishes, some Texian soldiers surrendered, believing that they would become prisoners of war — but Santa Anna demanded their executions. The news of the Battle of the Alamo and the Goliad massacre instilled fear in the population and resulted in the mass exodus of the civilian population of Gonzales, where the opening battle of the Texian revolution had begun and where, only days before the fall of the Alamo, they had sent a militia to reinforce the defenders at the mission. The civilian refugees were accompanied by the newly forming provisional army, as Houston bought time to train soldiers and create a military structure that could oppose Santa Anna's greater forces. Houston's actions were viewed as cowardice by the ad interim government, as well as by some of his own troops. As he and the refugees from Gonzales escaped first to the Colorado River and then to the Brazos, evacuees from other areas trickled in and new militia groups arrived to join with Houston's..., what would be the answer ?

It is used most commonly in Canada and the United States, where the two most popular outdoor team sports football and baseball require radically different facilities. Football uses a rectangular field (Canadian football fields are larger than American ones), while baseball is played on a diamond and large outfield.

Applicable Criteria and(New York Ratings Team) Can we infer the following? Fitch was paid for providing the ratings","completion":"Yes, based on the information provided in the passage, we can infer that Fitch Ratings was compensated for providing the ratings for the Illinois Finance Authority (IL Fin Auth) Revenue Bonds, 2008A, for Swedish Covenant Hospital. The statement, \\"The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings,\\" suggests that Fitch received payment for their services in evaluating and assigning the credit ratings. Fitch Ratings is a credit rating agency that assesses the creditworthiness of entities, such as corporations, governments, and financial instruments (e.g., bonds). The credit ratings assigned by agencies like Fitch help potential investors make informed decisions by offering an independent assessment of the risks associated with investing in these entities or financial instruments. In this specific case, Fitch has upgraded the long-term rating to 'A+' and confirmed the 'F1' rating on IL Fin Auth Revenues 2008A (Swedish Covenant Hospital). Credit rating agencies like Fitch are typically compensated by the issuers of those bonds or securities for the services they provide. This is because the issuers stand to benefit from positive credit ratings, which can lower their borrowing costs and increase investor interest. As a result, it is common for issuers to solicit the services of credit rating agencies and compensate them accordingly. In conclusion, the passage suggests that Fitch Ratings was indeed paid for providing the ratings for the Illinois Finance Authority Revenue Bonds, 2008A (Swedish Covenant Hospital), as the ratings were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and Fitch was compensated for their provision."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Option B, using a hose outside, is not ideal for several reasons. First, it's difficult to control the water temperature and pressure with a hose, which can lead to discomfort or even injury to the child.

Instead of providing a person who can talk about your skills and abilities, provide a copy of your actual work which will show your skills and abilities. For job seekers just entering the job market, consider using school work to demonstrate your abilities. Reports, presentations, papers, essays, journal articles, analyses, etc. can all demonstrate your skills and abilities. Be sure to redact any confidential or proprietary information in the documents. Most jobs include an evaluation at some point. And most evaluations are shared with you, so you can keep a copy. Share these evaluations to a potential employer if you aren’t able to provide a professional reference. This is especially helpful if your former employer isn’t allowed to provide you with a professional reference. Be sure to redact any confidential or proprietary information in the documents. In addition to evaluations, you can also try: letters of recognition, thank you letters from clients, testimonials from clients or fellow employees, and awards you’ve won. Corporate references are those written by an employee on behalf of an employer. The reference is then officially from the employer. Instead of asking for a corporate reference (on company letterhead), ask for a personal professional reference from a former supervisor or co-worker. Corporate references are becoming harder to obtain, even if you left your former employer for legitimate reasons. Many employers are concerned about lawsuits from providing either positive or negative references for former employees. Personal professional references are references directly from another person, and not connected to the employer. However, the person can be someone you previously worked for or with, as long as they’re providing the reference from themselves and not from their employer. Personal professional references need to ensure that they are speaking from their own personal experience working with you, and are not speaking as a representative of their employer. References do not always have to be verbal (e.g. phone call or email), they can also be in writing. Written references can include either an employment confirmation or information about your skills and abilities, or both. If you are being terminated from an employer for valid reasons (e.g. layoffs, cut backs, etc.) you should ask for a written reference letter as part of your severance agreement. This is especially helpful if the company is being reorganized or sold and contacting them will be difficult in the future. Potential employers will sometimes ask for references, not to ask questions about your skills and abilities, but to confirm you were actually employed at the companies listed on your resume. References of this type can come from a former supervisor (especially if the organization is small) or from the Human Resources (HR) department. Since your potential employer is not asking personal questions about you, the person confirming your employment doesn’t have to know you. They simply need to be able to confirm you used to work there for a specific period of time. Potential employers are most likely also frustrated with the lack of professional references they’re able to get from potential employees. You will not be the only applicant who is unable to provide a reference. When a potential employer asks for your references, negotiate what type and the number of references you provide. If you do not have any professional references, offer to provide twice as many personal references if you can. A personal reference can be from someone who knows you, but has never worked with you in a professional environment. For example, they could be a friend, a classmate, a teammate, a coach, a teacher, etc. Summary:","completion":"This article suggests job seekers provide actual work samples, evaluations, and personal professional references rather than corporate references to better demonstrate their skills and abilities to potential employers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Evaluate the statement \\"If No, surely she could not care for Bauerstein\\" means that if a certain condition is not met, we are confident she does not care for Bauerstein. Step 3: Determine the meaning of \\"not caring\\" Not caring for someone could imply indifference, dislike, or lack of affection. These interpretations can potentially lead us to infer that Bauerstein isn't someone who she has a particularly positive connection with. Step 4: Assess the conclusion The conclusion \\"Bauerstein was not one of her favorite people\\" implies that she doesn't hold Bauerstein in high regard. Step 5: Compare the statement with the conclusion Since the statement indicates that she doesn't care for Bauerstein, it is reasonable to infer that he is not one of her favorite people given that her opinions towards him are likely not positive.

Assisting Zionist causes Einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs. Among those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \\"evil\\" that was undermining a third of the country's development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important. Chaim Weizmann later became Israel's first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel's ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \\"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \\"deeply moved\\", and \\"at once saddened and ashamed\\" that he could not accept it.

Movie title: Gattaca Movie plot: In \\"the not-too-distant\\" future, where genetic engineering of humans is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class, Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is conceived and born without the aid of this technology. Suffering from the nearly eradicated physical dysfunctions of myopia and a congenital heart defect, as well as being given a life expectancy of 30.2 years, Vincent faces extreme genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way he can achieve his life-long dream of becoming an astronaut is to break the law and impersonate a \\"valid\\", a person with appropriate genetic advantage.[4]He assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a former swimming star who, despite a genetic profile \\"second to none\\", won only a silver medal in a high-profile competition. He then attempted to commit suicide by jumping in front of a car, but again fell short of his goal in that he only succeeded in paralyzing himself from the waist down. However, as the incident occurred outside the country, no one knows of his newly acquired disability. Thus, Vincent can \\"buy\\" his identity with no one the wiser. Though he requires orthopedic surgery to increase his height, persistant practice to favor his right hand instead of his left, and contact lenses to replace his glasses while matching Jerome's eyes, he can use his \\"valid\\" DNA in blood, tissue and urine samples to pass any genetic test - as long as he takes extreme measures to leave no traces of his identity as an \\"in-valid\\". But, where he was once an object of scorn and pity, he is now a perpetrator of an unspeakable fraud. Legally, exposure would only subject him to fines, but socially the consequences would be far more extreme - he is now a heretic against the new order of genetic determinism. Vincent is now a \\"borrowed ladder\\" (a reference to the ladder structure of an un-coiled DNA strand) or in harsher language, a de-gene-erate.With Jerome's impressive genetic profile he easily gains access to the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation (his interview consists... Answer:","completion":"Vincent (Ethan Hawke) saves Anton from drowning.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which river had a food source mostly derived from algae? Hint: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.","completion":"The text does not provide specific information on which river, Olt or Mures, had a food source mostly derived from algae.

Choose from options. \\"How does darkness impact photosynthesis?\\" Select from: 1). positively; 2). increases absorption; 3). very poorly; 4). increases endurance;","completion":"To answer the question \\"How does darkness impact photosynthesis?\\" based on the evidence provided, we'll first briefly look at the relationship between darkness and photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a process in which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy. This is essential for their growth and survival. Photosynthesis has two main stages – the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle). Light energy is required for the first stage to occur. Darkness directly affects photosynthesis by limiting or completely stopping the light-dependent reactions. Without light, these reactions cannot take place, and consequently, the entire process of photosynthesis is halted or significantly slowed down. Now, let's analyze each option: 1). positively - The evidence suggests that darkness has a negative impact on photosynthesis, so this option is not correct. 2). increases absorption - Darkness would decrease light absorption since there is no light to absorb in the first place, so this option is not correct. 3). very poorly - This option aligns with the given evidence, as darkness has a negative impact on photosynthesis. 4). increases endurance - There is no indication that darkness would increase endurance in the context of photosynthesis. Based on the given evidence and analysis, the correct answer is: 3). very poorly"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kett's Rebellion was a revolt in Norfolk, England during the reign of Edward VI, largely in response to the enclosure of land. It began at Wymondham on 8 July 1549 with a group of rebels destroying fences that had been put up by wealthy landowners. One of their targets was yeoman farmer Robert Kett who, instead of resisting the rebels, agreed to their demands and offered to lead them. Kett and his forces, joined by recruits from Norwich and the surrounding countryside and numbering some 16,000, set up camp on Mousehold Heath to the north-east of the city on 12 July. The rebels stormed Norwich on 29 July and took the city. But on 1 August the rebels were defeated by an army led by the Marquess of Northampton who had been sent by the government to suppress the uprising. Kett's rebellion ended on 27 August when the rebels were defeated by an army under the leadership of the Earl of Warwick at the Battle of Dussindale.

Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options Some options can immediately be eliminated as irrelevant. Ireland is a country and not a business, so it is not a suitable answer for the question. Step 3: Compare the remaining options Now, a human would compare the remaining options: fast food restaurant, vegetable market, produce market, and dessert spot. Step 4: Identify the option with the heaviest potato usage A vegetable market and produce market sell a variety of fruits and vegetables, including potatoes, but they do not necessarily use a lot of potatoes. Potatoes may be one of many products they sell, so their usage is more diverse and not focused on potatoes. A dessert spot may use potatoes in some cases, but does not generally use large quantities of potatoes as the primary ingredient in their offerings. Step 5: Recognize the potato-heavy nature of fast-food restaurants A fast food restaurant, on the other hand, often serves large quantities of items such as fries, hash browns, or other potato-based products.

Let's break it down step by step: 1. Sharon asks Peter if Ben is with him, which means she is trying to locate or reach Ben. 2. Peter replies \\"No\\" in response to Sharon's question and asks for reasons, which means Ben is not present with him. 3. Sharon tells Peter that she is unable to reach Ben, which further clarifies that she is concerned about getting in touch with Ben for some reason. 4. Peter informs Sharon that Ben is in a meeting, which justifies Ben's unavailability at the moment. 5. Sharon decides to leave a message for Ben and asks Peter to convey it if he happens to see Ben. She mentions she is waiting downstairs, which indicates her physical location or the place where she wants to meet Ben. 6. Peter agrees to do so, indicating that he will pass on the message to Ben when he sees him.

It is well known as the terminal station of the first railroad built in Cuba and Latin America in 1831. It also hosts one of the most popular and traditional carnival fest in Cuba: \\"Charangas de Bejucal\\". Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Bejucal was founded in 1831","completion":"The sentence \\"Bejucal was founded in 1831\\" does not accurately follow the preceding text, as it mentions that Bejucal was founded in 1874. However, it is important to note that Bejucal has a significant connection to the year 1831, as it served as the terminal station for the first railroad built in Cuba and Latin America, which was constructed in that year. This event had a considerable impact on Bejucal's history and development, and it is likely that the town's population and economic activities increased as a result of this infrastructure improvement. In spite of the connection to the 1831 railroad, Bejucal was officially founded in 1874, which is more than four decades after the construction of the iconic railroad. As a result, it is essential to maintain an accurate representation of the historical timeline by stating that Bejucal was founded in 1874. Furthermore, it should be emphasized that the town's well-known association with the traditional Cuban carnival fest, \\"Charangas de Bejucal,\\" highlights the town's rich cultural heritage and vibrant atmosphere. In summary, while 1831 is an important year in Bejucal's history due to the completion of the first railroad in the region, the statement \\"Bejucal was founded in 1831\\" does not correctly follow the preceding text, as the town was founded in 1874. Nevertheless, the significance of the 1831 railroad and the annual \\"Charangas de Bejucal\\" event do contribute to the unique character and essence of Bejucal, making it an interesting and historically significant place in Cuba."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But comets are not made of solid rocks like planets. A comet is a ball of dust, stones, and ice. Many people call comets dirty snowballs. The \\"snowball\\" may be only a few miles across. But when the sun heats the \\"snowball,\\" much of it is changed to gases. The gases spread out and form the comet's head, which may be thousands of miles across. A comet moves fast in its trip around the sun. But when we see it, the comet does not seem to move. That's because it is so far away. The moon moves fast, but when you look at it, you can't see any motion . That's because the moon is far away. Each year astronomers discover new comets. Some of them are seen only once. They make one trip around the sun and then go away out into space. The sun's gravity cannot hold them. Other comets, like Halley, keep returning. They have been captured by the sun. Halley's earliest visit was probably 3,000 years ago. It may keep returning for another 3,000 years. But every time a comet goes around the sun, the comet loses part of itself. Gases and dust are pulled out of the comet. That's why Halley is now dimmer than it used to be. Next time it visits us, in 2062, it may be even dimmer. Each visit it may get dimmer and dimmer, until it finally disappears. Question: What is this passage mostly about? Options: A: Comets and the sun. B: Why comets are like snowballs.

Density is a measure of mass per unit of volume, and it typically affects the weight of a substance. In this case, rocks have a higher mass per unit volume than feathers, meaning rocks are denser.

Justification: Eating more food could potentially cause an increase in blood sugar levels, as the body needs to break down and process the additional food intake. This increased blood sugar level would initiate a response from the pancreas to release insulin.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To prevent cake from sticking to the cake pan.","completion":"To stop a cake from sticking to the cake pan, follow these simple steps: 1. First, take your cake pan and make sure it's clean and dry. 2. Now, we need to grease the pan. You can use butter, shortening, or non-stick spray for this. Just spread a thin layer all around the inside of the pan. This will help the cake slide out easily after it's baked. 3. Next, we're going to use some flour to help the cake unstick even better. Take a little bit of flour and sprinkle it inside the greased pan. Move the pan around so the flour covers the bottom and sides evenly. 4. Don't forget to tap out any extra flour! Just hold the pan upside down over a trash can or sink and gently tap it until the extra flour falls away. Now your pan is ready for the cake batter! After baking the cake, let it cool for a bit before trying to remove it from the pan. The cake should unstick nicely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What is a synonym for faith? Possible A: trust, move mountains, uplift, belief, experience Why is \\"belief\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"\\"Belief\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense as a synonym for faith, because both words refer to a strong conviction or confidence in something that may not be seen, experienced, or proven. While some of the other suggested answers may have a somewhat related meaning, \\"belief\\" is the one that stands out as being most synonymous with \\"faith.\\" In general, \\"faith\\" and \\"belief\\" are often used interchangeably to describe the level of trust, assurance, or commitment an individual has towards an idea, concept, or entity. This could range from religious faith (e.g., faith in God) to personal faith (e.g., having faith in someone's abilities or a particular outcome). Now let's see why the other options are not as closely aligned with \\"faith\\": 1. Trust: While trust is related to faith and belief, it is generally more specific and applies to personal relationships or to trusting institutions or objects. For example, you might trust a friend to keep your secret, but faith typically extends beyond trust to encompass more abstract concepts. 2. Move mountains: This phrase is a metaphor describing the power of faith or belief to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. It is not a direct synonym for faith but instead denotes an effect or outcome of faith. 3. Uplift: Uplift refers to raising someone's spirits, improving their mood, or offering moral support. While faith and belief can be uplifting, the term \\"uplift\\" is not a synonym for faith. 4. Experience: Experience is the practical knowledge or skill gained through direct involvement or observation of events. Faith, on the other hand, often involves trusting in something that hasn't been personally experienced or observed. Experience can contribute to or shape one's faith, but it is not a synonym for faith. In conclusion, \\"belief\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it most closely matches the meaning of \\"faith\\" and conveys a similar sense of strong conviction or confidence in something."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And of course we had to get clear from the A concourse to the C concourse , but the Minneapolis airport has those moving sidewalk things - but I was still huffing and puffing by the time we got to our gate , and the plane took off maybe 15 minutes later . The flight from St. Louis to Minneapolis was CRAMPED . The plane held maybe 50 people , two per side , and it was pretty uncomfortable . We were supposed to be on a Boeing 747 for the flight to Anchorage , but it was a 757 instead . Answer the following question: Why was the plane ride so uncomfortable ?","completion":"The plane ride from St. Louis to Minneapolis was uncomfortable due to several factors that contributed to the overall negative passenger experience. Here is a comprehensive breakdown of the reasons for the discomfort: 1. Aircraft size: The small aircraft, with a capacity of around 50 people and a seating arrangement of two per side, limited the amount of personal space for passengers. Smaller planes are typically more confined, which can lead to feelings of overcrowding and claustrophobia, especially on a full flight. 2. Seating design: The seats in smaller planes often have less padding and legroom than those found in larger, more modern aircraft. This can make it difficult for passengers to feel comfortable and relaxed, as they have to spend their journey in tight and constrained positions. 3. Aircraft change: The flight to Anchorage was initially scheduled to be boarded on a Boeing 747, which is a larger aircraft known for its spacious and comfortable layout. However, due to undisclosed reasons, the aircraft type was changed to a 757 instead. This change in plane might have caused passengers to feel more cramped than they expected, leading to further discomfort. 4. Physical exertion before boarding: The journey through the Minneapolis airport was quite energy-consuming due to the long walk required to get from the A concourse to the C concourse. Even with the help of the moving sidewalk, you were still huffing and puffing when you reached the gate. This physical exertion and rush could have made you more sensitive to the discomfort during the flight, impacting your overall experience on the plane. 5. Limited time between flights: The plane took off just 15 minutes after you arrived at the gate, which means there was no time to recover from the stress and tiredness induced by the hustle and bustle at the airport. This lack of resting time can amplify the feeling of discomfort as it does not allow passengers to mentally prepare for the next flight. 6. Anxiety levels: Traveling can be inherently stressful, and factors like rushing between concourses, unexpected changes in aircraft, and dealing with cramped seating conditions can lead to increased anxiety levels, further magnifying the feeling of discomfort. In conclusion, the uncomfortable plane ride from St. Louis to Minneapolis can be attributed to a combination of factors, such as the small size of the aircraft, limited seating space, the change in aircraft for the onward journey, physical exhaustion, anxiety, and limited time between flights. These factors collectively contributed to the overall cramped and uncomfortable experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I got there and the lady brought it out to me and it wasn't even round. It looked like a square. I was shocked and she said they couldn't round it out because they had taken it down so much in size that it might crack. I wasn't happy and so she gave it back to the person in the back room and I waited a few minutes. The groove where it was cut was now smoothed out but the ring was still square! She told me if I wasn't happy with it in a few days that I could bring it back and that it was covered through them. Without breaking down in tears, I said let's skip the couple days of me being unhappy and do something for me now. She then gave it back to the person in the back room and gave it back to me round.

Original Statement: \\"A crowd of people waving red flags are passing under a bridge.\\" In this statement, we know that there is a crowd of people carrying red flags, and they are walking under a bridge. 2. Proposed Conclusion: \\"A group of people under a bridge that's about to collapse.\\" In this conclusion, we have a group of people under a bridge, similar to the original statement. However, there's an added piece of information suggesting that the bridge is about to collapse. Now, let's logically analyze the situation: Step 1: Identify common elements in both statements. The common elements are the presence of a group of people and the fact that they are under a bridge. Step 2: Compare the differences in the information provided between the two statements. The first statement mentions the people waving red flags, while the second statement suggests the bridge is about to collapse. Step 3: Determine if the proposed conclusion logically follows from the original statement. From the original statement, we have no information regarding the structural integrity of the bridge or any reason to believe that the bridge is about to collapse. The only additional information available in the original statement is that the people are waving red flags, which has no direct correlation to the bridge's potential collapse. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, it does not logically follow that a group of people is under a bridge that's about to collapse simply because they are waving red flags. There must be additional information connecting the people waving red flags to the bridge's collapse for it to be considered a logical connection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does word \\"authority\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? Respect my authority! I have the authority to penalise the staff in my department, but not the authority to sack them.","completion":"To determine if the word \\"authority\\" has the same meaning in both sentences, I will analyze the context and definitions of \\"authority\\" in both sentences step-by-step. 1. Understand the context of both sentences: In the first sentence, \\"Respect my authority!\\" it seems to be a command or an expression of one's power or control, likely spoken by someone who is in a position of authority, such as a supervisor or a leader. In the second sentence, \\"I have the authority to penalize the staff in my department, but not the authority to sack them,\\" the speaker is describing the scope of their power due to their position, such as the ability to impose penalties but not to fire staff members. 2. Consider the definitions of \\"authority\\": \\"Authority\\" usually has a few related meanings, including: a. The power or right to give orders, make decisions, or enforce obedience b. A person or organization having control or power, such as someone possessing a certain position c. The power to influence others because of one's competence, credibility, or expertise 3. Analyze \\"authority\\" in both sentences: In the first sentence, \\"Respect my authority!\\" \\"authority\\" refers to the power or control the speaker possesses, aligning with definition \\"a\\" or \\"b,\\" as they are asking others to respect their authority as a person or due to their position. In the second sentence, \\"I have the authority to penalize the staff in my department, but not the authority to sack them,\\" \\"authority\\" refers to a specific scope or level of power the speaker has due to their position. This also aligns with definition \\"a\\" or \\"b,\\" highlighting specific facets of their power and limits related to it. Conclusion: In both sentences, the word \\"authority\\" holds the same general meaning, referring to the power, control, or right to make decisions or enforce obedience, stemming from a position of control or power that the speaker has. While the contexts differ, with one being a commanding statement and the other describing specific scopes of power, the underlying meaning of \\"authority\\" remains the same."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed.

Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent.

Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \\"Gigi\\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \\"Hoolly Golinghtly\\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \\"Eliza Doolittle\\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice.

Article: It is a plain fact that we are in a world where competition is going on in all areas and at all levels. This is exciting.Yet,on the other hand,competition breezes a pragmatic attitude.People choose to learn things that are useful,and do things that are profitable.Today's college education is also affected by this general sense of utilitarianism . Many colleges students choose Business,Law not Computer Programming as their majors convinced that these professions are where the big money is.It is not unusual to see the college students taking a part--time job as a warm--up for the real battle.I often see my friends taking GRE tests,working on English or computer certificates and taking the driving tests to get a license.Well,I have nothing against being practical.As the competition in the job market gets more and more severe,students do have reasons to be practical. However,we should never forget that college education is much more than skill training.Just imagine,if your utilitarianism becomes the main trend on campus,leaving no space for the cultivation of students' minds,or development of their soul.We will see university is training out well--trained spiritless working machines.If utilitarianism controls society,we will see people lost in the money--making adventures;we will see humanity losing their grace and dignity,and that,would be disastrous.I'd like to think society as encouraging and people regard profit or fame only as a horse that pulls the courage.Yet without the driver picking direction,the courage would go straight and may even end out in a dangerous situation.

This year's class of 64 worked to design, develop and document an idea for a 2,100-square-foot, wheelchair-accessible, two-family house. Students had to use sustainable resources and energy-efficient technology. The budget for the project is always less than actual construction costs, and the builders-in-training had to seek supplementary donations, mostly in the form of construction materials. The result this year was a \\"designer\\" home, dressed entirely in cedar , fitted inside with Swedish-designed cabinetry and partially powered by solar energy. The floors are bamboo, another natural material prized for being quickly replenished . This year, the student-builders used a pre-cast foundation system, which, in addition to its other labor-saving virtues, uses 75% less concrete than the poured system.

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]","completion":"Step 1: Identify the question The question is \\"A non-serious violation of Bible principles can be penalized by what?\\" Step 2: Analyze the context The context discusses the different forms of discipline administered by congregation elders for baptized members who commit serious sin or violate Bible principles. Step 3: Search for relevant information In the context, we find a mention of discipline for a violation of Bible principles that is not a serious sin: \\"Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.\\" Step 4: Extract the answer From the information found, we can conclude that a non-serious violation of Bible principles can be penalized by marking, which is a curtailing of social (but not spiritual) fellowship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: yeah there was a little girl picked up in Rowlett from uh from her front yard and her dad was working in the back yard and had just left her few minutes in the front yard and somebody apparently drove up and took her and they never saw her again Hypothesis: A little girl in Rowlett was abducted and never found, the parents blame themselves. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To answer the question of whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's first define entailment. Entailment, in the context of logic and reasoning, means that the truth of one statement (the premise) logically implies, or guarantees, the truth of the other statement (the hypothesis). Now, let's examine the details given in the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: 1. A little girl was picked up in Rowlett. 2. She was taken from her front yard. 3. Her father was working in the back yard and had left her for a few minutes. 4. An unknown person drove up and abducted her. 5. She was never found. Hypothesis: 1. A little girl in Rowlett was abducted and never found. 2. The parents blame themselves. Comparing the two, we can see that the first part of the hypothesis is directly supported by the information provided in the premise - the little girl in Rowlett was indeed abducted and never found. Therefore, this part of the hypothesis can be said to be entailed by the premise. However, the second part of the hypothesis, which states that the parents blame themselves, is not directly supported by the information given in the premise. While it might be a plausible assumption to make given the circumstances, there is nothing in the premise that explicitly states this. Thus, we cannot say for certain that the premise entails this part of the hypothesis. In conclusion, while the premise entails the first part of the hypothesis, it does not entail the second part of the hypothesis about the parents blaming themselves. The hypothesis, as a whole, is not entirely entailed by the premise. Instead, the hypothesis combines both information guaranteed by the premise (a girl was abducted and never found) and a plausible assumption (the parents might blame themselves) that is not explicitly stated in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 17:52 EST, 15 July 2012 | UPDATED: 09:19 EST, 16 July 2012 Mitt Romney's campaign said on Sunday that President Barack Obama is willing to say anything to win a second term and should say he's sorry for attacks on the Republican's successful career at a private equity firm. But the president was adamant about his stance saying, 'No, we will not apologize,' adding that if Romney wants credit for his business leadership, he also needs to take responsibility. Questions about Romney's tenure at Bain Capital and the fortune he earned there have dogged the former Massachusetts governor as Obama and his allies have said the Boston-based firm shipped jobs overseas. But at least three times since then, OPTIONS: - Bain Capital listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Barack Obama listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Boston listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Daily Mail listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Ed Gillespie listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Massachusetts listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Mitt Romney listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Obama listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Republican listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' - Romney listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.'","completion":"Bain Capital listed Romney as the company's 'controlling person,' as well as its 'sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president.' The other choices are incorrect because: - Barack Obama, Daily Mail, Ed Gillespie, Massachusetts, Obama, Republican, and Romney are all individuals/entities that are not in a position to list Romney as the controlling person in Bain Capital. The correct answer should be the company itself, Bain Capital. - Boston is incorrect as it is a city, and not directly related to Romney or Bain Capital in terms of listing him as a controlling person for the company. - Mitt Romney listing himself would not be an official or accurate representation of his position within Bain Capital. It is the company’s responsibility, in this case, Bain Capital, to list the controlling person."},{"prompt":"Options are: -Yes -No Q: If I tell you that Wolves hunt by sensing light, and ask you the question \\"how do wolves hunt?\\", is the correct answer \\"trees\\"?

Thus, the passage would read: Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is likely to blame his 'role model' dead brother at trial to avoid the death penalty. When Tsarnaev's case begins, his lawyers are likely to pin their hopes - and the bombings themselves - on his older brother, Tamerlan: a Golden Gloves boxer, college student, husband and father who also followed radical Islam was named by a friend as a participant in a grisly 2011 triple slaying.

This option is the most logical choice as it demonstrates the influence Tamerlan had on his siblings and emphasizes his role as a role model in their lives.

Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is understood to be the weather of Earth. Paragraph: David was interested in climate change issues. He realized that to understand climate change issues he first needed to distinguish between the terms weather and climate. To that end, he labeled weather as term A. Then he labeled climate as term B. He found it easier to understand their differences in that way. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which may not use average atmospheric conditions, term A or term B? The answer is:","completion":"Term A may not use average atmospheric conditions. In the given paragraph, David labeled weather as term A and climate as term B. Weather refers to the day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity in a specific atmospheric area at a given time, whereas climate is defined by the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. Since term A represents weather, it is associated with short-term and individual meteorological events instead of the average atmospheric conditions. Weather phenomena typically occur in the troposphere and include elements like temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. These factors can change within minutes, hours, or days, and can lead to various local weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy. On the other hand, term B represents climate, which is mainly concerned with average atmospheric conditions over long-term periods, often spanning multiple years or even decades. Climate takes into account the persistent behavior of weather elements and patterns for a specific region. Climatologists study these long-term data sets to understand the natural variability and identify emerging trends, such as global warming and climate change. In summary, term A (weather) may not use average atmospheric conditions, as it deals with short-term fluctuations and specific meteorological events, whereas term B (climate) characterizes the long-term behavior and averages of atmospheric conditions in a given region."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Story highlights Wilson shot and killed teenager Michael Brown on August 9 Sources: Wilson has told associates he would resign to protect his fellow officers Wilson doesn't know what grand jury will do and could change his mind, sources say Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed teenager Michael Brown on August 9, is in the final stages of negotiations with city officials to resign, according to people close to the talks. Wilson maintains he hasn't done anything wrong, and the resignation talks have hinged on whether a grand jury returns an indictment against him in the death of Brown, people close to the talks said. Wilson has told associates he would resign as a way to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers. Wilson has expressed concern about resigning while the grand jury was hearing evidence for fear it would appear he was admitting fault. Wilson could announce as soon as Friday his plans to resign, the same day a St. Louis County grand jury meets to deliberate and possibly decide on an indictment.

(AP) — The suburban St. Louis police officer who fatally shot Michael Brown seems confident that he will not face criminal charges from a grand jury that has been investigating the case for several months, a police union official said Thursday. FILE - In this Feb. 11, 2014 file image from video provided by the City of Ferguson, Mo., officer Darren Wilson attends a city council meeting in Ferguson. Wilson is not expecting to face criminal charges... (Associated Press) Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met Thursday with Ferguson officer Darren Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the Aug. 9 shooting that sparked tense and occasionally violent protests and drew national attention. Wilson has been under a lot of pressure and stress but appeared confident in the outcome of the grand jury investigation, Roorda said. \\"It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,\\" Roorda said, offering his impression of the situation based on the meeting with Wilson. Roorda later told the AP in a text message that he was only speaking for himself. \\"Wilson seems confident that justice will be served, but neither he nor his attorneys shared any expectations with me,\\" he said in the text. One of Wilson's attorneys, who also attended Thursday's meeting, said there was no specific discussion of expectations. \\"We have absolutely no idea — no more than anyone else — what may or may not happen,\\" attorney Neil Bruntrager said. \\"The only expectation that we would have is that the grand jury would be thorough and fair.\\" If he is indicted, Wilson will immediately turn himself in to authorities, Bruntrager said. Wilson has been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. A 12-person St. Louis County grand jury has been hearing evidence in the case as it weighs whether to issue charges against the white officer for the black 18-year-old's death. A decision could come soon, though authorities have not publicized any specific date for an announcement. Roorda said St. Louis city police have been notified that they are switching to 12-hour shifts starting Saturday, a preparation for a potential uptick in protests. The St. Louis County Police Department has not yet decided whether to switch to longer work shifts, spokesman Brian Schellman said. For weeks, local and state police have been preparing for a grand jury announcement in anticipation that it will result in renewed protests. Earlier this week, Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to help with security. Authorities have said Wilson shot Brown, who was unarmed, following some sort of physical confrontation that occurred after Wilson told Brown and a friend to stop walking down the center of a street. Wilson told authorities that the shooting happened after Brown struggled with him for his gun, according to reports by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the New York Times that cited unnamed sources. But some witnesses have said Brown had his arms raised — as if to surrender — when the fatal shot was fired. Riots and looting occurred a day after the shooting, and protesters filled the streets for weeks. Police responded by firing tear gas and smoke canisters into crowds of demonstrators after some people threw rocks and Molotov cocktails. Protests have been nearly constant since the shooting. The vast majority of protesters want to see the officer charged with murder. Many are also pushing for changes in the way police and the courts interact with minorities. A handful of demonstrations have been in support of Wilson. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for Brown's family, described the investigation as an \\"emotional roller-coaster\\" for his clients. Even if Wilson is indicted, there's no guarantee of a conviction. And if he isn't charged, Crump said Thursday, \\"they get no chance of justice for their child.\\" Crump said he had no insight into the timing of the grand jury's decision, but that he expected to be notified ahead of any public announcement. Wilson has incurred significant legal, medical and relocation expenses, and a police charity has raised close to 500,000 for him, Roorda said. ___ Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report. ___ Follow David A.

Push the extension rod into the object for a depth measurement. Look at the digital reading. Article:","completion":"Title: How to Use Your Calipers: A Simple Guide for Kids Hi there, little ones! Today, we are going to learn about a super cool tool called 'calipers'. Calipers help us measure different things easily and quickly. Do you want to know how to use them? Great! Let's start our exciting journey together! Step 1 - Make it Zero! Before we start measuring anything, the first thing we need to do is to make the calipers 'zero'. It helps us prepare the tool for measuring. So, how do we do that? Just press the 'zero' button (sometimes it can also be called the 'on/off' button) on your digital calipers, and that's it! Your calipers are now ready for action! Step 2 - Let's Measure the Outside! Calipers have two special parts called 'jaws'. These jaws help the calipers to hold and measure things. To measure the outside of an object, open the jaws wide and gently hold the object between the jaws (like a big hug!). Make sure the jaws touch the object on its two sides. Now, you have one part of the jaws on one side of the object and the other on the opposite side. Hold your calipers steady and check the digital reading - this is the size of your object from the outside! Step 3 - Time to Discover the Inside! Sometimes, we also need to know the size of the inside of an object. In this case, we will use the open parts of the jaws. Place these open parts inside the object, touching the inner walls. Be gentle not to press too hard! Now, again, take a look at the digital reading. This tells you the size of the object from the inside! Step 4 - Going Deep! You can also use your calipers to measure how deep something is. For this, you will need the 'extension rod,' which is a thin metal stick at the end of your calipers. Gently push the extension rod inside the part of the object you want to measure. Make sure it reaches the bottom. Once it does, take a look at the digital reading on the calipers. This will tell you the depth of your object! Now you know how to use calipers for different measurements! Good job! With practice, you'll become a caliper master in no time. Have fun measuring lots of things and discovering more about our world!"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},W={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],j={key:0},R={key:1};function D(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",W,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
