How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? has a lot to do from now til tues and is a grumpy gus.","completion":"The sentiment of this tweet can be characterized as predominantly negative with an underlying tone of frustration and a hint of playfulness. Here's a more detailed analysis of the tweet's sentiment: 1. Predominantly negative: The tweet as a whole communicates a sense of unease and irritation on the part of the author. This is evident in their mention of the numerous tasks they need to complete before Tuesday and their self-proclamation as a \\"grumpy gus\\". 2. Underlying frustration: It can be inferred that the user is feeling overwhelmed or stressed by the volume or nature of the tasks they must accomplish before the mentioned deadline. This can evoke a sense of frustration and anxiety as they worry about the impending tasks, contributing to the overall negative sentiment. 3. Hint of playfulness: Despite the overall negativity of the tweet, there is a slight element of playfulness in the language the user employs. The term \\"grumpy gus\\" is a colloquial expression that carries an endearing and lighthearted tone. Using this phrase instead of a more serious description, such as \\"angry\\" or \\"upset,\\" suggests that the user is possibly attempting to mitigate the impact of their negative feelings with a touch of humor, which can be seen as a form of emotional self-regulation. In conclusion, the sentiment of this tweet can best be described as mainly negative and expressing feelings of frustration due to a significant number of tasks that need completion before an upcoming deadline. However, the use of playful language also demonstrates the user's attempt to moderate their emotions and cope with a potentially stressful situation."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Unbeknownst to them, they are driving straight into the heart of a terrifying mystery; a monstrous and vengeful bear is on the loose, attacking and destroying anything in its path. Plot: Act 1: The film opens in the vibrant city of Goldwell, where five friends - Michael, Sarah, Alex, Jess, and Brian - plan an exciting weekend getaway to explore a forgotten cabin that once belonged to a wealthy family, the Whitmores. According to local myths, a fortune in gold and precious stones lies hidden within the cabin's walls, waiting to be uncovered. The group load up their trusty SUV and embark on the journey, filled with anticipation. Act 2: As they make their way through the breathtaking Northridge Mountains, what should have been a leisurely drive takes a tragic turn. They come across a flipped car with its doors ripped apart, and the passengers nowhere to be seen. The friends grow increasingly wary, noticing the unmistakable signs of a vicious attack. Barely managing to continue on their quest, they reach the disheveled cabin, which is nestled deep within the forest. As they split up to investigate different parts of the cabin and its surroundings, the first mysterious attack occurs, with Alex discovering strange, large claw marks on their SUV. Act 3: A piercing roar echoes through the woods, and the friends regroup, but now they are trapped, unable to leave on their disabled vehicle. Night falls, and it becomes increasingly clear that they are being stalked by a cunning and relentless predator - a gigantic, malevolent bear that seeks vengeance for the cruel poaching of its family. While the group huddles inside the cabin, they discover old journals belonging to the Whitmore family. The secrets within reveal that the family had long been involved in illegal animal trafficking of bears. Overcome with remorse and a sense of responsibility, Michael shares his own dark secret: his late grandfather was the last surviving heir of the Whitmore family. Guilt-ridden and determined to atone, the group decides to fight back. Act 4: Armed with makeshift weapons, the desperate friends must rely on teamwork, strategy, and their own courage to outwit and defeat the bear, which itself is imbued with a supernatural force. After several harrowing encounters that test the friends' resolve, they finally manage to get the upper hand on the vengeful bear. In a heart-stopping showdown, the bear is defeated, and the group narrowly survives, forever bonded by their harrowing experience. Epilogue: Weeks later, they return to the cabin to retrieve the hidden treasure. Instead of claiming it for themselves, they donate the wealth to wildlife preservation efforts, honoring the memory of the fallen bear and taking a stand against animal cruelty. In \\"Bear Claw,\\" the intense thriller meets heart-pounding horror as the audience experiences the undeniable power of the untamed wilderness and the importance of preserving nature's balance.

Article: In early November of 1503,during Christopher Columbus's fourth and final trip to America,his ship was seriously damaged in a storm.Columbus and his men had to live on a small island for several months while they tried to repair their ship and return to Spain. At first,the local people on the island were very kind to the European visitors,giving them allthe food and clothes they needed to survive.However,as the months passed,the local people became more and more unhappy with their guests,who were tricking and stealing from them.Finally the locals decided to stop helping.Without food or any way to leave the island,Columbus's group was soon in serious trouble. Luckily for Columbus,he had a book about the stars and planets on his ship.It described the movements of all the objects in the night sky.The book,written by a well-known German scientist,said there would be a total lunar eclipse on the evening of February 29,1504 and how long it would last. Columbus worked out the difference in time between Germ any and North America.He then had a meeting with the local leaders just before the eclipse would take place.In this meeting,Columbus told them his god was angry because the local people were no longer giving food.So his god would take away the moon to punish them.The moment Columbus finished talking,just as he had planned,the moon began disappearing. The local leaders grew frightened and quickly agreed to provide Columbus with food and anything else he wanted.But first,Columbus's god had to return the moon.Columbus told them he would have to discuss the idea with his god on his ship.Knowing the moon would stay completely hidden for about 48 minutes,Columbus returned just before the moon began to reappear.From that day on,until they finally left,Columbus and his men no longer had any trouble getting the food they needed.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs I am facing a new situation today: Justin is conducting a chemical experiment involving sodium hydroxide. A key part of the reaction is ensuring that the sodium hydroxide is dissolved in water before adding the other materials. Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction A, and sets the heat to high. Justin can't use high heat for his second reaction, though, because the electricity supply is too weak to have both burners on high. Because of this, Justin adds the sodium hydroxide to reaction B and sets the heat to low. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which reaction will the sodium hydroxide dissolve faster? Answer:","completion":"The sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in reaction A. The reason for this is based on the concepts mentioned in the background article you read. The rate at which a solute (in this case, sodium hydroxide) dissolves in a solvent (water) is affected by three main factors: stirring, temperature, and surface area. In the situation you described, the variable that changes between Reaction A and Reaction B is the temperature, assuming the amount of sodium hydroxide and the stirring are the same in both reactions. Justin has set the heat higher in Reaction A compared to Reaction B. The greater the temperature, the faster the dissolving process. This is due to the fact that heat increases the energy of the molecules, causing them to move faster and thereby dissolve the solute faster. So, because Reaction A is being heated at a high temperature, the sodium hydroxide will dissolve faster in Reaction A than in Reaction B, which is heated at a lower temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that recorded travelers being assaulted by bandits on the road that reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi? Although the Silk Road from China to Europe and the Western World was initially formulated during the reign of Emperor Wu (141–87 BC) during the Han, it was reopened by the Tang in 639 when Hou Junji (d. 643) conquered the West, and remained open for almost four decades. It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon. Answer:","completion":"The name of the person that recorded travelers being assaulted by bandits on the road that reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi is the monk Xuanzang. Xuanzang was a Chinese Buddhist monk and traveler who documented his experiences along the Silk Road, including instances of assault by bandits and the strict border laws enforced by the Chinese government."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Who gives the name and also is credited today for proposing a theory of inheritance of aquired characteristics? Context: Scientific readers were already aware of arguments that species changed through processes that were subject to laws of nature, but the transmutational ideas of Lamarck and the vague \\"law of development\\" of Vestiges had not found scientific favour. Darwin presented natural selection as a scientifically testable mechanism while accepting that other mechanisms such as inheritance of acquired characters were possible. His strategy established that evolution through natural laws was worthy of scientific study, and by 1875, most scientists accepted that evolution occurred but few thought natural selection was significant. Darwin's scientific method was also disputed, with his proponents favouring the empiricism of John Stuart Mill's A System of Logic, while opponents held to the idealist school of William Whewell's Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, in which investigation could begin with the intuitive truth that species were fixed objects created by design. Early support for Darwin's ideas came from the findings of field naturalists studying biogeography and ecology, including Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1860, and Asa Gray in 1862. Henry Walter Bates presented research in 1861 that explained insect mimicry using natural selection. Alfred Russel Wallace discussed evidence from his Malay archipelago research, including an 1864 paper with an evolutionary explanation for the Wallace line.","completion":"Lamarck gives the name and is credited today for proposing a theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. I've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini-series, \\"Planet Earth,\\" narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough. Nevertheless, whether it was screened down here in Australia or not, I never caught up with it, and when I happened upon the opportunity to see 'Earth (2007)'  a feature-length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen, I jumped at the chance. The theatre was basically empty; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me, and it was as though I had, not only the big screen to myself, but, indeed, the entire planet Earth. For 90 minutes, I was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness, amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film. Awesome in its scope, and yet painfully intimate at times, 'Earth' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet, and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction. Though the film, directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness, it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda, and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether; indeed, there is not a human in sight. Instead, we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world, to experience the resilience, and also the fragility, of life on Earth. I hear that the original mini-series, which ran for eleven episodes, delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems, but I think that, here, the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact: I can't remember the last time that I felt so inspired, and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time. By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals, anthropomorphising them to an extent, we are suddenly able to appreciate the \\"human side\\" of each species, and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy. 'Earth' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes, whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice, or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life-saving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta. The documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death, most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator-prey interactions. Though occasionally, perhaps to cater towards a younger audience, the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment, I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature, and the raw instinct that fuels these animals' final, hopeless efforts at survival. There's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt, both in the slow-motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey {the result of a single fateful misstep}, or the majestic mid-air leap of a Great White Shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion. It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species. Aside from these main stories, we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world, including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea, and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes. Of course, entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone, and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly. By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear, elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles, via some astonishing high-definition time-lapse photography, throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show, and only 90 minutes to show it. Consequently, 'Earth' left me thirsting for more, and, fortunately, I now have approximately eleven hours more, as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box-set for \\"Planet Earth.\\" Uplifting and tear-jerking, awe-inspiring and heartrending, 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience, and it might just be my favourite film of 2007. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"This review thought positively of the movie.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Metrosideros is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines mostly found in the Pacific region in the Myrtaceae family. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek \\"metra\\" or \\"heartwood\\" and \\"sideron\\" or \\"iron\\". Perhaps the best-known species are the phutukawa (\\"M. excelsa\\"), northern rt (\\"M. robusta\\"), and southern rt (\\"M. umbellata\\") of New Zealand, and \\"hia lehua\\", (\\"M. polymorpha\\"), from the Hawaiian Islands. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - Myrtaceae is the myrtle family, a family of dicotyledonous plants placed within the order Myrtales. Myrtle, pohutukawa, the bay rum tree, clove, guava, acca (feijoa), allspice, and eucalyptus all are members of this group. All species are woody, with essential oils, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. One notable character of the family is that the phloem is located on both sides of the xylem, not just outside as in most other plants. The leaves are evergreen, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually with an entire (not toothed) margin. The flowers have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The stamens are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured and numerous. - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Buenos Aires is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \\"Buenos aires\\" can be translated as \\"fair winds\\" or \\"good airs\\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \\"Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre\\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people, of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America, only larger in size than Suriname. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as \\"Corazón de Sudamérica\\" (\\"Heart of South America\\"). Paraguay is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Paraguay is the smallest landlocked country in the Americas. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - Metrosideros stipularis is a species of the myrtle family commonly known as tepú , trepú , or tepual . It is an evergreen tree or shrub that can attain a height of about seven metres . The plant is native to southern South America in the southern portions of Chile and Argentina and is a typical resident of very wet areas , especially peat bogs . Tepú has white flowers that emerge during the austral summer from January through March . The tree 's wood is used within its range as a firewood due to it high energy content . This species has often been placed in its own genus Tepualia , but recent works include it in Metrosideros \`\` WCSP '' . World Checklist of Selected Plant Families . . - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. What is the relationship between 'metrosideros stipularis' and 'myrtaceae'? Answer:","completion":"Metrosideros stipularis is a species of the genus Metrosideros, which belongs to the Myrtaceae family.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work. At one stage, William considered converting the palace into the new Houses of Parliament, after the destruction of the Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834.","completion":"From the context, King William IV is the brother who hired Edward Blore.

They are seeking clarification on how to say these words correctly. Step 2: Research how to pronounce the words 'venti' and 'Wanelo' I will search for the correct pronunciation of both terms and determine whether Starbucks' pronunciation of 'venti' is accurate. Step 3: Compare the questions After gathering information about the pronunciation of these words, I will compare the nature of the questions to determine if they are asking for the same thing. Step 4: Present the findings After doing the research, I found the following information: - 'Venti': The word 'venti' is typically pronounced as /'vɛnteɪ/ at Starbucks, and it is an Italian word that means 'twenty.' It refers to the size of the coffee, which is 20 ounces. The typical Starbucks pronunciation is close to the Italian pronunciation of /'vɛnti/ and is generally considered the correct way to pronounce it in the context of Starbucks. - 'Wanelo': Wanelo is pronounced as /wəˈniːloʊ/. It is the name of a shopping app and is short for \\"Want, Need, Love.\\" Now, comparing the questions, I can deduce that: - Both questions are asking about how to pronounce specific words. - Both questions are seeking pronunciation clarification but for different words.

Julie, an Australian housewife in Brisbane is one such example. Even though autumn is approaching Australia's Brisbane in April, one can still watch colorful blooming flowers in Julie's little garden, as she tells that in her community,\\"Each of us has a beautiful yard. The whole community, from children to elderly people, takes care of the environment as if they are taking care of their own garden.\\" \\"Gardening is the most popular club in our community,\\" she says. \\"A lot of retired people don't just regularly organize gardening lectures, but also personally visit families in the community to provide gardening training. So you can see that flowers continue to blossom in our gardens throughout the year.\\" Talking about her people's sense of caring for the environment, Julie says when people in the community take along their dog, they always carry a garbage bag to deal with the dog's waste. \\"In our community, you will never experience the embarrassment of stepping on the dirty waste while you are walking on the grass,\\" says Julie with a smile. \\"Taking care of the dog's waste can also help to develop children's sense of responsibility!\\" As to protecting water resources, the Australian government has made strict rules for families. Julie says, \\"We certainly would not use tap water to water the flowers!\\" She says almost every family in her community has a huge tank used to store rainwater, which is later used as the resource of all outdoor water use, including car washing and watering the garden. This year, they also asked people to connect the water tank with their toilets. Question: Why can flowers be seen all year round in Julie's community?

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies? from the following article ? Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.

Given the following context: The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area. They also have... answer the following question: What part of the eye is enlarged in the animal that are not thought to have a good sense of taste?

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the palazzo for which it was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that it was occupied on a permanent basis? The building was sold in 1549 by Buonaccorso Pitti, a descendant of Luca Pitti, to Eleonora di Toledo. Raised at the luxurious court of Naples, Eleonora was the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici of Tuscany, later the Grand Duke. On moving into the palace, Cosimo had Vasari enlarge the structure to fit his tastes; the palace was more than doubled by the addition of a new block along the rear. Vasari also built the Vasari Corridor, an above-ground walkway from Cosimo's old palace and the seat of government, the Palazzo Vecchio, through the Uffizi, above the Ponte Vecchio to the Palazzo Pitti. This enabled the Grand Duke and his family to move easily and safely from their official residence to the Palazzo Pitti. Initially the Palazzo Pitti was used mostly for lodging official guests and for occasional functions of the court, while the Medicis' principal residence remained the Palazzo Vecchio. It was not until the reign of Eleonora's son Francesco I and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo was occupied on a permanent basis and became home to the Medicis' art collection.Land on the Boboli hill at the rear of the palazzo was acquired in order to create a large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of the palazzo. The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.

It was during the reign of Francesco I de' Medici and his wife Johanna of Austria that the palazzo became their permanent residence and housed the Medici family's extensive collection of art.

Read this: As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles due to Rayleigh scattering, changing the final color of the beam that is seen. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye. At sunrise and sunset, when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon its red glow. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the effect on blue and green light experiencing Rayleigh scattering during sunrise?","completion":"During sunrise, the effect on blue and green light experiencing Rayleigh scattering is that these shorter wavelength colors are scattered more strongly and effectively removed from the direct sunlight that reaches an observer's eye. As the sun is low on the horizon during sunrise, sunlight passes through a greater thickness of the Earth's atmosphere, which contains air molecules and airborne particles. This increased path length leads to a higher probability of Rayleigh scattering taking place for shorter wavelength colors, such as blue and green. As a result, the sunlight that reaches the observer's eye predominantly consists of longer wavelength colors, like orange and red, creating the warm and reddish hues commonly associated with sunrises and sunsets. The scattered blue and green light contributes to the overall coloration of the sky but is not part of the direct sunlight perceived during these times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.","completion":"The Chicxulub crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s.

Among his most popular plays are All My Sons (1947), Death of a Salesman (1949), The Crucible (1953) and A View from the Bridge (1955, revised 1956). He also wrote several screenplays and was most noted for his work on The Misfits (1961). The drama Death of a Salesman has been numbered on the short list of finest American plays in the 20th century alongside Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night and Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire. In 1940, Miller married Mary Grace Slattery. The couple had two children, Jane and Robert (born May 31, 1947). Miller was exempted from military service during World War II because of a high school football injury to his left kneecap. That same year his first play was produced; The Man Who Had All the Luck won the Theatre Guild's National Award. The play closed after four performances with disastrous reviews. In 1947, Miller's play All My Sons, the writing of which had commenced in 1941, was a success on Broadway (earning him his first Tony Award, for Best Author) and his reputation as a playwright was established. Years later, in a 1994 interview with Ron Rifkin, Miller said that most contemporary critics regarded All My Sons as \\"a very depressing play in a time of great optimism\\" and that positive reviews from Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times had saved it from failure. In 1948, Miller built a small studio in Roxbury, Connecticut. There, in less than a day, he wrote Act I of Death of a Salesman. Within six weeks, he completed the rest of the play, one of the classics of world theater. Death of a Salesman premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred Dunnock as Linda, Arthur Kennedy as Biff, and Cameron Mitchell as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times. In 1949, Miller exchanged letters with Eugene O'Neill regarding Miller's production of All My Sons. O'Neill had sent Miller a congratulatory telegram; in response, he wrote a letter that consisted of a few paragraphs detailing his gratitude for the telegram, apologizing for not responding earlier, and inviting Eugene to the opening of Death of a Salesman. O'Neill replied, accepting the apology, but declining the invitation, explaining that his Parkinson's disease made it difficult to travel. He ended the letter with an invitation to Boston, a trip that never occurred.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: How did the play do?","completion":"The play Death of a Salesman did very well.

Write a summary based on this article: AT&T Inc. (T), joining the ranks of U.S. TV, Internet and wireless providers racing to consolidate, is in advanced talks to acquire DirecTV (DIG1) for about 50 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Under the plan being discussed, management of DirecTV, the largest U.S. satellite-TV provider, will continue to run the company as a unit of AT&T, said the people, asking not to be named because the information is private. DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White is likely to retire after 2015, the people said. The purchase would give AT&T a national satellite-TV provider to combine with its wireless, phone and high-speed broadband Internet services as competition ramps up. The pool of pay-TV customers is peaking in the U.S. because viewers are increasingly watching video online, and the combination would keep DirecTV from being on its own with just a TV offering and no competitive Internet package. “With DirecTV they are getting a national TV presence -- they can sell TV with wireless nationwide,” said Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics, based in Dedham, Massachusetts. “AT&T has increasingly been breaking out of their 22-state landline footprint. They sell wireless, they started selling home security and they could add TV to that package.” Photographer: Patrick T.

A price could come in close to 95 a share, depending on how much cash or stock is in the transaction, another person said. The person said White’s future after a merger is also still being negotiated. The price could go as high as 100 a share, two other people said. Cash-Stock The deal could be reached in the next couple of weeks while the sides negotiate the cash-stock component along with the size of the termination fee, said another person familiar with the matter. The termination fee is important because that payment would go to DirecTV from AT&T if the deal was blocked for various reasons, including by regulators on antitrust grounds. In AT&T’s failed effort to acquire Deutsche Telekom AG’s T-Mobile US unit in 2011, the company paid out 3 billion in cash plus wireless frequencies and a roaming agreement. AT&T fell 1 percent to 36.20 at the close in New York. DirecTV slipped 1.2 percent to 86.08, after gaining 26 percent this year through yesterday. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is one of the biggest beneficiaries of DirecTV’s rally, thanks to a stake built by his deputy stock pickers at about half the current price.

Latin America AT&T would be getting a pay-TV business that’s expanding in Latin America and generating higher monthly bills from U.S. customers. DirecTV’s exclusive content includes the National Football League Sunday Ticket package and products such as Genie, a multiroom digital video recorder. Comcast Corp.’s (CMCSA) plan to acquire Time Warner Cable (TWC) Inc. -- to create an even bigger provider of both TV and Internet in the U.S. -- is accelerating the drive for consolidation in the rest of the industry. In March, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson called the Time Warner Cable takeover an “industry-redefining deal.” The question with all of these potential tie-ups is whether regulators will allow them. Comcast’s takeover of Time Warner Cable hasn’t been approved yet. A merger of DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. (DISH) was blocked more than a decade ago, and AT&T had to abandon a purchase of T-Mobile several years ago in the face of antitrust opposition. Regulatory Approval DirecTV and AT&T are planning on a 12-month regulatory process to review the deal, one of the people said. “If regulators let Comcast buy Time Warner Cable, there’s no reason they wouldn’t let AT&T buy DirecTV,” Entner said. “They have to see it as part of a holistic market.” Getting ownership of DirecTV’s Latin American units would cause a conflict for AT&T, which holds an 8 percent stake in America Movil SAB (AMXL) -- a direct competitor to DirecTV in countries including Brazil and Colombia. DirecTV’s Latin America operation includes Mexico, where it has a minority stake in Sky Mexico, controlled by Grupo Televisa SAB, one of America Movil’s biggest rivals. DirecTV had also drawn merger interest from Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen, people with knowledge of the matter said in March. While a DirecTV merger is tempting, the satellite-TV rival is too expensive to pursue, Ergen said last week on a conference call to discuss first-quarter earnings. Debt Funding “If DTV is willing to sell for 100 then it must be either concerned about its lack of broadband long term, worried about the viability of a Dish merger, or both,” Philip Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a research note. Darris Gringeri, a DirecTV spokesman, declined to comment as did Brad Burns, an AT&T spokesman. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that AT&T is planning a stock and cash bid for DirecTV (DTV), without specifying the price. AT&T can afford to add about 16 billion in debt to fund the DirecTV deal without risking a credit-rating downgrade, according to Erich Marriott, an analyst with Bloomberg Industries. The company is rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service and A- at Standard & Poor’s, both four levels above junk. Adding 16 billion of debt would keep AT&T’s ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization below 2.5, the level at which credit ratings agencies have said may trigger a downgrade, Marriott wrote in a research note. The analysis assumes deal synergies of about 10 percent. That implies that AT&T will need to offer a significant portion of stock to fund the 50 billion acquisition. The company has about 3.6 billion of cash and near-cash items and two revolving credit agreements with a combined 8 billion available, according to a regulatory filing. “We were thinking AT&T would want to use as much debt as they can and that the deal could be all cash,” said John Hodulik, an analyst with UBS AG. “But that would mean the leverage would be about 2.7, and that’s too high. I think they’d prefer 2.5 leverage.” To contact the reporters on this story: Alex Sherman in New York at asherman6@bloomberg.net; Jeffrey McCracken in New York at jmccracken3@bloomberg.net To contact the editors responsible for this story: Mohammed Hadi at mhadi1@bloomberg.net; Sarah Rabil at srabil@bloomberg.net Sarah Rabil ||||| Photo AT&T is in talks to buy DirecTV for at least 50 billion, and the two sides are actively working toward an announcement, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. If completed, a deal would give AT&T, the country’s second-largest wireless carrier, control of the country’s largest satellite television provider, further reshaping the rapidly changing telecommunications and television industries. AT&T has grown interested in DirecTV in recent months, according to several people with knowledge of the company’s thinking, leading to an approach in the last few weeks. Rumors of a deal between the two companies have sent DirecTV shares up about 12 percent this month. On Monday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that talks had accelerated, details on the timing and the price of a deal began coming into focus. The terms of any agreement are not expected to be released in the next two weeks, and the two sides are working on a pricing structure under which AT&T would pay 92 to 94 a share. In addition, Mike White, DirecTV’s chief executive, is not expected to step down if the deal goes through. DirecTV closed at 87.16 on Monday, but was up sharply in after-hours trading. For AT&T, a deal for DirecTV would signal its continued ambitions to grow in the United States, after its attempted takeover of the rival wireless carrier T-Mobile failed in 2011 because of resistance from regulators. This year, AT&T was looking to expand in Europe and considering an acquisition of Vodafone, which sold its stake in Verizon Wireless back to Verizon Communications for 130 billion in February. But AT&T has refocused its attention on the United States market, believing it has an opportunity to expand its footprint in the pay-television business. DirecTV has about 20 million subscribers in the United States. Talks between AT&T and DirecTV began in earnest after Comcast announced its plan to acquire Time Warner Cable. That deal, if completed, would create a clear leader in the cable television industry. Photo People knowledgeable about both deals said that if AT&T and DirecTV announced a merger, it could complicate the review of Comcast’s bid for Time Warner Cable, because antitrust regulators might want to consider both deals simultaneously. By acquiring DirecTV, AT&T could bolster its small television operations and gain a valuable foothold in Latin America, where DirecTV has about 18 million subscribers. But several people in the industry said they believed that the ideal target for AT&T would be not DirecTV but its main competitor, Dish Network. Dish, run by the billionaire Charles W. Ergen, has amassed a trove of spectrum that could be valuable to AT&T as it seeks to build out its wireless network. Some investment bankers privately speculated that talks between AT&T and DirecTV were intended to draw Mr. Ergen off the sidelines and into the fray. But last week, speaking in a conference call after announcing first-quarter earnings, Mr. Ergen said his company was not in a position to make an offer for DirecTV. “DirecTV would be too frothy for us, for our board to look at, at those kinds of prices,” he said. Photo AT&T is facing renewed competition in the wireless market. Verizon has taken full control of Verizon Wireless, giving it access to additional cash. And Sprint, the third-largest wireless provider, has struck a deal with Japan’s SoftBank that will give it added firepower as it seeks to expand. Another deal on the horizon could be Sprint’s making an offer for T-Mobile, the fourth-largest wireless carrier, which is just completing its own major purchase. Last year, T-Mobile acquired MetroPCS. People briefed on the discussions between AT&T and DirecTV said there was no guarantee that a deal would be completed. AT&T and DirecTV declined to comment. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting. ||||| NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES AT&T; Inc is in active talks to buy satellite TV provider DirecTV and may complete a deal in the next few weeks that could be worth close to 50 billion, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The second-largest wireless operator is discussing an offer in the low- to mid-90s per share for DirecTV, one of the people said, compared with the company's closing price of 87.16 on Monday. A bid near 95 per share would value DirecTV at more than 48 billion based on its shares outstanding, and would represent a premium of more than 20 percent to its stock price before news of AT&T;'s interest first emerged on May 1. The deal price has yet to be finalized and terms could still change, the people said, adding that discussions are continuing. They asked not to be named because the matter is not public. Other details also have yet to be worked out, such as a break-up fee as well as a potential role for DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Mike White, the second person said. The talks are the latest sign of a rising tide of potential megadeals in the telecoms, cable and satellite TV space, which is being roiled by Comcast Corp's proposed 45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable Inc as well as market forces such as the rise of Web-based TV and surging mobile Internet usage. AT&T; and DirecTV declined to comment. Bloomberg News earlier reported that AT&T; was offering to pay around 100 per share for DirecTV, whose management team will continue to run the company as a unit of AT&T.; (link.reuters.com/xyf39v). The Wall Street Journal said a deal could happen in two weeks. DirecTV shares rose 6 percent to 92.50 in extended trading on Monday. DirecTV is working with advisers including Goldman Sachs Group to evaluate a possible combination following a recent takeover approach from AT&T;, Reuters reported last week. A combination of AT&T; and DirecTV would create a pay television giant close in size to where Comcast will be if it completes its pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable. For that reason, the proposed merger is likely to face a prolonged battle to convince regulators to allow further consolidation in pay-TV. \\"This is not the first time that AT&T; and DirecTV have danced around the fire and thought if they could give it a go,\\" said ReconAnalytics analyst Roger Entner. \\"They both looked at each other for at least 10 years. Both kind of came to the conclusion that it was in the right environment. It makes a lot of sense to get together, but there was never the right regulatory environment for it.\\" A Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would call for a counterweight like a combined AT&T-DirecTV;, Entner said. He added that the merger would make sense for DirecTV given the decline of satellite TV. \\"They both see the Grim Reaper at the horizon. DirecTV hasn't gone out and bought spectrum. Dish has, so DirecTV needs to find a partner, and AT&T; is that partner,\\" he said. Some investors have also speculated about a potential tie-up of DirectTV and smaller rival Dish Network Corp. But Dish Chairman Charlie Ergen last week said his company, which attempted to buy DirecTV more than a decade ago, would not make a fresh approach at current prices even though he said such a tie-up would create many benefits.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I can use this background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. Now, I have a new situation: Two sisters took their blood pressure at the doctor's office. Jill had hypertension, while her sister Beth had normal blood pressure. Answer this question please: Which sister has to make diet changes? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided background information, Jill, the sister with hypertension, is the one who needs to make diet changes. Since hypertension is a condition characterized by consistently high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure of 140 or higher and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90 or higher), it can lead to an increased risk of developing heart disease, stroke, or other serious cardiovascular issues. As hypertension is often asymptomatic and referred to as the \\"silent killer,\\" it is crucial for individuals diagnosed with the condition to take necessary steps to manage and reduce their blood pressure. One of the primary interventions for high blood pressure is making changes to one's diet. By incorporating foods that are believed to help lower blood pressure, such as skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas, and dark chocolate, Jill can improve her blood pressure levels and reduce her risk of developing cardiovascular complications. In addition to dietary changes, it would be beneficial for Jill to engage in regular exercise and, if needed, take prescribed medication as advised by her healthcare professional. On the other hand, Beth, who has normal blood pressure, might not need to make any significant dietary changes. However, maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring her blood pressure would be good preventive measures for her to ensure continued cardiovascular health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: Mars Inc., the privately held maker of Uncle Ben’s Rice and packaged meals, is calling on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue voluntary guidelines for how much salt should be in processed food. The announcement is the first of its kind by a foodmaker in the U.S. It comes as Mars Food, the company’s Brussels-based packaged-food division, vows to reduce the amount of sodium in its products by an average of 20 percent by 2021. Mars also said each jar of its tomato-based products will have at least one serving of vegetables and that it plans to cut added sugar in a “limited number of sauces and light meals” over the next two years. The FDA is working on salt guidelines for processed food that are expected to be released in coming months, and Mars Food wanted to weigh in on the issue, said Fiona Dawson, the division’s global president. “It’s the right time to engage in the debate,” Dawson said Wednesday in an interview. “We see the industry moving really well when we have voluntary guidelines.” Mars had net sales of 33 billion last year, making it one of the world’s largest foodmakers. The current initiative is limited to Mars Food, which doesn’t include its popular candy products such as M&M’s and Snickers. The food division, which counts the U.S. and U.K. as its top markets, is retooling products to meet sugar and salt guidelines established by the World Health Organization. Other companies are also taking steps to curb salt in their products. General Mills Inc. said in December that it had cut the amount of sodium in 10 product categories, including pizza and cereal, by at least 18 percent. Nestle SA, Hormel Foods Corp., and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., -- the biggest grocery seller in the U.S. -- are among the companies that have also reduced salt in their products. ‘Deadliest Ingredient’ An Obama administration plan to push food companies to reduce salt has been stalled for several years. Recent reports have indicated that voluntary guidelines could be released early this summer. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, which calls sodium “perhaps the deadliest ingredient in our food supply,” sued the FDA in October to force the agency to issue mandatory salt-reduction targets. The FDA is expected to respond to the lawsuit by June 15, according to CSPI. The advocacy group had originally filed a citizens petition in 2005 calling for the FDA to take action on salt limits and sued after waiting 10 years for a response, a spokesman said. Issuing voluntary guidelines for salt reduction could be the FDA’s response to the lawsuit, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Mars Food expects that whatever happens in the U.S., using the WHO standards will put the company ahead of the curve. “We’ve looked across the globe, and we think we’ll be ahead of local guidelines,” Dawson said. ||||| Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Dolmio's carbonara, along with lasagne sauces, pesto, and macaroni oven kits, are all on the list The company behind Dolmio and Uncle Ben's sauces says some products should only be consumed once a week due to high salt, sugar or fat content. Mars Food said it would distinguish between \\"everyday\\" and \\"occasional\\" items on packs and website. The company said some foods were higher in salt, sugar or fat to maintain the \\"authentic\\" taste of products. The National Obesity Forum described the move as \\"hugely unusual\\" but \\"very imaginative\\". The advice is part of Mars's Health and Wellbeing Ambition to \\"create and promote healthier food choices\\". These include Dolmio lasagne sauces, pesto, and carbonara and macaroni oven kits, and Uncle Ben's oriental sauces. How much sugar is hiding in your food? Are we being fooled by food labels? How much is too much salt? Mars said its website would be updated over the next few months with the list of products to be eaten not more than once a week, and \\"everyday\\" ones. A spokeswoman for Mars said that the company considered all of the ingredients that would go into making a complete meal using the product, rather than just for example the sauce itself, when deciding which products were to be classed as being for \\"occasional\\" or \\"everyday\\" consumption. Adults are recommended to have 70g fat a day, 20g saturated fat, 90g sugar and 6g salt. per day. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, a charity that raises awareness about the condition, said: \\"Mars signposted their direction of travel towards healthier products several years ago and are now putting their money where their mouth is.\\" Ben Reynolds, deputy co-ordinator of food and farming alliance Sustain, said he believed companies were \\"trying to scramble to show they can be good and do the right thing\\" before the government releases its childhood obesity strategy later this year. \\"The government have shown they are willing to bare their teeth and they're not going to stand for a voluntary approach,\\" he said. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Victoria Derbyshire programme looks at products affected and hears from healthy eating campaigner Jenny Rosborough from Action on Sugar Speaking to the BBC News channel, he welcomed the move and called for other businesses to follow suit. He added: \\"The truth of it is that anything that comes out of a packet, comes out of a jar, that has been processed, is not going to be particularly healthy for you. \\"Whether you're making a quick pasta meal or a Sunday roast, the cheapest and healthiest way is from fresh ingredients.\\" Nutritionist Jenny Rosborough from Action on Sugar told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: \\"It's great that they are pushing forward this responsible labelling and raising awareness. \\"But the challenge we have with it is that only the health conscious will look at the labels in the first place, therefore it's not going to hit the people who need it the most.\\" Analysis Image copyright Thinkstock By Helen Briggs, BBC News Whose responsibility is it to make sure we eat healthy food and shouldn't the sugar tax apply to all foods, not just soft drinks? These are some of the questions being asked following the announcement by Mars that some of its products - such as pasta sauces and pesto - should be eaten only occasionally. A tax on sugary soft drinks will take effect in two years' time - giving food manufacturers a nudge towards cutting sugar. But in the food sector the government relies on industry to self-regulate. According to campaign group Campaign for Action on Salt reformulation is key, but while it remains voluntary many companies are failing to do this. One of the UK's leading nutrition experts, Prof Tom Sanders, says the Mars move sounds like \\"Martian spin\\" as there's no need to add large amounts of salt to cook-in sauces - and these foods should be everyday foods not treats. Mars said the products the advice applies to are to be reformulated over the next five years to cut salt, sugar or fat. Nutritionist Laura De La Harpe told BBC Radio 5 live it should not be difficult to reduce the sugar content. \\"What would concern me would be if they start adding sweeteners, artificial sweeteners to replace the sugar,\\" she said. Mars said its \\"nutrition criteria\\" has been developed based on recommendations from leading public health authorities such as the World Health Organization. Fiona Dawson, a global president of Mars, said: \\"We're holding ourselves to a much higher standard... which will lead us to further reducing sodium across our global product portfolio by an average of 20% by 2021 and added sugar in a limited number of sauces and light meals by 2018. \\"While we have some work to do, 70% of our tomato-based Dolmio jar products already meet this 'everyday' standard. \\"Our guidance to consumers on everyday and occasional meals is a key element of our ambition, as 95% of our product portfolio will fall into the 'everyday' category and 5% of our product portfolio will receive an 'occasional' label in the coming years, much of which will still go through some amount of reformulation to be made healthier.\\" The move comes after Chancellor George Osborne announced a sugar tax, with the aim of tackling childhood obesity, in his recent Budget. ||||| LONDON (Reuters) - Mars Food plans to tell customers to eat some of its Dolmio pasta sauces and macaroni cheese only once a week to maintain a balanced diet because of the products’ high levels of salt, sugar or fat. Dolmio pasta sauces are seen in a store in in London, Britain April 15, 2016. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth The scheme is part of a larger initiative by the privately owned U.S. food company to encourage healthier eating at a time when large food multinationals, or Big Food, are coming under increasing pressure from public health advocates and regulators struggling to fight a growing obesity epidemic. The plan, however, does not extend to Mars’ chocolate or sweets businesses, whose brands include M&M;’s, Snickers and Starburst. Products that are particularly high in salt, sugar or fat, including Dolmio lasagne meal kits and lasagne sauces, will come with a label advising “occasional” consumption, meaning once a week. Products with lower levels of salt, sugar or fat will be considered “everyday” products. The company said most of its products in the UK would fall into the latter category. However, only 70 percent of its tomato sauces sold in jars already meet that standard. It did not give details for other countries but plans to introduce the labeling in all markets where those products are sold. Nearly all packaged food makers are reformulating products as they try to keep up with changing tastes of increasingly health-conscious consumers. Mars Food, which also produces Uncle Ben’s rice, said it plans to post on its website within the next few months a list of “occasional” products, and “everyday” products, including ones to be reformulated over the next five years to reduce sodium, sugar or fat. It has also set targets to reduce sodium across its global product range by an average of 20 percent by 2021, and cut the amount of added sugar in a limited number of sauces and light meals by 2018. It also plans to boost the use of whole grains and vegetables. Some countries including Britain, France and Mexico have announced levies on sugar-sweetened drinks, while others are considering them. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Mars Food plans to introduce food labelling that distinguishes between what it calls “everyday” and “occasional” products.

Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.\\" Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.The tour, however, was notable for several incidents. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and his guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates. The European leg of the Damage, Inc.

Movie plot: Hatari!The film opens before the credits with the members of the Momella Game Ltd. parked on the African plains scanning the landscape for rhino. Sean Mercer (John Wayne) spots one and moves out with his men to capture it. During the chase which ensues, Little Wolf, the Indian (Bruce Cabot), is gored in the leg and the rhino escapes. Kurt (Hardy Krüger), who was driving the herding jeep, blames himself for the mishap, despite what Sean says, as he feels he was herding too close. Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate. When a young Frenchman with a chip on his shoulder named Charles Maurey (Gérard Blain) comes up to them and asks Sean for the Indian's job, as he was afraid if he waited someone else would get it, the party reacts with indignation and Kurt knocks him down in anger. Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian. He sadly relates to them that the Indian needs a transfusion, but his blood type AB negative is very difficult to match, and the plasma is not doing the job. The Frenchman announces that his blood type is the same as the Indian's, but he will only give it if Kurt asks him. Kurt does, and Sean tells the Frenchman to come out to the compound afterwards, and they'll see about that job. The doctor asks them all to leave the hospital as they're only in the way.The party relocates to a bar where some time and several drinks later the doctor calls to inform them the Indian will be all right and should soon be on...

Kim had a simple life filled with modest pleasures. She was a talented artist, and her paintings were what made her truly exceptional. Despite her talent, she never sought fame or fortune; rather, she painted only to express her truest self and emotions. Kim's paintings were vibrant and captivating, filled with emotion that poured from her fingertips. The townspeople admired her unique talent, but her creations never ventured far from her humble studio. Her works were known only to her and the handful of people who quietly appreciated her gift. One day, a traveling businessman named Jasper stumbled upon Brooksville while seeking a respite from the exhaustive demands of his job. He was captivated by the quaint, idyllic atmosphere of the town and, intrigued by the whispers about Kim's paintings, sought out her studio. Kim was initially hesitant to let Jasper into her sanctuary, but ultimately, she could not resist sharing her passion. As he marveled at her paintings, he couldn't believe that someone with her undeniable gifts had remained unknown and overlooked. As Jasper's visit to her studio drew to a close, he made a deal with Kim: he would showcase her art at a prestigious art gallery in the city, and in return, she would paint something special for him, capturing the essence of Brooksville. Kim accepted the terms, and over the next few months, she painted a magnificent piece that depicted the charm and serenity of her hometown. Jasper, true to his promise, arranged for her work to be displayed in one of the city's finest galleries, and Kim's life was forever changed. The night of the gallery opening, Kim, outfitted in her one elegant dress, nervously stood near her work, unsure if sophisticated city dwellers would appreciate her art. As guests streamed in and explored the exhibit, it wasn't long before a hushed awe began to fill the space around her painting. Art critics and collectors alike were entranced by the vivid colors and raw emotions embedded in her piece. Word of Kim's unique flair spread like wildfire, and her art career took off overnight. Overwhelmed by the attention and unsure how to handle her newfound fame, Kim retreated to Brooksville and her little studio. There, she found solace in the familiar surroundings, rediscovering her love for painting and the truth in her creations, which transcended the need for recognition. One day, while walking through the town, Kim noticed something curious – more and more people in Brooksville were taking up painting. Budding artists appeared all around the town, each entering a beautiful world of self-expression and color. They confided in Kim that her story of talent and passion emerging from humble beginnings had spurred the transformation. The townspeople celebrated their newfound love for art and formed an art community, complete with exhibitions, workshops, and even a local art festival. Kim understood then that her paintings and her refusal to let go of her roots had touched something deep within the souls of her friend and neighbors. She eventually embraced her role as a mentor in the art community, helping others discover their own creative voices. And, as she watched her once quiet town transform into a thriving hub brimming with artists honing their skills, Kim was glad people were inspired to imitate her."},{"prompt":"Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: The world is very big, it has many countries and continents on it's spherical surface.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). Paragraph: Two soccer players had a friendly match one on one after work.

With an expenditure of around £3 million, new facilities are to be improved at Glangwili, Carmarthen, alongside a fresh midwife-led unit that is scheduled at Withybush. The changes are set to initiate from 4 August. Public protests have been spurred by these plans. In particular, the local patient watch group expressed apprehensions over transferring the special care baby unit from Haverfordwest to Carmarthen, indicating that such a move could pose risks to lives. This led to hundreds of protesters gathering for a demonstration outside the Senedd in the previous month. Meetings were held last week to update the staff on the progression of these developments. While the consultation concluded in May, the health board of Hywel Dda asserted that the care received by mothers would still be secure and safe. According to a Hywel Dda health board spokesperson, the construction work remains on schedule, however, the beginning of the construction for the midwife-led unit at Withybush will not commence until the obstetric services have been transferred to Glangwili in order to lessen disruptions. Changes in the paediatric services are expected to happen in October. The spokesperson further clarified that, after several meetings with senior paediatric clinical staff, it has become evident that safe movement of the service by the start of August is not feasible due to recruitment timelines. He stressed the significance of safety in executing these changes and confirmed that alterations concerning paediatric services in Glangwili and Withybush Hospitals will consequently occur in October rather than simultaneously with the changes in maternity and neonatal services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Who will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","completion":"Kenny will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm. Steps and justification: 1. Bobby has increased the use of fertilizer due to the large order of potatoes: Increasing the use of fertilizer means more nitrogen and other elements are being added to the soil. When rain falls, these elements are dissolved and can be carried off by the runoff. 2. Kenny's use of fertilizer is currently low because tomatoes are not in season: With less fertilizer being used, fewer nutrients are being added to the soil. Therefore, less nutrients are available to be carried off by the runoff when it rains. 3. The rain falls on both farms: this means there is a mechanism to dissolve the fertilizers and transport them to the nearby bodies of water. 4. Given the above information, Bobby's farm, with the increased use of fertilizers, would likely contribute more to the nutrients (including nitrogen) ending up in the ponds. In comparison, Kenny, who is using less fertilizer, would contribute less. Hence, Kenny causes less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In addition, she ensured she was drinking enough water to stay hydrated. Allie learned how to monitor her portion sizes and make healthier food choices, while still allowing herself some occasional indulgences in moderation. To complement her improved dietary habits, Allie dedicated herself to a regular exercise routine. She knew variety would be key to avoiding boredom, so she incorporated different types of physical activities into her workout schedule. She started with brisk walking and jogging and gradually worked her way up to running. Allie also tried various group fitness classes, such as Zumba and yoga, to keep her engaged and excited about moving her body. One day her friend suggested she try weight lifting. Allie was initially hesitant, fearing she might bulk up, but her friend assured her that building strength would improve her overall fitness level and aid her weight-loss journey.

Not only was she shedding the pounds, but also gaining strength and confidence. People around her noticed her transformation too, which further fueled her motivation. They congratulated her on her achievements and often asked for advice on how they could embark on their weight-loss journeys too.

Now settled into Warner Bros. Records, the Chili Peppers began looking for a suitable producer. One in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded than people the band had worked with in the past, even though Rubin had turned down the chance to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak (who would die of a heroin overdose a year later). Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone the band felt confident in to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.The band sought to record the album in an unconventional setting, believing it would enhance their creative output. Rubin suggested the mansion magician Harry Houdini once lived in, to which they agreed. A crew was hired to set up a recording studio and other equipment required for production in the house in Los Angeles. The Peppers decided they would remain inside the mansion for the duration of recording, though according to Kiedis, Smith was convinced the location was haunted, and refused to stay. He would, instead, come each day by motorcycle. Smith himself disputes this account, and instead claims the real reason he did not stay at The Mansion was because he wanted to be with his wife.

Hypothesis: Big Sky is a CDP","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis that Big Sky is a Census-Designated Place (CDP) is true. According to the paragraph, Big Sky is a CDP located in Gallatin and Madison counties in southwestern Montana. A CDP is a term used by the United States Census Bureau to designate an unincorporated community that is identified by a defined region for statistical purposes. This means that Big Sky is not recognized as a town or city and does not have its own municipal government. The population of Big Sky was stated as 2,308 people according to the 2010 census. This information further supports the hypothesis assertion that Big Sky is indeed a Census-Designated Place, as the United States Census Bureau collects demographic data for CDPs during census counting. Furthermore, the paragraph states that the community is located 45 miles southwest of Bozeman, which serves as a geographical location identifier. Also, we can learn from the paragraph that the primary industry in Big Sky is tourism, which provides an insight into the socio-economic dynamic of the area. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis that Big Sky is a Census-Designated Place is true as it is explicitly stated to be a CDP, located in Gallatin and Madison counties in southwestern Montana, without its own government or incorporation as a town.

The given scenario, \\"A jockey in a purple uniform is riding a dark brown horse on the highway,\\" contains elements that are both consistent and inconsistent with the original premise. To determine the truth of the first premise according to the second scenario, we must compare each element. 1. A jockey in a purple uniform: Both the original premise and the given scenario describe a jockey wearing a purple uniform. This element is consistent between the two cases. 2. Riding a dark brown horse: Both the original premise and the given scenario involve a jockey riding a dark brown horse. This element is also consistent between the two cases. 3. On a field vs. on the highway: The original premise mentions that the jockey is riding their horse on a field, while the given scenario places them on a highway. These descriptions are inconsistent with one another. Fields and highways are distinct environments, and one cannot simultaneously exist as the other. A field usually refers to an open area of land, often used for agricultural purposes or as a space for sports and leisure activities. A highway, on the other hand, is a roadway designed for high-speed vehicular traffic that connects cities, towns, or other locales. Based on these comparisons, we can conclude that the premise \\"A jockey in a purple uniform is riding a dark brown horse on a field\\" is not true if \\"A jockey in a purple uniform is riding a dark brown horse on the highway.\\" While some aspects of the descriptions align, the primary issue lies in the inconsistency between the location descriptors.

Tumors, also known as neoplasms, are abnormal growths of cells that can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). While the choices provided mention white blood cells, consumption cells, and Boyle cells, these do not specifically make up tumors. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are the primary components of tumors. They originate from normal cells that have undergone a transformation due to genetic mutations or damage, which allows them to proliferate uncontrollably and form a mass of cells called a tumor. As these cancer cells continue to divide, they can invade nearby tissues and spread throughout the body through the blood or lymphatic system, a process known as metastasis. Cancer cells are unique in their ability to bypass the typical regulatory mechanisms that control healthy cell growth and division. This uncontrolled growth is what defines their malignant nature and poses a threat to the health of the individual.

Law of Universal Gravitation: This law, also developed by Isaac Newton, states that any two objects with mass will attract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. 3. Laws of Thermodynamics: These laws describe the fundamental principles governing the behavior of energy in closed systems. The First Law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. The Second Law states that entropy, or disorder, in a closed system will always increase in any spontaneous process.

Answer the following question: Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth. Question: suppose the liver turns more glucagon into glucose happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"The liver turning more glucagon into glucose doesn't directly impact the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. The process described about the bronchial tubes, lungs, and bloodstream carrying oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide is mainly about the respiratory system, not the digestive system or endocrine system that the glucagon-glucose process is part of. Glucagon is a hormone released by the pancreas when blood glucose levels are low. It stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream to maintain the body's glucose (blood sugar) levels. This process is known as glycogenolysis. Oxygen delivery to the bloodstream is mainly about a person's respiratory function, the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively, and the body's hematologic status (the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen). Converting more glucagon into glucose could potentially increase metabolic activities as cells have more fuel (in the form of glucose) to burn, leading to a higher demand and use of oxygen. But, this doesn't mean that more oxygen would be delivered to the bloodstream. The oxygen supply is contingent on the respiratory functions as well as cardiac output, not directly on glucose levels in the blood. If more glucose is available, cells will increase their metabolic activity, hence would require more oxygen for oxidative metabolism. However, the amount of glucose does not directly determine the amount of oxygen being transported in the blood or the body's ability to uptake this oxygen. So, strictly speaking, the given scenario would have \\"C: no effect\\" on a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. However, we need to mention that this is a highly generalized answer because various factors can prominently influence the oxygen-glucose dynamics, including individual's health status, type of metabolic activities being undertaken, efficiency of gas exchange in the lungs, etc. Therefore, this answer may differ in specific medical or physiological scenarios."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece.

His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy.

Its economy relies on fishing, olive oil and tourism. - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423 348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years. - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation. - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf. - Gytheio, the ancient Gythium or Gytheion, is a town and a former municipality in Laconia, Peloponnese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality East Mani, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 197.313 km. It was the seaport of Sparta, some north. Gytheio used to be an important port until it was destroyed in 4th century AD, possibly by an earthquake. Today it is the largest and most important town in Mani. It is also the seat of the municipality of East Mani. - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570 c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

The question is specifically about the religion of naturalists working at the two English universities. This information is not provided in the mentioned statement. To answer this question, one would have to look into the historical context of naturalists at the two English universities during the time period in question. It is worth noting that the Church of England was the dominant religious institution in England during the 19th century, and it is likely to assume that many scholars and naturalists might have been affiliated with it.

Given this situation, the most probable answer to your question is Option [II] Tired. When a person experiences a significant lack of sleep, the body and mind undergo considerable stress. Not getting enough sleep can have several negative impacts on both physical and mental well-being. Here are some of the possible effects: 1. Physical fatigue: Insufficient rest can lead to a persistent sense of tiredness or fatigue. It can cause a decrease in your energy levels, making it difficult to concentrate, stay alert, and perform daily tasks effectively. 2. Decreased cognitive function: Sleep is crucial for cognitive processes, including learning, memory, attention, decision-making, and problem-solving. As a result, the lack of sleep can lead to a decline in cognitive performance, negatively affecting work or school performance. 3. Emotional effects: Inadequate sleep may result in heightened emotions, mood swings, irritability, and lower tolerance to stress. Furthermore, chronic sleep deprivation can contribute to feelings of anxiety and depression. 4. Weakened immune system: Sleep is essential for maintaining a healthy immune system. Without proper rest, the body becomes more vulnerable to illness and infection. 5. Impaired coordination and motor skills: Inadequate sleep may lead to reductions in coordination, balance, and motor skills, increasing the risk of accidents and making it dangerous to perform tasks that require concentration and physical precision. While Option [III] Anxious and Option [IV] Depressed can be potential consequences of long-term sleep deprivation, the context provided in the text suggests that your primary feeling at the moment would be tiredness or fatigue. Nonetheless, it is essential to address the issue of sleep deprivation to avoid experiencing further adverse effects on your physical and mental health.

The song became Chaka Khan's biggest hit, earning her a Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance in 1985. Prince's original version had an upbeat pop-funk sound with romantic and sensual lyrics expressing the singer's intense feelings for the object of their affection.

Chaka Khan's version of \\"I Feel for You\\" starts with a memorable and innovative rap section performed by Melle Mel, a prominent rapper from the hip-hop group Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. This rap section added a fresh dimension to the song and was a perfect way to bridge the gap between pop and hip-hop during a time when these genres were just starting to merge. Furthermore, the legendary Stevie Wonder provided the harmonica solos throughout the song, enriching the overall texture and feel. The 1984 release of \\"I Feel for You\\" not only became a significant milestone for Chaka Khan, but it was also a turning point for Prince.

These scientific breakthroughs have not only led to life-saving medical technologies but also have fostered a strong power in Wisconsin economy. Across America, groundbreaking research supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) alone adds millions of dollars to our economy every year. In fact, NIH funding generated an estimated 58 billion in economic output nationwide in 2014. NIH funding spurs economic growth by supporting jobs in research and by generating biomedical innovations that are turned into new products. NIH-supported innovations also influence improvements in health that can bolster the economy, improve productivity, and reduce illness and disability at home and across the globe.

The Blockheads are an English rock and roll band. Originally fronted by lead singer Ian Dury as Ian Dury and the Blockheads, the band has continued to perform since Dury's death in 2000. Current members include Derek Hussey (vocals), Chaz Jankel (keyboards and guitar), Norman Watt-Roy (bass), Mick Gallagher (keyboards and piano), John Turnbull (vocals and guitar) and John Roberts (drums). There is rolling line-up of saxophonists that includes Gilad Atzmon, Terry Edwards or Dave Lewis and from time to time, the original sax player, Davey Payne. In 1974 Radio Caroline's Ronan O'Rahilly set up the pop group The Loving Awareness Band, comprising John Turnbull (guitar) and Mick Gallagher (keyboards) both formerly of 1960s psychedelic rock band Skip Bifferty with the session musicians Norman Watt-Roy (bass) and Charlie Charles (born Hugh Glenn Mortimer Charles, Guyana 1945) (drums). In 1976 The Loving Awareness Band released their only album, Loving Awareness (ML001), on O'Rahilly's label More Love Records. The album has appeared on CD more than once, although these reissues have been sourced from a mint vinyl pressing rather than from the original master tapes. The Loving Awareness Band broke up in 1977 and Watt-Roy and Charles joined a new band being formed by Ian Dury, who had begun writing songs with pianist and guitarist Chaz Jankel (the brother of noted music video, TV, commercial and film director Annabel Jankel). With Jankel fashioning Dury's lyrics into number of songs, the two began recording with Charles, Watt-Roy, Gallagher, Turnbull and former Kilburn and the High Roads saxophonist Davey Payne. An album was recorded, but was of no interest to major record labels. Next door to Dury's manager's office, however, was the newly formed Stiff Records, a perfect home for Dury's maverick style.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Where does the publisher's niece meet with Donna's fiance after his call? , can you please find it? Donna Foster works for publisher John Caine. She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine. A romance develops that leads to Christabel marrying Curtis and becoming a high society lady. However, it turns out that she is still attracted to Nick, whom she begins seeing on the side. On one occasion, she slips away from a vacation resort, telling Curtis that she is going to see her aunt Clara. Her lie is exposed by Caine, her uncle, who informs Curtis that the aunt had died while Christabel claimed to be visiting her. Curtis reunites with Donna after sending away Christabel with nothing more than a few expensive furs. She gets into an accident and is hospitalized, but promptly begins a flirtation with her doctor, showing that she is truly incorrigible.","completion":"In the article, the publisher's niece, Christabel, meets with Donna's fiance, Curtis Carey, at a jeweler after receiving a call from him."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You will be given a text in Russian language which contain different emotion labels from the list - ['joy', ' sadness', 'surprise', 'fear', 'anger'].

Problem:Article: The case for college has been accepted without question for more than a generation. All high school graduates ought to go, because college will help them earn more money, become \\"better\\" people, and learn to be more responsible citizens than those who don't go. But college has never been able to work its magic for everyone. And now that close to half our high school graduates are attending, those who don't fit the pattern are becoming more and more, and more obvious. College graduates are selling shoes and driving taxis; college students get in the way of each other's experiments and write false letters of recommendation in the competition for admission to graduate school. Others find no interest in their studies, and drop out -often encouraged by college administrators. Some observers say the fault is with the young people themselves--they are spoiled and they are expecting too much. But that is a condemnation of the students as a whole, and does not explain all campus unhappiness. Others blame the state of the world, and they are partly right. We've been told that young people have to go to college because our economy cannot take in an army of untrained 18 year-olds. But disappointed graduates are learning that it can no longer take in an army of trained 22-year-olds, either. Some adventuresome educators and campus watchers have openly begun to suggest that college may not be the best, the proper, the only place for every young person after the completion of high school. _ Perhaps college does not make people intelligent(clever), ambitious, happy, liberal, or quick to learn things--maybe it is just the other way round, and intelligent, ambitious, happy, liberal, quick-learning people are only the ones who have been attracted to college in the first place. And perhaps all those successful college graduates would have been successful whether they had gone to college or not. This is heresy to those of us who have been brought up to believe that if little schooling is good, more has to be much better. But opposite evidence is beginning to mount up. Question: According to the passage all of the following statements are true EXCEPT _ . Options: (A) about half of the high school graduates continue their studies at school (B) college graduates are believed to be able to earn more money (C) administrators often encourage college students to drop out (D) more and more young people are found unfit for college.

Which language is this?","completion":"This sentence is in Czech, which is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, and both languages were at one point in history considered \\"Czechoslovak\\" when the two countries were united. Czech uses the Latin alphabet with added diacritics such as the háček (ˇ) and kroužek (˚) to denote specific pronunciation features of certain consonant and vowel characters. The given sentence translates to \\"Elli, you are a genius!\\" in English. Here, \\"Elli\\" refers to a name or informal title, typically in a friendly and familiar context. Czech grammar tends to place the verb at the end of the sentence, which might seem unusual to English speakers. In general, Czech grammar follows a complex, inflected structure with seven cases for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives, and four tenses for verbs. It also has three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), and the gender of a noun significantly affects the grammar of the phrases and sentences in which the noun appears. Czech vocabulary is extensive, encompassing a wide range of subject areas and idiomatic expressions. As with other Slavic languages, Czech has a rich array of consonant clusters and distinctive vowel sounds.

Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power. Which country used more radioactive elements? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Greece used more radioactive elements in producing their electricity since they relied on nuclear power. Nuclear power generation involves the use of radioactive materials, such as uranium, as fuel.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who share a motel room in South Dakota? from the following article ? In Billings, Montana, a police officer arrives and discovers Woody Grant walking on the shoulder of the roadway. Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody's insistence on collecting the money. After Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. David pays a visit with his ex-girlfriend, Noel, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay. While in Rapid City, South Dakota, Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway. They stay with Woody's brother Ray, his wife, and their two sons, Cole and Bart. Woody and David visit a mechanic shop Woody once co-owned, followed by some beers at a bar. When David brings up Woody's alcoholism and problems within the family—with Woody implying that he did not love Kate nor really want children—they get into an argument. At another bar, they meet Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's air compressor decades ago. Over David's objections, Woody mentions winning the money and the barflies toast his good fortune. The next day, they learn that the news has spread through the town like wildfire. Answer:","completion":"The article does not provide specific information about who shares a motel room in South Dakota.

Is it possible to conclude that \\"A man carrying a canoe while camping with his dog.\\" if \\"The man is canoing down the river.\\"?","completion":"It is not possible to conclusively infer that \\"A man carrying a canoe while camping with his dog.\\" if \\"The man is canoeing down the river.\\" solely based on the information provided. The two statements give distinct information about the man's activities, and to draw a reliable conclusion that connects both pieces of information, more context or evidence is necessary. In the first statement, it indicates that the man is engaged in a camping activity, carrying a canoe, and is with his dog. Camping suggests that the man might be outdoors, spending his time in a natural setting, with a temporary accommodation for staying overnight. The detail of carrying a canoe implies that the man potentially engages in water-based activities such as canoeing, rafting, or kayaking that might require a canoe. Additionally, the presence of his dog denotes that the camping trip includes a companion animal and adds an aspect of companionship or outdoor recreation with a pet. On the other hand, the second statement simply indicates that the man is canoeing down a river. This statement focuses on the action of navigating in a canoe and the setting of being on the river. It does not provide us with details about whether this action is part of a camping trip, whether there is a dog present, or if the man is carrying the canoe at any point during this journey. To conclusively correlate these two statements, we need more information that establishes a connection between the man's camping experience with his dog and his canoe trip down the river. For example, if we were provided with information such as, \\"The man is camping by the river and, during his stay, takes his dog along for a canoeing trip,\\" we could successfully form a stronger link between the two initial statements. In conclusion, it's not accurate to infer that \\"A man carrying a canoe while camping with his dog\\" from the statement \\"The man is canoeing down the river\\" without more context or proof to solidify the relationship between the two scenarios. Additional information that ties both situations together would be necessary to make such a comprehensive inference."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Information: - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - Two Tragedy Poets ( ... And a Caravan of Weird Figures ) is the fifth studio album by Italian folk / power metal band Elvenking . It was released through AFM Records on November 14 , 2008 . The album is mostly acoustic ; it includes acoustic versions of two older tracks , \`\` The Winter Wake '' and \`\` The Wanderer '' , both from The Winter Wake . The Japanese edition also includes a remake of \`\` Skywards '' , originally released on the album Heathenreel . Although Elvenking 's website says otherwise , instead of \`\` The Wanderer ( acoustic version ) '' being a digipack bonus track , it 's \`\` My Little Moon '' . The album was preceded by an online single , which included another acoustic version of the band 's older song , \`\` The Perpetual Knot '' . - Kotipelto is a Finnish melodic power metal self-named band by Timo Kotipelto created during a hiatus in activity for power metal band Stratovarius. Kotipelto has been commercially well received in their native Finland, with a Top 10 single \\"Beginning\\" from his first release \\"Waiting for the Dawn\\", and lyrics often concentrating on ancient Egyptian themes. - Heathenreel is the debut album of Italian folk/power metal band Elvenking. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - Nostradameus was a power metal band from Gothenburg, Sweden. They were formed in 1998, and disbanded in 2016. Their latest release is \\"Illusion's Parade\\". - U.D.O. is a German heavy metal band founded by lead singer Udo Dirkschneider in 1987. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - AFM Records GmbH is a music label based in Schwalmstadt, Germany. They focus on the heavy metal musical genre, signing bands such as U.D.O., Doro, Kotipelto, Masterplan, Nostradameus, and Annihilator. What is the relationship between 'two tragedy poets ' and 'heavy metal music'? The answer is:","completion":"Two Tragedy Poets (...And a Caravan of Weird Figures) is the fifth studio album by Italian folk/power metal band Elvenking.

To find the best, we sorted through almost 300,000 demographic data points (which is why we partner with Onboard Informatics to collect it all). For the first cut, we eliminated the 100 places with the lowest predicted job growth, the 200 communities with the most crime, and any place without a strong sense of ethnic diversity (more than 90% of one race). Focusing further on pocketbook factors, we hunted for top home values by comparing median property values with median household incomes. We singled out communities with strong local economies and low taxes (property, income, and sales). We also considered accessibility to health care, culture, strong public schools, and sports. To correct for geographical biases, we limited the list to no more than four places per state and one per county. Reporters spent time in each town, interviewing residents, checking out neighborhoods, and searching for the kinds of intangible factors that aren’t visible in statistics. Finally, we arrived at this year’s Best Place to Live. NOTES: Rankings derived from 60 data points in the following categories: jobs based on income growth, local unemployment (not seasonally adjusted; county data used when local not available), and projected job growth. Economy based on purchasing power, foreclosure rate, tax burden, and state’s fiscal strength. Housing affordability based on median price-to-income ratio and average property taxes. Education based on test scores, educational interest and attainment, and percentage of kids in public schools. Health based on number of doctors and hospitals in the area and health of residents.

The negative sentiment is evident in multiple aspects of the review: 1. The use of capitalization in the title \\"THIS IS A BOOTLEG!\\" highlights the reviewer's sense of urgency and strong disappointment. Capitalization is often used to emphasize a point or express strong emotions, and in this case, it indicates a negative emotion towards the product. 2.

The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems.

Meanwhile, Newcastle. boss Alan Pardew and his backroom staff have attempted to tailor a. training programme for Ben Arfa in a bid to bring about an improvement in his form. But the 27-year-old remains far from peak fitness and was visibly out of shape during his last appearance as a substitute at Stoke earlier this month. One on occasion during that match he overran the ball and was clattered into by an opponent, suffering the dead leg which was said to have kept him out of last weekend’s defeat by Swansea City. He subsequently returned to France and it is thought he is unlikely to appear when Newcastle travel to Arsenal on Monday night. Out: Ben Arfa limps off after being injured against Stoke and will probably miss Monday's clash with Arsenal. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Hatem Ben Arfa, a France forward on the Newcastle United football team, is reportedly being targeted by Serie A team, Roma, in an £8 million deal. It seems that Newcastle’s management team has lost their patience with Ben Arfa due to his fitness and form deteriorating since the beginning of the year. His contract is set to expire the following summer, and there appears to be no likelihood of a renewal on the horizon. Therefore, Newcastle might consider cashing in when the current season ends, particularly as Italian reports suggest that Roma is actively monitoring Ben Arfa’s situation. Roma's coach, Rudi Garcia, is said to be interested in adding Ben Arfa to his team, with the intention of positioning him as a playmaker. In addition to Roma, Arsenal and Inter Milan are also rumored to be keen on the Frenchman. In an effort to aid Ben Arfa’s performance, Newcastle's manager, Alan Pardew, and his backroom staff have formulated a custom training program for him. However, the 27-year-old has yet to regain optimal fitness, as evidenced by his visible fatigue during his last appearance against Stoke as a substitute. In that match, Ben Arfa was tackled harshly by an opponent after overrunning the ball, resulting in a dead leg injury that kept him out of the following game against Swansea City. Ben Arfa was forced to return to France for treatment and is not expected to be fit for Newcastle's upcoming match against Arsenal on Monday night. This development might lead Newcastle to reconsider their options and look to capitalize on the interest generated by Roma and other teams. The potential sale of Ben Arfa would provide the club with funds to invest in new players and potentially improve their team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the Canon who is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible? , can you please find it? Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...

Simon Walters. and Glen Owen. UPDATED:. 05:46 EST, 13 November 2011. Tony Blair is facing questions after one of his charities launched a bid to grab a slice of Britain's £8billion foreign aid budget. His organisation has taken the first steps to become eligible for grants awarded by the Department for International Development to rebuild war-torn countries. The highly sensitive move has prompted concerns over a possible conflict of interest with Mr Blair's complex business dealings. Tony Blair is being made an honorary Paramount Chief in the village of Mahera in Sierra Leone. Of his estimated £7m-a-year earnings, about £2m comes from merchant bank JP Morgan, which has major interests in many of the countries receiving British aid. Of his estimated £7 million-a-year earnings, about £2 million comes from merchant bank JP Morgan, which has major interests in many of the countries receiving British aid. Mr Blair's charity has applied to join the tendering process for the Department for International Development (DfID) 'security and governance' scheme, which undertakes 'peace-building' work in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. The remit has raised eyebrows given the former Premier's disastrous decision to back the Iraq War. Last night, Conservative MPs said Mr Blair must prove that the pitch would not conflict with his lucrative commercial activities. Tory Philip Davies said: 'This is a very sensitive issue. The Government will have to be scrupulously careful with the award of any contracts to Mr Blair to ensure there can be no possible conflict of interest with his widespread business dealings in the Third World.' However, when asked about MPs' fears that the application could conflict with Mr Blair's business activities, a spokesman for the former Prime Minister said: 'On what basis do they claim there is a conflict? There is none, and to claim or imply otherwise is defamatory.' Mr Blair has applied to be considered for grants via the Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative. Curiously, the application has been made in the name of the Tony Blair Governance Initiative, omitting the word Africa. Mr Blair's spokesman said the charity only operated in Africa. Ex-PM Tony Blair talks with health workers at Rokupa Government Hospital in Freetown on a visit to Sierra Leone, where his charity and JP Morgan operate, last year. The charity is run from the same office in London's Grosvenor Square as his business empire, the Office of Tony Blair. They share the same PO Box address in Paddington and are registered at the same address near St James's Park. The PO Box address is also shared by Cherie Blair's Foundation For Women charity. DfID – the Whitehall department whose budget will rise to £11 billion by 2015 – is spending £787 million this year on 'governance and security' schemes. Of this, £34 million is going to Afghanistan and £1.7 million to Iraq. Large sums also go to African and other Asian countries. Individual contracts can be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. It is believed that some are worth millions, although a DfID spokesman refused to confirm this. A secret DfID document seen by The Mail on Sunday shows Mr Blair's name on the list of those who have applied for 'Lot A' of the DfID governance portfolio. If successful, his charity would then be on a list of organisations eligible to bid for contracts as they came up. Others on the application list include the 'Big Four' accountancy giants – Ernst & Young, KPMG, Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers – plus charities such as Save The Children and Christian Aid. Philip Davies MP warned Mr Blair is entering a very sensitive area of policy and the Government will have to be careful when awarding contracts. The document suggests that Mr Blair's record in Iraq and Afghanistan could be significant, as it states: 'Bidders should describe their approach to operating in conflict-affected and fragile states.' A DfID guide says bidders must prove their expertise in public sector reform and be able to help with 'the effective functioning of the Cabinet and PM's/President's offices'. That remit may raise eyebrows given that Mr Blair was criticised for his record on public service reform and the way he ran No 10, making key decisions with informal 'sofa diplomacy' sessions with his cronies, rather than the Cabinet system. International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell last night confirmed that Mr Blair had applied to be considered for DfID cash. He said 'The Tony Blair Governance Initiative has applied . . . to be eligible to compete for a contract on public sector governance. 'Their bid will be treated like any other and judged on value for money and effectiveness. All DfID contracts operate under strict rules designed to get the best for British taxpayers and deliver help to the world's poorest people.' Mr Blair has entered a three-stage tendering process in which he must show he is fit to run a major overseas aid project with public money. If Mr Blair's bid is approved, he will then face separate 'mini competitions' for individual contracts. His overall finances are shrouded in mystery, but it is understood that until now his charitable activities in the Third World have been funded mainly from his lucrative commercial activities. Adding Government money to this would represent a major expansion of his empire. Mr Blair is thought to have made about £25 million since leaving office, but the opaque way his finances are structured makes it almost impossible to establish the true size of his fortune. It is known that his property portfolio contains seven homes, worth £14 million. The Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative (AGI) is part of the Byzantine structure of companies, partnerships and consultancies constructed by the former PM. At the centre of the web is the Office of Tony Blair, based in Grosvenor Square, London, which co-ordinates all his activities. Aid to Sierra Leone is at the centre of concerns over a potential conflict of interest for Mr Blair. The office is funded by a structure called Windrush Ventures, into which much of his estimated £7 million-a-year income is funnelled. This income is derived from his commercial consultancy, Tony Blair Associates, the JP Morgan consultancy, another job with the Swiss insurer Zurich Financial Services and speaking engagements that can earn him six-figure payments. The AGI is registered as a charity, as is his Faith Foundation and Sports Foundation. However, last year the AGI was reprimanded by the Charities Commission for asking supporters to back Labour in the Election. The former PM divides his time between the charities and his diplomatic role as Middle East peace envoy for the 'Quartet' of the UN, Russia, America and the EU. Critics argue that much of his charitable work helps him to establish key political and commercial contacts around the world. Nick Thompson, the chief operating officer of AGI, previously headed the climate change unit at the Department for Business. Paul Skidmore, AGI's director of strategy and fundraising, is a former adviser to David Miliband; Andrew Ratcliffe, one of its project leaders, was in Mr Blair's Downing Street Strategy Unit, while Malte Gerhold, who is a project leader for AGI in Sierra Leone, worked in his Delivery Unit. Sierra Leone illustrates how Mr Blair could be open to claims that his business and governmental links could lead to a conflict of interest. The AGI is working to end the nation's dependence on aid, and has helped the government there to push through reforms, including fast-track commercial courts and easier financing from banks to small businesses. Meanwhile, JP Morgan has business interests in the country, including a stake in mining company Titanium Resources Group. DfID gave £45 million in aid in Sierra Leone in 2009/10, of which £18 million went on 'governance'. However, Mr Blair's spokesman insisted: 'Mr Blair does not do business in any of the countries that AGI operates in.' Mr Blair's AGI has come under fire from some quarters for advising Rwandan leader Paul Kagame, who has been accused of running a repressive regime. He has also advised Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on how to copy his style of running a government with a 'strong centre'. Mr Blair has already passed the first hurdle, which had the 51 applicants whittled down to 41. These will be reduced to 'about a dozen' who will be eligible to bid for future DfIF contracts.

I didn't know anything about the story, the cast, the director, or anything about the film's history. All I knew was it was a highly-acclaimed French film. Had I known more, I probably wouldn't have viewed the picture with an open mind. On paper, the premise doesn't sound interesting to me. Had I known what Chocolat was about ahead of time, my interest while watching would have been limited. However, not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it. Throughout, I had no clue has to where the story would go, what the characters would do, and what the end result would be. It was, if nothing else, not a predictable film. Indeed, it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks. Telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers. Since the lead character is seen in present day, the audience knows she will remain alive. By using the flashback technique, director Claire Denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage, giving the viewer the sense that Chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside. A lesser filmmaker would give France a haggard-looking face, one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood. Instead, Denis presents France as a beautiful girl, someone who looks fine on the outside. It could be argued that Chocolat is more about France's mother since she is given far more screen time, though I believe it is ultimately about France. To me, what Chocolat is really about is how a mother's actions affect her daughter. It is about how parents' behavior stays with their offspring. France is not ruined by her mother's actions in the story, yet her mother's actions clearly made an impression on France. Had France not been affected at all by her mother's actions, the flashback aspect would be irrelevant. For a movie that deals with two time periods, the past and the present, Chocolat was a very well paced, there were no scene of excess fat. None of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place. The film had nice rhythm, the editing crisp, leaving only what was necessary to tell the story. With a well told story, solid editing, and organized directing, Chocolat is one of the better French films I have seen. It was responsible for launching Claire Denis' career and with good reason: it's an incredible directorial debut. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is positive.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Ministers plan to overhaul the funding system in September 2017 and charge those studying to be front-line health workers for their degrees. But the Royal College of Nursing and Unison are warning it could turn people off NHS careers and worsen shortages. Student nurses, midwives and staff such as physiotherapists will be affected. They are currently entitled to bursaries of £4,500 to £5,500 if they live in London - on top of a grant of £1,000 each year during their course. The course fees are also covered. But the government has proposed scrapping these and introducing university fees to bring health staff in line with other students. Ministers argue that the move will lead to an increase in nurse students - of about 10,000 - as applicants for courses currently outnumber the places available by two to one. This is because there is a cap on places. But unions have warned the move could end up putting off prospective students. To strengthen their case, Unison and the National Union of Students commissioned research group London Economics to carry out an analysis of the potential impact. The research, based on modelling, suggested the numbers starting courses could drop by about 6.5% from 31,000 a year to 29,000. They argue the courses are quite different from normal studying as nurses spend half their time working in the NHS and do not get long holidays where they can spend time doing paid work as other students do. RCN general secretary Janet Davies said: \\"Our members tell us that the fees could put people off, particularly older students who come into nursing later on. They are very important for the diversity of the workforce. This seems a risky move at a time when we are short of staff.\\" Earlier this month, a report by the Public Accounts Committee warned that the NHS was short of about 50,000 front-line staff. Ms Davies said she would like to see the government pause its plans and carry out a full risk assessment to see what the likely impact will be. Her warning comes as nurses and other staff prepare to attend a rally in central London over the plans. Unison head of health Christina McAnea said she was worried the move could make \\"an already difficult situation much worse\\". \\"With too few staff on the wards, the impact on patient safety could well be disastrous.\\" A Department of Health spokesman said the changes were designed to increase the numbers in training and would mean students could access greater financial support in the form of loans, but he urged the profession to submit concerns to the consultation on the changes. \\"We need more home-grown nurses so the NHS doesn't have to rely on expensive agency staff or overseas nurses,\\" he added.

Would \\"If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane , there would be total solar eclipses every single month.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","completion":"Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on the Earth's surface and temporarily blocking the Sun's light. There are certain conditions that need to be met for a solar eclipse to happen, and to analyze if the given statement is reasonable, let's examine each condition more closely. 1. Perfectly circular orbit: The Moon's orbit is not perfectly circular; it is an ellipse with an average distance of about 384,400 km from the Earth. The distance between the Moon and Earth varies throughout its orbit, which affects the size of the Moon’s shadow during a solar eclipse. If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit around the Earth, it would maintain a consistent distance, and this could potentially contribute to more frequent solar eclipses. However, this alone is not enough to guarantee a total solar eclipse every month. 2. A little closer to the Earth: If the Moon were closer to the Earth, its apparent size in the sky would be larger, meaning it could more easily cover the Sun during a solar eclipse. This would increase the likelihood of a total solar eclipse, but again, it would still not guarantee a total solar eclipse every month. The distance between the Earth and Moon needs to be such that the angular size of the Moon is very close to the angular size of the Sun, in order for a total solar eclipse to occur. 3. In the same orbital plane: The Moon's orbit is inclined about 5.145° to the Earth's orbital plane around the Sun (the ecliptic). This inclination ensures that the Moon's shadow rarely falls directly on the Earth. If the Moon's orbit were aligned with the Earth's orbital plane, total solar eclipses would occur more frequently. This alignment would, by itself, be the most significant factor in the occurrence of monthly total solar eclipses. Considering these factors, the statement \\"If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit, a little closer to the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every single month.\\" is indeed reasonable. Each of these factors, together, contributes to the conditions required for more frequent solar eclipses. A perfectly circular orbit and a slightly closer distance to the Earth would allow for a more consistent shadow, while the same orbital plane would ensure that the Moon's shadow falls directly on the Earth more often. Keep in mind that even if these conditions were met, it does not imply that everyone on Earth would see a total solar eclipse every month. The visibility of a total solar eclipse would still depend on one's location on Earth's surface."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Departures (Japanese: okuribito, Hepburn: Okuribito, \\"one who sends off\\") is a 2008 Japanese drama film directed by Yojiro Takita and starring Masahiro Motoki, Ryoko Hirosue, and Tsutomu Yamazaki. Loosely based on Coffinman, a memoir by Shinmon Aoki, the film follows a young man who returns to his hometown after a failed career as a cellist and stumbles across work as a nokanshi--a traditional Japanese ritual mortician. He is subjected to prejudice from those around him, including from his wife, because of strong social taboos against people who deal with death. Eventually he earns their respect and learns the importance of interpersonal connections through the beauty and dignity of his work. Context: Motoki, by then in his early 40s and having built a reputation as a realist, was cast as Daigo. Veteran actor Tsutomu Yamazaki was selected for the role of Sasaki; Takita had worked with Yamazaki on We Are Not Alone (1993). Although the character of Mika was initially planned as being the same age as Daigo, the role went to pop singer Ryoko Hirosue, who had previously acted in Takita's Himitsu (Secret) in 1999. Takita explained that a younger actress would better represent the lead couple's growth out of naivety. In a 2009 interview, Takita stated that he had cast \\"everyone who was on my wish list\\". Motoki studied the art of encoffinment first-hand from a mortician, and assisted in an encoffining ceremony; he later stated that the experience imbued him with \\"a sense of mission ... to try to use as much human warmth as I could to restore [the deceased] to a lifelike presence for presentation to her family\\". Motoki then drilled himself by practising on his talent manager until he felt he had mastered the procedure, one whose intricate, delicate movements he compared to those of the Japanese tea ceremony. Takita attended funeral ceremonies to understand the feelings of bereaved families, while Yamazaki never participated in the encoffinment training. Motoki also learned how to play a cello for the earlier parts of the film. To provide realistic bodies while preventing the corpses from moving, after a lengthy casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing to the need to see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect. Question: Who was the casting director for the film?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The answer is that the casting director for the film \\"Departures\\" is not mentioned in the provided information.

Both have different preferences for the type of ball used. Joseph prefers a ball that bounces less and travels more slowly. Thomas, on the other hand, prefers a ball that travels more quickly and bounces more. and a hint : The balls used in squash are small rubber balls that can differ in terms of diameter, weight and softness. These features determine the speed and bouncing amplitude of the ball, with softer balls being generally slower than the harder balls. The temperature of the ball also affects the amount of bounce: the warmer the ball, the more it bounces.[3] Because cold squash balls have little bounce, the squash balls are hit multiple times at the beginning of a game to warm them up. It also means that a game becomes gradually faster as it advances and that softer balls may be too slow to be used in colder climates.[4] Please answer this question : Which player enjoys the speed of game less as it progresses? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is Joseph who would enjoy the speed of the game less as it progresses.

Holometabolism, or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes in four stages, an egg or embryo, a larva, a pupa and the adult or imago. In these species, an egg hatches to produce a larva, which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a pupa, a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a cocoon. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.:151 Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults.

Feel out the situation to see if it's best if you step back for a while or if you should be as present as you were before. It is important, though, that you don't show your crush you were incredibly hurt or that the rejection made you insecure. Most people don't find insecurity attractive, so continue to act confident. After you have given your crush some time to think over things, it's time to get back into their life. You may have decided to act like things are normal or maybe you gave them some space, but before you plan to ask them out again, you want to develop a relationship with them. If you weren't friends before, then becoming friends may be the key to gaining a date with your crush. It's possible that they didn't feel comfortable going out with someone they didn't know, so helping them get to know you could better your chances when you ask them out again. If you were friends before, you don't want to just go right back to where you were before in the friend zone. That may lead your crush to think that you have accepted there is no future between the two of you, and your crush may stop considering the possibility that you still like them. It's best to develop a friendship again but to show that you are interested in other things too, then they won't feel awkward around you. This isn't a shoo-in, but it always helps someone say yes to a date if they find you attractive. Consider going to a gym or trying out a different hairstyle to pique your crush's interest. It's also important that you have proper hygiene -- people don't usually want to go out with someone who doesn't take care of their body! It could be helpful to occasionally flirt with your crush, to show them that you are playfully considering them. You don't want to only flirt with them or flirt with them frequently, though. Make it clear that your options are open and that you are considering other people. Sometimes all it takes is jealousy to make your crush realize they are interested in you. Don't turn all your attention on someone else if you want your crush to know you are still interested in them. This may lead them to feel confused or believe that you have moved on completely. Before you ask them out again, you'll want to see if anything has changed in the way they are interacting with you. If they are acting somewhat playful or are suddenly interested in your other romantic interests, it could be a sign that they are beginning to see you as more than a friend. Now that you've had time to better your relationship and pique your crush's interest, you're probably ready to ask them out. However, it could be good to change up your approach from the last time to better your chances. Be confident and ask them in the way you think would receive the best answer. Be cool when you ask your crush out again -- don't seem desperate or like all you have been thinking about is asking them out again. Play it up like you'd love to treat them to lunch or coffee (or whatever it is you want to do) and make it seem somewhat casual. Or maybe do something fun like going to a concert, something that could also be done with a friend.Your crush may be more willing to go on a date like this if they feel you aren't trying to jump into something serious. If you did all this and were turned down again, it unfortunately may be a sign that you need to move on. Someone may reject you once without really thinking about it, but if they reject you a second time it means they had some time to think about it and still aren't interested. Respect their decision and understand that it obviously wasn't meant to be.

When Louise goes below deck, a large, strange cloud on the horizon passes over the craft, leaving a reflective mist on Scott's bare skin. The couple are puzzled by the phenomenon, which disappears as quickly as it had shown up. However, one morning six months later, Scott, who is 6Â ft 1Â in (1.85Â m) tall and 190 pounds (86Â kg), notices that his shirt and slacks seem to be too big, but blames it on the laundry service. As this trend continues, he believes he is shrinking and sees his physician, Dr. Bramson (William Schallert), who reassures him that he is in perfect health and that \\"people just don't get shorter.\\" Louise also dismisses his fears as silly, stating that he has simply been losing weight, but he continues to lose height and weight.

Finally, there is x-ray proof that Scott is getting smaller. His doctor refers him to the prominent laboratory, the California Medical Research Institute, and after nearly three weeks of sophisticated tests, Scott and his team of new doctors learn that the mist to which he was exposed was radioactive. This, combined with an accidental exposure to a large amount of common insecticide four months later, has set off a chain reaction that has rearranged Scott's molecular structure, causing his cells to shrink.

The first question asks, \\"Are all black people in America called African American?\\". It questions the terminology used to refer to black people in the United States and seeks to understand if the term \\"African American\\" is applied universally to all black individuals in the country. It is essential to recognize that not all black people in America identify themselves as \\"African American\\" since their heritage may be rooted in other geographies.

Two Gonzaga University students could be suspended or even expelled after using a handgun to defend themselves from an intruder in their university-owned apartment, an act which the university says violates the school's weapons policy. Gonzaga University, a private, four-year university in Spokane, Washington, says the students violated the school's weapons policy by having firearms in their apartment, which is in a complex near the campus. On the night of October 24, students Erik Fagan and Daniel McIntosh were in their apartment when there was a knock on the door. Fagan told CNN affiliate KXLY in Spokane that he opened the door and a stranger, who said he'd just gotten out of jail, asked for 15. Fagan told KXLY he offered the man a blanket and a can of food, but \\"didn't feel comfortable\\" giving the man money because he was a stranger. \\"My gut instinct was telling me I wasn't going to be able to get that door closed before he came through,\\" Fagan told KXLY. As the man started coming through the door, Fagan said, he yelled for his roommate, Daniel McIntosh. McIntosh said he came to the door with his pistol drawn, and the students said the man turned and ran away. Because the apartments are owned by Gonzaga, both police and campus security responded when Fagan and McIntosh called 911. According to the Gonzaga's Executive Vice President Earl Martin, all university housing is patrolled at regular intervals by campus security, though this particular apartment complex isn't gated and secured key cards or codes aren't required for entrance. A short while after the incident, police captured the man, whom they identified as a six-time convicted felon. At about 2 a.m., campus security officers returned to Fagan and McIntosh's apartment and confiscated a pistol and a shotgun from the apartment. Dean Chuang, attorney for Fagan and McIntosh, said the shotgun is owned by Fagan, who uses it to hunt periodically, and it wasn't used in the incident. He added that the pistol that was used in the incident belonged to McIntosh, and was a gift to him from his grandfather several years ago. McIntosh has a state-issued permit to carry a concealed handgun, Chuang said. In Washington state, gun owners are not required to register their weapons. In a disciplinary board hearing on Friday, the board, made up of three faculty members and two students, found Fagan and McIntosh guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons, according to Chuang. Chuang told CNN the students expect to hear later this week what disciplinary action will be taken by the board. Fagan and McIntosh both face suspension or expulsion. Both are seniors and have exemplary records, Chuang said. Meantime, Fagan and McIntosh have asked university security to return their firearms, but that hasn't yet happened. According to Chuang, one of the students had never lived in campus housing and was unaware of the school's weapons policy. The other, he said, was aware of the policy but didn't think it applied to him because the apartment isn't on campus. \\"They had the right to defend themselves and others, regardless of what the policy says,\\" Chuang told CNN. Though the university couldn't talk about specifics of this case due to privacy laws, Martin said, \\"I'm not aware of other instances like this in particular.\\" The policy, which is on the university's official website, states that weapons, which includes firearms, are prohibited \\"at any location on campus, or within University residences.\\" In a statement released Saturday by university President Thayne McCulloh, there have been calls for a re-examination of the university's policies relating to firearms. McCulloh said in the release he believes this is an opportunity for the university community to objectively re-examine the policy and \\"openly debate perspectives and contextual issues.\\" McCulloh's statement said he has asked the Vice President for Student Development to work with several campus organizations to \\"facilitate a campus dialogue focused on this issue.\\" Meantime, he added, the current student handbook and code of conduct remain in effect.

Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who had his appendix removed in April 1927?, using the article: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM).

However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a \\"Code Red\\", an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), an inexperienced U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer. Kaffee has a reputation for arranging plea bargains and has never even argued a case in a court room, which gives him time to devote himself to his passion for softball. It is indicated that he has a psychological fear about having to match up to his late father, Lionel Kaffee, a leading attorney, who is regarded as one of the great trial lawyers of recent times. Galloway manages to get herself appointed as Downey's lawyer, thus playing a part in the proceedings. The third member of the defense team is Kaffee's friend Lt.

Ticket Utils allows major sellers sell directly through StubHub, eBay, and Ticketmaster using software that automates some of the process. For example, sellers can automatically remove a ticket that has been sold on one marketplace from another where it is also listed. It also lets sellers list tickets in different currencies so that they can sell tickets in different countries. StubHub said that the software will be integrated into its own software for ticket sellers. The acquisition price was not disclosed. StubHub has replaced recently spun off payments company PayPal as eBay’s new crown jewel. In the most recent quarter, StubHub, which was acquired by eBay nine years ago, the site’s revenue rose 34% to 177 million, far faster than eBay’s overall revenue growth of 4%, to 2.1 billion. The ticket marketplace has also recently got new leadership. Last year, Scott Cutler, former head of global listings at the New York Stock Exchange, joined eBay to head StubHub. For more on eBay, watch: StubHub is now taking on Ticketmaster more directly by starting to partner with primary ticket holders like sports teams to sell tickets directly to buyers rather than through third-party sellers. StubHub is already partnering with the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers to power ticket sales for the 2016-2017 season, and recently inked a 100 million deal to become the ticket seller for the New York Yankees.

Connectivity was the name of the game at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, held last week in Las Vegas -- especially when it came to health-related products. From cloud-connected scales to music-connected sex toys, these gadgets rose above the rest as those that might really help you keep your New Year's resolutions. Sleep soundly. A small, lightweight band users wear on their heads during sleep, the Zeo Sleep System measures brain waves while you're in dreamland, and will sync via Bluetooth with your smart device. Zeo's free app plots out how many hours of quality snooze time you're getting each night. Great feedback for our highly caffeinated, tech-obsessed society, it also plots out sleep quality based on behaviors you input. How much did those three glasses of vino affect your sleep? How about that late night fast-food run, or actual run? Zeo gives you concrete tips for improving your sleep routine based on your habits, and will even wake you up at the optimum time in your sleep cycle. The Zeo is available for a one-time purchase price of 99. (No monthly subscription required.) Body bands. A bevy of body bands made a splash at CES this year, among them the BodyMedia Fit and the Basis Band. BodyMedia's Fit monitoring system consists of a small electric band the user wears on his or her arm, that works in conjunction with a software interface that's available on your smartphone or online. Users input their daily calorie intake, and the device monitors calories burned. The band uses sweat sensors, an accelerometer and skin temperature monitors to figure out how much exercise you're doing, and for how long. It compares that to your food intake to give a picture of your daily health. The accelerometer knows when you're lying on your back for hours at a time (presumably sleeping), and adds that to your fitness picture as well. The Fit CORE is available for 149, but requires plugging in to synch your data. The new Fit LINK is Bluetooth-enabled for wireless synching, and is available for 179. Both products require a 6.95 monthly subscription to BodyMedia's online dashboard. Similar to the BodyMedia's Fit, the Basis Band adds real-time heart rate monitoring to the mix by using a optical engine that \\"looks through the skin to see actual blood flow,\\" similar to the technology used in pulse oximeters (those little things they put on your finger at the doctor's office.) The Basis Band is also worn on the wrist rather than on the arm, and looks more like a trendy watch than a fitness monitor. The Basis is available for pre-order, shipping sometime this quarter; and will be 199. The price includes lifetime access to the cloud service and online interface -- no monthly subscription required. Smart medical devices. Smart medical devices abounded on the expo floor this year. The Withings Wi-fi Body Scale, a sleek device that looks like an iPhone you can step on, connects with your iPhone, or other iOS or Android-capable phone. The scale measures your weight, lean and fat mass and calculates your BMI almost instantaneously. To keep things simple (and less depressing), the display only shows your weight -- the rest of the information floats up to the cloud, and is available on your smartphone. The free app interface also lets you invite friends, family members or your doctor to view your progress; and it will keep track of data for up to eight users. The Withings Wi-fi Scale is available for 159, which includes lifetime access to the web and phone service. Unfortunately, just because this scale is cloud-connected, doesn't mean you're going to be any lighter. Withings also had another smart medical device: the iPhone Blood Pressure Cuff. Wrap it around your arm and then plug this bad boy into your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. A small compressor in the device inflates the cuff, using power from your device. Once the reading is complete, the information is logged in a free app, and is available to send to your doctor for analysis and tracking. The cuff is available for 129 with no recurring monthly fees. California-based iHealth Labs also brought a Wi-Fi scale and blood pressure cuff to the table; but a third product really caught our attention: the Smart GlucoMeter. As more of the connected generation starts dealing with diabetes, this high-tech tool may encourage diabetics to check their blood sugar more often. The device is simple: Plug a pack-of-gum-sized accessory into the bottom of your Apple device, insert a test strip, prick your finger (unfortunately, they haven't been able to eliminate that step). Put a drop of blood on the strip. Within a few seconds, the device measures your blood sugar, and catalogs it for you and your doctor to track. The GlucoMeter is pending approval with the FDA, and should be available in the latter half of 2012. The price has not yet been set. Health apps. Just as cool as some of the hardware at CES was the software. \\"Gamification\\" of health was a popular phrase on the show floor, and several companies weighed in with entries to that category. Among the coolest were ... UnitedHealth Group's OptumizeMe is a social fitness app that lets you challenge friends and family to get healthy. The app allows users to make their own health challenges or select from a list of popular challenges. Among them: competitions to see who can walk the most steps in a day, who can be the first to run 100 miles, and who can eat their daily servings of fruits and veggies. The app allows you to add a prize for the top dog and share your results on social networking sites with friends. OptumizeMe is a free app, and it allows you to sync fitness information with your employer's benefits plan if your company has United Healthcare coverage. (TimeWarner, CNN's parent company, is a member of United Healthcare insurance coverage.) This app isn't a new entry into the category, but a much improved one. Lose It! is a weight-loss management tool that allows users to keep track of food and exercise on the go. The app has a catalog of thousands of the most popular foods, and all of the nutrition information for each of them. Popular new additions to the app include bar-code scanning of your favorite prepackaged food items, the ability to create and share custom foods and recipes with your friends, and a FourSquare-like badge-earning system, that rewards users' daily entries, weight loss milestones, and sharing activities. Lose It! is a free app, and will integrate data from many of the connected medical devices listed above into your health picture. The cool stuff. There are a few other notable additions to the list, though they only sort of qualify as health devices. The 4Moms Origami Stroller is so cool, it might make you want a baby! This \\"iPhone of baby strollers\\" both collapses and rebuilds itself at the touch of a button, using on-board motors that are charged when the user pushes the stroller. It also features daytime-running lights, a cupholder, and a smartphone-charging pouch (using the same charge-as-you-push technology). An onboard LCD screen monitors the weather, battery level and whether or not your child is in the seat -- critical info if you're considering pushing the \\"fold\\" button. But rest assured, the device isn't as scatter-brained as new moms tend to be, and won't fold if your bambino is inside. The origami is available for 849. The Nest Thermostat gives some much needed love to the oft-neglected category of home heating and cooling interfaces. This 249 piece of wall art automatically learns your temperature preferences, and your comings and goings to make sure your house is cool when you want it to be. Users can also control the Wi-Fi connected device remotely via smartphone; and special plastic technology enables it to pick up the color of the wall it's on to blend in with your decor. And for those of you whose New Year's resolutions included having more, uh, fun in the bedroom, the OhMiBod musical vibrators use an audio-enabled microchips to vibrate to the beat of your favorite music. The line features personal-use and partner-friendly devices; even a wearable model to take with you to the clubs. This product was a little difficult to test on the show floor, though.

Title: The Midnight Meat Train Movie plot: The film opens with a bald man with a briefcase sitting in a moving subway car. As the lights flicker he hears a noise, causing him to stand up. As he walks towards the source of the sound, the next subway car, he slips and falls in a large pool of blood. He then peers through the window to the next car and sees a figure chopping up a bloody corpse. Leon (Bradley Cooper) is a vegan amateur photographer who wants to find unique spots of the L.A. cityscape to shoot and, at the advice of his contractor Susan (Brooke Shields), heads into the city's subway system at night. He is criticized constantly by other photographers for fleeing danger before shooting a full reel. One night, in a decision to break this trend, he saves a woman from a gang that is abusing her. The next day, he discovers this girl has gone missing. Leon is intrigued by the mystery, and begins to investigate newsreels about similar disappearances. His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany (Vinnie Jones), whom he suspects has been killing subway passengers for the past three years. Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him and, instead, cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims. Leon's involvement quickly turns into a dark obsession, upsetting his waitress girlfriend Maya (Leslie Bibb), who is as disbelieving of his story as the police chief. Leon takes matters into his own hands, entering the subway train at midnight, only to witness a shocking bloodbath, as the butcher kills several passengers, then hangs them on meat hooks. Passing out on the subway floor, he awakes the next morning in a slaughterhouse with strange markings carved into his chest. A concerned Maya and her friend Jurgis (Roger Bart) begin to examine the photos Leon has been taking of Mahogany, leading them to the killer's apartment. After breaking into the butcher's home, Jurgis is captured, and brutally killed. Maya goes to the police, but finds that they are as unwilling...

OPTIONS: * yes. * it is not possible to tell. * no.","completion":"This premise does not entail the hypothesis \\"No alternatives were considered.\\" The sentence asserts that no significant alternatives were considered, not that no alternatives at all were considered. To be more specific, the premise indicates that the Commission, while reviewing whatever matter was at hand, did not see any commenting parties bring up issues specifically in line with the initial regulatory flexibility analysis. Further, the premise also mentions that no significant alternatives were thought through or evaluated. The language and context suggest that some alternatives may have been considered, but they were not significant or impactful enough to be deemed worthy of consideration. However, the hypothesis in question simplifies the assertion in the premise to a point where it changes its meaning. \\"No alternatives were considered\\" is a starkly different claim from \\"no significant alternatives were considered.\\" The premise does not in any way indicate that no alternatives whatsoever were considered. Therefore, understanding this nuance is crucial for correct interpretation. To consider no alternatives at all would imply the absence of any other options, possibilities, or routes considered or deemed viable by the Commission. But as per the premise, some alternatives may have been considered, they were just not considered significant or impactful enough, hence they potentially didn't contribute to the final decision or outcome. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"No alternatives were considered\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"The Commission further notes that no commenting parties raised issues specifically in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, and that no significant alternatives were considered.\\" The shift in language alters the complete meaning and thus, the hypothesis is actually disproved by the premise.

We have the equation: -29 * o + 300 = -65 * o + 6 * o First, let's simplify the equation by adding the \\"o\\" terms on the right side. -65 * o + 6 * o = (-65 + 6) * o = -59 * o So now our equation is: -29 * o + 300 = -59 * o Next, let's add 59 * o to both sides of the equation to get all the \\"o\\" terms on one side: (-29 * o + 59 * o) + 300 = -59 * o + 59 * o This simplifies to: 30 * o + 300 = 0 Now we need to get the \\"o\\" term by itself. Let's subtract 300 from both sides: 30 * o + 300 - 300 = 0 - 300 This simplifies to: 30 * o = -300 Finally, we need to know what \\"o\\" is. So, we will divide both sides by 30: (30 * o) / 30 = -300 / 30 This simplifies to: o = -10 So the answer is: o = -10. And that's it!

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of increased carbon dioxide during summertime can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of photosynthesis. Direct effect: The increase in carbon dioxide concentration can enhance the rate of photosynthesis, as carbon dioxide is one of the essential reactants in the process. The higher availability of carbon dioxide can lead to more efficient photosynthesis, resulting in increased plant growth and productivity. Indirect effect: The increase in carbon dioxide levels may result in higher temperatures due to the greenhouse effect, which could in turn affect photosynthesis. Higher temperatures can influence the rate of water evaporation, leading to increased water uptake by the roots and potentially causing water stress in plants if the environmental conditions become too dry. Additionally, excessively high temperatures can damage the photosynthetic machinery in the leaves, reducing their efficiency. The stomata may also respond to these environmental changes by closing to conserve water, consequently limiting the intake of carbon dioxide — and thus, potentially reducing photosynthesis rates. Overall, while an increase in carbon dioxide levels during summertime can enhance photosynthesis, other indirect factors such as higher temperatures and water availability must also be considered, as they can impact the process as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

The sun is shining brightly, casting a warm glow on the scene while the shadows of the shrubs dance along the grass. The sound of birds harmoniously singing fills the air, making their presence known even though they are hidden from sight among the dense foliage of the overhanging trees. A gentle breeze whispers through the yard, carrying with it the sweet fragrance of freshly bloomed flowers, beckoning the busy bees and fluttering butterflies to sample their nectar. The two tools, a rusty, but sturdy shovel and an old rake with a few tines missing tell a tale of years of hard work tending to this once-meticulously maintained garden. It's evident that the owner of this yard has invested countless hours of effort into nurturing the various plants, from the vibrant roses standing proudly against the fence to the unassuming perennials peeking out from under the bushes. The gloves, though covered in dirt and sweat stains, are a testament to the labor of love and passion that was poured into this once-verdant oasis. As time went by, the garden began to show the inevitable signs of neglect, with thorny weeds slowly creeping their way into the once-pristine space. Despite this, the resilience of the plants shines through as they continue to bloom, yearning for the return of caring hands to tend to them once more. The yard, too, seems to hold onto hope, as its lush grass proves it is refusing to give in to the encroaching chaos. The resilient trees still stand tall, providing shelter and shade for the myriad of small creatures that call this space home. Neighboring children often peer through the fence, wondering about the stories and memories that this garden has witnessed. They marvel at the wild beauty that has emerged, allowing their imaginations to run wild with tales of fairies and magical creatures that could be residing behind the maze of untamed greenery. The adults, on the other hand, see it as a reminder of how life can slip away from us when we're not paying attention, unraveling what we once held dear. Yet, there's a sense of serenity in this forgotten paradise, where nature has taken over and reclaimed its rightful place. In the heart of it all, where the well-worn tools and gloves await the return of their master, a sense of hope lingers, gently reminding us that it is never too late to breathe life back into what may seem lost. As the sun begins to set, casting a golden hue on the weathered objects and bushes in the yard, the promise of renewal and rejuvenation shines brighter than ever, offering an invitation for a new beginning to anyone willing to accept it."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I have a new situation: 2018 was a very wet year for the Four Corners area, because of the subtropical ridge, 2019, on the other hand was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength in this year.

(Associated Press) Kofi Annan, Joint Special Envoy of the United Nations and the Arab League for Syria arrives for a meeting of the Action Group for Syria at the European headquarters of the United Nations, in Geneva,... (Associated Press) Sergey Lavrov says there is \\"no attempt in the document to impose on the Syrian people any type of transitional process.\\" Moscow had refused to back a provision that would call for Assad to step aside, insisting that outsiders cannot order a political solution for Syria. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. An international conference accepted a U.N.-brokered peace plan for Syria, but left open whether the country's president could be part of a transitional government. The U.S. backed away from demands that President Bashar Assad be excluded, hoping the concession would encourage Russia to put greater pressure on its longtime ally to end the violent crackdown that the opposition says has claimed over 14,000 lives. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted that Assad would still have to go, saying \\"it is now \\"incumbent on Russia and China to show Assad the writing on the wall.\\" Moscow had refused to back a provision that would call for Assad to step aside, insisting that outsiders cannot order a political solution for Syria. Syria envoy Kofi Annan said following talks that \\"it is for the people of Syria to come to a political agreement.\\" \\"I will doubt that the Syrians who have fought so hard to have independence ... will select people with blood on their hands to lead them,\\" he said. The envoy earlier warned the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States _ that if they fail to act at the talks hosted by the United Nations at its European headquarters in Geneva, they face an international crisis of \\"grave severity\\" that could spark violence across the region and provide a new front for terrorism. \\"History is a somber judge and it will judge us all harshly, if we prove incapable of taking the right path today,\\" he said. He appeared to specifically aim his words at Russia, Syria's most important ally, protector and arms supplier. The U.S. has been adamant that Assad should not be allowed to remain in power at the top of the transitional government, and there is little chance that the fragmented Syrian opposition would go along with any plan that does not explicitly say Bashar must go. \\"While many spoke of united support for one ... some simultaneously took national or collective initiatives of their own, undermining the process. This has fueled uncertainty in Syria, in turn fueling the flames of violence,\\" Annan said. \\"By being here today, you suggest the intention to show that leadership. But can you, can we follow through?\\" He said that \\"the way things have been going thus far _ we are not helping anyone. Let us break this trend and start being of some use.\\" Foreign ministers were rushed from luxury sedans into the elegant and sprawling Palais des Nations along with their legions of diplomats and aides and envoys from Europe, Turkey and three Arab countries representing groups within the Arab League. Russia and China, which has followed Russia's lead on Syria, have twice used their council veto to shield Syria from U.N. sanctions. Major regional players Iran and Saudi Arabia were not invited. The Russians objected to the Saudis, who support the Syrian opposition. The U.S. objected to Iran, which supports Assad's regime. Lavrov predicted the meeting had a \\"good chance\\" of finding a way forward, despite the grim conditions on the ground. Syria, verging on a full-blown civil war, has endured a particularly bloody week, with up to 125 people reported killed nationwide on Thursday alone. International tensions also heightened last week after Syria shot down a Turkish warplane, leading to Turkey setting up anti-aircraft guns on its border with its neighbor. Without agreement among the major powers on how to form a transitional government for the country, Assad's regime _ Iran's closest ally _ would be emboldened to try to remain in power indefinitely, and that would also complicate the U.S. aim of halting Iran's nuclear goals. British Foreign Secretary William Hague urged Russia and China to join Western nations in speaking with one voice on Syria, though he acknowledged that will be a stiff challenge. Hague noted that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told diplomats a U.N. monitoring mission in Syria would have to be pulled back if no diplomatic solution is found. \\"We haven't reached agreement in advance with Russia and China _ that remains very difficult. I don't know if it will be possible to do so. In the interest of saving thousands of lives of our international responsibilities, we will try to do so,\\" Hague told reporters. \\"It's been always been our view, of course, that a stable future for Syria, a real political process, means Assad leaving power.\\" The head of the struggling U.N. observer mission, Norwegian Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, has described the 300 monitors approved by the U.N. Security Council to enforce a failed April cease-fire as being largely confined to bureaucratic tasks and calling Syrians by phone because of the dangers on the ground. Their mandate expires on July 20. The negotiating text for the multinational conference calls for establishing a transitional government of national unity, with full executive powers, that could include members of Assad's government and the opposition and other groups. It would oversee the drafting of a new constitution and elections. \\"Ultimately, we want to stop the bloodshed in Syria. If that comes through political dialogue, we are willing to do that,\\" said Khalid Saleh, a spokesman for the Syrian National Council, a coalition of Syrian opposition groups based in Istanbul, Turkey. \\"We are not willing to negotiate (with) Mr. Assad and those who have murdered Syrians. We are not going to negotiate unless they leave Syria.\\" Clinton said Thursday in Riga, Latvia, that all participants in the Geneva meeting, including Russia, were on board with the transition plan. She told reporters that the invitations made clear that representatives \\"were coming on the basis of (Annan's) transition plan.\\" The United Nations says violence in the country has worsened since a cease-fire deal in April, and the bloodshed appears to be taking on dangerous sectarian overtones, with growing numbers of Syrians targeted on account of their religion. The increasing militarization of both sides in the conflict has Syria heading toward civil war. ______ Matthew Lee contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights Activists say 85 people were killed or are missing after a car bomb Activists say the car bombing was carried out by government It happened as diplomats discussed the crisis at a meeting in Geneva They agreed to a plan to end the bloodshed in Syria As a dozen delegations sat inside the U.N. headquarters in Geneva on Saturday, drafting a plan to end the bloody Syrian crisis, a large funeral procession made its way through a Damascus suburb, clapping and chanting loud slogans against the government. The man they were burying was wrapped in a Syrian revolutionary flag and had allegedly been killed by government forces. The crowd waved additional flags and shouted for freedom. Then there was a deafening explosion. In what opposition activists say was a government-organized car bombing, 85 people were killed and more than 300 people were wounded, most of them in critical condition. Activists posted videos to YouTube purportedly showing the moment of the bombing in Zamalka and its aftermath. After the loud crack and orange flash of the explosion come moaning and screams of \\"Allahu Akbar\\" (\\"God is great\\") from every direction. As the brown dust clears, the carnage becomes visible: charred bodies, missing limbs, people cradling the wounded or helping them to their feet, and pools of blood. The flag-wrapped body of the funeral victim was lying on the ground. Syrian opposition members say it was a car bomb timed to hit the procession in front of the mosque. An activist named Bassem, who spoke to CNN from a suburb near Zamalka, said snipers in army uniforms began firing on people in the morning, and that plain-clothed government \\"thugs\\" even went to the funeral. The security forces even fired on the crowd in the bombing's aftermath, killing a doctor who was trying to help the wounded, said Bassem, who asked that his last name not be used. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said the scores dead in Zamalka were among 174 people killed across the country Saturday. CNN cannot independently confirm the reports of casualties or violence because Syria restricts access by international journalists. At almost the same time the bombing happened in Zamalka, members of the international community forged their most specific plan to date on how to deal with the violence that has raged in Syria ever since the uprising began there last year. Former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the meeting in his role as the special envoy for Syria, representing both the United Nations and the League of Arab States. Annan drafted a six-point peace plan for Syria more than three months ago, detailing steps for all sides to take, but it has yet to be implemented. Those at the Geneva meeting agreed that the first step should be a recommitment to a cease-fire by both sides and implementation of Annan's plan without waiting for the actions of others, Annan said. A key to the process will be a transitional government, which Annan said could include members of the current Syrian regime. That makes it possible for President Bashar al-Assad to be a part of the transition, but Annan pointed out it is the Syrians who will decide the make-up. \\"I think people who have blood on their hands are hopefully not the only people in Syria,\\" Annan said after the meeting. \\"I think the government will have to be formed through discussion, negotiations, and by mutual consent. And I will doubt that the Syrians -- who have fought so hard for their independence, to be able to say how they're governed and who governs them -- will select people with blood on their hands to lead them.\\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the plan also makes clear the Syrian president cannot stay in power. \\"Assad will still have to go. He will never pass the mutual consent test, given the blood on his hands,\\" she said. The agreement also calls on the Syrian government to release detainees and allow journalists access to the country. The right to peaceful demonstrations must be respected, Annan said. Clinton said it is significant that all of the countries at the meeting were able to come to an agreement. \\"Every day that has gone by without unity on the Security Council and among the states gathered here is a day that has given comfort to Assad and his cronies and supporters. What we have done here is to strip away the fiction that he and those with blood on their hands can stay in power,\\" she said. Clinton said the the U.N. Security Council should endorse the plan, thus allowing the possibility of sanctions against Syria if the requirements aren't met. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that the document should not be interpreted as outside powers imposing a transitional government on the Syrians. That process, he said, must come from inside Syria. Annan was the one who called Saturday's meeting, inviting top diplomats from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and envoys from Turkey, the United Nations, the European Union and the Arab League. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"An international conference has accepted a U.N.-brokered peace plan for Syria, but has left open the question of whether the country's president, Bashar Assad, could be part of a transitional government.

Fingers were pointed at his wife and the man she was having an affair with in the middle of their divorce. The twins were 10 years old at the time, adopted from Ukraine. Shortly after the murder of Ted, their mother Generosa died of cancer, and the two are left without parents. In 2011, the siblings decide to reconcile their past. They visit the East Hampton home at 59 Middle Lane where the events took place, and they go to Ukraine together to visit the orphanage where they were adopted and the street where their birth mother lived. The home—which was featured in Variety before it was on the market to sell and was only available to rent—was built in 1995 and stands 7,000-square-feet on 2.2 acres of land. There are six bedrooms, six-and-a-half bathrooms, a solarium, library, gourmet kitchen, library and gym. Outside, there’s gated access, gardens, a pond, heated pool, pool house, and three-car garage. Though the tabloid murder history aspect might make this home hard to sell, the location is worth mention. Though it’s not directly on the ocean, the property is south of the highway and only a 15-minute walk to Two Mile Hollow. It’s also close to the Maidstone Club and about a five-minute drive from the village. ||||| Published on A murder in the Hamptons; a millionaire father is dead. Suspicion falls upon his wife and her lover. The stuff tabloid scandals are made of... But behind the headlines are the ruined lives of two young children -- twins Greg and Alexa Ammon, only ten years old. Adopted from the Ukraine when they were infants by Ted and Generosa Ammon, their young lives seem to be in a perpetual state of chaos. Just a few years after Ted's death, Generosa dies of cancer, and the two are orphaned for the second time. But in 2011, Greg and Alexa embark on a journey to reconcile with a past that they never knew. With a camera crew in tow, the twenty-year old twins, now living thousands of miles apart from each other, take two trips together. One is to the Long Island home that holds the painful memories of the deaths of their parents and the childhood they lost; the other is to the Ukraine and the childhood they escaped before they could know. Reuniting at the Alabama home of the aunt who raised them after their mother's death, it is clear that a lot remains unspoken between Greg and Alexa: tears that were never shed, questions that were never answered. Exploring and spending the night at 59 Middle Lane in Long Island prompts memories both breathtakingly poignant and unbearably painful: the beds they used to sleep in and the couch where their mother spent her final days; a favorite hiding place that housed the security system that was disabled the night their father died. But it is the journey to the Ukraine -- something Alexa has longed to do for years -- that proves even more startling. Beginning with a visit to the orphanage from where they were adopted, still filled with smiling parentless children and caretakers who well remember the malnourished twins who were adopted by an American couple, Greg and Alexa are lead to the street where their birth mother lived. The discovery of a family they never knew -- a family itself torn apart by alcoholism, scandal, and misfortune -- seems to give Greg and Alexa new perspective on the lives they might have led had it not been for the Ammons. Ultimately, brother and sister take the first steps towards realizing the ways in which tragedy and rebirth often go hand in hand, and that understanding one's place in the world can be both maddeningly complicated and unexpectedly sublime. **JOIN our mailing list for updates on release at www.59MIDDLELANE.com** ||||| Jun 11, 2017 3:14 PM Jun 11, 2017 3:14 PM In announcing that the house he and his sister now own has been put on the market, Greg Ammon stated, “Alexa and I are now ready to sell our childhood home as we are both moving forward with exciting new ventures. We truly hope our family home finds the right buyer who can enjoy the many happy memories we had here and appreciate the true beauty it has to offer.” An offer of 12,700,000 will match the ask for 59 Middle Lane in the Village of East Hampton, once owned by the siblings’ late parents, Ted and Generosa Ammon. It is understandable that Greg and Alexa Ammon and their broker, Town and Country, would want to use words like “family,” “beauty” and “happy memories” to describe an estate that has one of the more tragic and notorious histories of any house in the area. The plot is more Hollywood than Hamptons: A millionaire father is found murdered and suspicion falls upon his wife and her lover. This is the stuff that tabloid scandals are made of, and there was plenty of newsprint and broadcast time lavished on the death of Ted Ammon at the Middle Lane manse in October 2001. But behind the headlines was the possibility of ruined lives for the two young children, the twins Greg and Alexa, who had been adopted from the Ukraine and were then only 10 years old. In fact, these and related events were portrayed in a documentary, titled “59 Middle Lane,” which made its debut in 2012 at the Hamptons International Film Festival. (There was also, inevitably, a 2005 TV movie with the pedestrian title of “Murder in the Hamptons.”) That murder is such a rare occurrence in East Hampton was just one reason for the screaming headlines. Ted Ammon had been a major player on Wall Street, and among the volunteer positions he held was heading the Jazz at Lincoln Center program. And the crime scenario was right out of a James M. Cain potboiler because of the bitter divorce battle between Mr. Ammon and the attractive Generosa, who had taken up with a Long Island contractor, Daniel Pelosi. Eventually, Mr. Pelosi was convicted of entering the Ammons’ south-of-the-highway home and bludgeoning his lover’s husband to death. Three years after the murder, Generosa Ammon died of breast cancer, and after a custody fight the Ammon children were awarded to an aunt and uncle in Alabama, where they were raised. A rewarding aspect to the 2012 documentary, directed by Greg Ammon, was the poignant tale of twins whose lives were affected but not dictated by tragedy and who, at that time 20 years old, were searching for their roots and the rest of their family. That journey has also included Greg opening the Big Flower clothing boutique on Newtown Lane in East Hampton last year and Alexa graduating from the USC School of Cinematic Arts to embark on a career in film and photography. And now, apparently, it involves moving beyond Middle Lane. The English Manor-style home has, we’re told, “magnificent gardens, with pond, nestled on a manicured 2.2 lush acres.” A short distance to the ocean, the Maidstone Club and Main Street shopping, this newly staged home has 6 bedrooms, 6.5 baths, a solarium, a library, a gourmet kitchen, a family room, an exercise room, a heated pool, a pool house and a 3-car garage. Over the years, the property has been rented out with tenants expressing interest in buying it, but the siblings resisted. Now, the opening of Greg Ammon’s statement says it all: “Alexa and I are now ready to sell our childhood home.” ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

(AP) — A six-bedroom house in New York's Hamptons that was the site of a high-profile murder in 2001 is on the market for 12.7 million. Twins Greg and Alexa Ammon put the 7,000-square-foot East Hampton home up for sale this week, after renting it out for several years at a time. Newsday reports (http://nwsdy.li/2slmamL ) that the house is the site where handyman Daniel Pelosi murdered the siblings' father, Wall Street financier Ted Ammon. Pelosi had begun an affair with Ammon's wife, Generosa Ammon, whom the husband was in the process of divorcing. Pelosi killed Ted Ammon before the divorce was finalized, leaving Generosa to inherit his fortune. Pelosi was convicted in 2004 and is imprisoned at Attica Correctional Facility in upstate New York. He's eligible for parole in 2031. ___ Information from: Newsday, http://www.newsday.com ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"\\"59 Middle Lane\\" is a documentary made in 2012 that tells the story of Greg and Alexa Ammon, twins whose millionaire father, Ted Ammon, was murdered in 2001 in their East Hampton home when the children were 10 years old.

Objective: To make sure the dough doesnt expand out side the flowerpot Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options are: (I). Make sure that it doesn't cross the bottom 1/3 of the pot. (II). Make sure to fill it to the rim of the flower pot.","completion":"To evaluate which of the two suggested solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning when it comes to ensuring that the dough doesn't expand outside the flowerpot, let's analyze each option in detail. Option (I). Make sure that it doesn't cross the bottom 1/3 of the pot. This solution involves filling the flowerpot only up to one-third of its height. The reasoning behind this is that when the dough expands during the baking process, it will have enough space to rise without overflowing the pot. Typically, dough can double or even triple in size when proofing or baking, depending on the yeast activity and other factors. By occupying only the bottom third of the pot, there will be a sufficient buffer to accommodate the dough's increase in volume. Moreover, this approach also accounts for the yeast activity, which could be influenced by several factors such as temperature, humidity, and dough composition. By leaving a larger space for swelling, you reduce the likelihood that spillovers will occur due to unexpected increases in yeast activity. Overall, this solution is based on the idea of providing ample room for the dough to expand, which is sound when considering the naive physics principles of space and volume. Option (II). Make sure to fill it to the rim of the flower pot. This solution proposes filling the flowerpot entirely or up to its rim. This approach might seem reasonable, as it appears to maximize the available space for the dough. However, there are several issues with this logic. When the dough starts to expand due to yeast activity, the volume inside the pot will increase significantly. Filling the pot to the brim leaves little to no room for growth, which will likely result in the dough spilling over or even causing the pot to crack under the pressure. Moreover, overfilling the pot can lead to a dense final product, as the dough will not have the space it needs to expand and create air pockets. Restricted expansion can also cause uneven baking and affect the final texture of the bread or pastry. In conclusion, considering the principles of naive physics in terms of space and volume, Option (I) is more sound. It takes into account the growth of the dough during the baking process and leaves enough space to accommodate the dough's expansion without causing spills or negatively impacting the baking process. On the other hand, Option (II) poses a higher risk of overflowing and may result in an undesirable final product due to restricted expansion and uneven baking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose music, from the Fourth Symphony onwards, was strongly influenced by the music of Mahler?, what is it ?

The answer to the question: The mention of the author's brief voluntary institutionalization results in friction between which two characters? is inside the article: Writer David Lipsky is dismayed to hear about the suicide of novelist David Foster Wallace in 2008. He had interviewed the author over a period of days twelve years earlier, following the publication of Wallace's novel Infinite Jest, which received critical praise and became an international bestseller, a touchstone for numerous readers. He listens to the recordings he made during their time together. The film returns to the period shortly after the book's release. Although initially skeptical of the high praise Wallace's book is receiving, Lipsky – a writer having only marginal success – is awestruck after reading it. He persuades his editor at Rolling Stone magazine to give him an assignment to interview Wallace during his book tour. The journalist travels to meet Wallace at his home on the outskirts of Bloomington-Normal, Illinois (near Illinois State University where the author teaches writing). Lipsky finds the young author unassuming and amiable, but indifferent to being interviewed. Wallace permits Lipsky to tape-record their conversations, with the proviso that Lipsky won't use any direct quotes which Wallace asks to have taken \\"off the record\\" five minutes later. Wallace opens up to Lipsky on a variety of subjects, ranging from dogs to television to fame and self-identity, but remains somewhat guarded.

The narrative centers around David Lipsky, a journalist for Rolling Stone magazine who interviews David Foster Wallace, an acclaimed author known for his novel, Infinite Jest. Wallace, despite his indifferent attitude towards being interviewed, allows Lipsky to record their conversations with a specific condition, which Lipsky honors. However, despite the seemingly good rapport between them, the tension arises when Lipsky brings up a sensitive topic regarding Wallace's history. The subject in question is Wallace's past mental health problems, specifically a period of brief voluntary institutionalization under a suicide watch. Lipsky crosses an unspoken boundary when he mentions this part of Wallace's history. Wallace, who is already somewhat guarded during their conversations, likely feels this intrusion acutely. Thus, the friction arises due to Lipsky bringing up the topic that is deeply personal and likely distressing for Wallace. The result of this friction isn't explicitly discussed in the provided text, but presumably, this event would have impacted their ongoing conversations and potentially strained the relationship between Lipsky and Wallace. The inclusion of such personal details illustrates the conflicts and struggles that often arise during in-depth interviews, namely handling sensitive topics with care, respecting personal boundaries, and maintaining professional integrity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Some bird species undertake shorter migrations, travelling only as far as is required to avoid bad weather or obtain food. Irruptive species such as the boreal finches are one such group and can commonly be found at a location in one year and absent the next. This type of migration is normally associated with food availability. Species may also travel shorter distances over part of their range, with individuals from higher latitudes travelling into the existing range of conspecifics; others undertake partial migrations, where only a fraction of the population, usually females and subdominant males, migrates. Partial migration can form a large percentage of the migration behaviour of birds in some regions; in Australia, surveys found that 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerines were partially migratory. Altitudinal migration is a form of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes elevations and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, holding no fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.

You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Q: Background Paragraph: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Story: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year. Question: Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta? A:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the relationship between hypoxia and flooding. Usage: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. This means that when an area experiences flooding, it's more likely to develop hypoxia due to the presence of flooded soil. Part #2: The existence of hypoxic soils in wetlands. Usage: The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. This means that wetlands are usually characterized by having soils with low oxygen levels. Part #3: Mention of Mississippi Delta being a wetland. Usage: The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. This statement describes the Mississippi Delta as a place with abundant wetlands that experience flooding regularly. Part #4: Mention of Mojave Desert having very little precipitation or floodwater. Usage: The Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. This statement describes the Mojave Desert as a place with hardly any flooding or precipitation, which means less likelihood of flooded soil. Answer: Mojave Desert would be less prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta. This is because the Mojave Desert experiences very little precipitation and floodwater, while the Mississippi Delta has vast wetland areas that get inundated every year, increasing the likelihood of hypoxia due to flooded soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Some people may think that there is no other way to grow plants other than in soil; there is however, another way. Can we draw the following conclusion? Plants in soil are more nutritious","completion":"The conclusion that plants grown in soil are more nutritious is not supported by conclusive evidence. In fact, research in agricultural science and biology shows that a plant's nutritional value is determined by various factors, not just the medium in which it is grown. The nutritional value of a plant is primarily related to its specific species and variety, because different plants naturally contain different amounts and types of nutrients. For example, spinach will inherently contain more iron than lettuce, regardless of how either plant is grown. Moreover, plants take up nutrients from their surrounding environment. In order for plants to grow, they require light, air, water, and nutrients, which collectively are known as the 'essential elements'. The nutrients, which include nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, among others, can be obtained by plants either through soil or other nutrient solutions. The technique of growing plants without soil is known as hydroponics. In hydroponic systems, plants are grown in nutrient-rich water or in other non-soil mediums, such as perlite, clay pebbles, or coco coir. These mediums simply act as placeholders to support the plant while the nutrients are directly absorbed from the water. The main advantage of hydroponic systems is that they allow for greater control over the growing conditions, which potentially leads to increased efficiency and productivity compared to traditional soil cultivation. The ability to precisely control the nutrient solution allows farmers to optimize plant growth and, theoretically, to manipulate a plant's nutritional content. However, it's essential to note that increasing the amount of specific nutrients a plant absorbs doesn't necessarily enhance its nutritional value for humans. For example, a plant may be able to absorb larger amounts of certain nutrients, but the human body may not be able to effectively absorb or utilize those nutrients when the plant is consumed. While soil does provide a natural habitat for plants, and it is rich in nutrients and microorganisms that contribute to the overall health of the plant, claiming that the resulting produce is necessarily more nutritious is an oversimplification. Recent scientific studies have demonstrated similar nutritional content between hydroponically and conventionally grown plants, depending on the nutrient in question. Some research even suggests hydroponically grown plants may exhibit higher nutrient levels for some minerals, such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium. In conclusion, although soil-grown plants have their own advantages and are seen as the traditional or natural method of farming, it is not proven that they are definitively more nutritious than plants grown through hydroponics, or any other method. The nutritional value of a plant depends not only on its growing medium but also on a multitude of factors, from the specific variety of plant to the precise balance of essential elements it's able to absorb. Therefore, further research and comparison are needed to definitively determine which method of growing is superior nutritionally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Though intended as a theatrical feature , it was ultimately released directly to television . - Phil Tucker (May 22, 1927 November 30, 1985) was an American film director, writer, producer, and film editor. While Tucker directed his first six feature films in the span of two years (while still in his mid-20s), he is best known for his first film, the science fiction B movie \\"Robot Monster\\", often considered an example of \\"so bad it's good\\" film-making in the Ed Wood vein, and for the Lenny Bruce movie \\"Dance Hall Racket\\". - A B movie is a low-budget commercial movie that is not an arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified a film intended for distribution as the less-publicized, bottom half of a double feature. Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased by the end of the 1950s, the term \\"B movie\\" continued to be used in the broader sense it maintains today. In its postGolden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity. - Dance Hall Racket is a 1953 American film directed by Phil Tucker starring Lenny Bruce (who also wrote the script) and his wife Honey Harlow. - Leonard Alfred Schneider (October 13, 1925 August 3, 1966), better known by his stage name Lenny Bruce, was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, satirist, and screenwriter. He was renowned for his open, free-style and critical form of comedy which integrated satire, politics, religion, sex, and vulgarity. His 1964 conviction in an obscenity trial was followed by a posthumous pardon, the first in the history of New York state, by then-Governor George Pataki in 2003. He paved the way for future outspoken counterculture-era comedians, and his trial for obscenity is seen as a landmark for freedom of speech in the United States. - Robot Monster (a.k.a.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who is decided to not be an enemy of the Amazons? , can you please find it? In ancient times, the Amazons, a proud and fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battled Ares, the god of war, and his army. During the battle, Hippolyta specifically targeted and beheaded her son Thrax, whom Ares forcibly conceived with her and who is fighting for his father. Hippolyta then defeated Ares, but Zeus stopped her from delivering the death strike. Instead, Hera bound his powers with magic bracers so that he was deprived of his ability to draw power from the psychic aura of violence and death he could instigate, and only another god could release him. In compensation, the Amazons were granted the island of Themyscira, where they would remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man in the course of their duty of holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Later, Hippolyta was granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shaped from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gave life with her own blood. Over a millennium later, an American fighter pilot, USAF Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 on the island, where he soon runs afoul of the Amazon population, including the combative Artemis. Steve and Diana meet and fight, and Diana defeats him, taking him to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the use of the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana defies her mother and, her face hidden by a helmet and her guard duty covered by her bookish but kind-hearted Amazon sister Alexa, participates in contests of strength and wins the right to take Trevor back to his home.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \\"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \\"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \\"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body.

A:","completion":"Absorption primarily takes place in the digestive system of the body, which is a complex and interconnected series of organs and structures that work together to break down ingested food and liquids, extract the essential nutrients, and ultimately excrete the waste products. The primary organs and structures involved in absorption are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. Each part of the digestive system plays a specific role in the overall process of absorption. 1. Mouth: The process of absorption begins in the mouth, where enzymes present in the saliva initiate the breakdown of carbohydrates. However, little to no absorption of nutrients occurs in the mouth itself, as its primary function is to mechanically break down food through mastication (chewing) and mix it with saliva to form a bolus, which can be easily swallowed. 2. Esophagus: The esophagus acts as a conduit for the bolus to travel from the mouth to the stomach. No absorption occurs in the esophagus, as its main function is to transport the food through muscular contractions called peristalsis. 3. Stomach: The stomach serves as a temporary holding tank for the ingested food and plays a very limited role in absorption. Its primary function is to secrete gastric juices, which contain hydrochloric acid and enzymes that break down proteins and further mix the food, turning it into partially digested liquid called chyme. Some substances, such as alcohol and certain medications, can be absorbed through the stomach wall into the bloodstream, but most nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine. 4. Small Intestine: The small intestine is the primary site of absorption in the body. The small intestine is divided into three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Each section has unique functions, but they all play a role in nutrient absorption. 4.1. Duodenum: The duodenum is the first and shortest section of the small intestine. It receives chyme from the stomach, along with digestive enzymes and bicarbonate ions from the pancreas and bile from the liver and gallbladder. These secretions help to neutralize the stomach acids and further break down the nutrients in the chyme. Most importantly, the duodenum is responsible for the absorption of iron and calcium. 4.2. Jejunum: The jejunum is the middle section of the small intestine and is the primary site for absorption of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and water-soluble vitamins. The lining of the jejunum contains small, finger-like projections called villi, which are covered in even smaller projections called microvilli. This structure increases the surface area available for absorption, allowing nutrients to be efficiently taken up by the bloodstream. 4.3. Ileum: The ileum is the final and longest section of the small intestine. It is responsible for the absorption of bile salts, vitamin B12, and any remaining nutrients not absorbed in the previous sections. The ileum also absorbs water and electrolytes, ensuring that the body maintains a proper balance of fluids. 5. Large Intestine: The principal function of the large intestine, or colon, is to absorb water, electrolytes, and some vitamins produced by enteric bacteria, while also forming and storing feces. Although some absorption does occur within the large intestine, its contribution to nutrient absorption is minimal compared to the small intestine. 6. Rectum: The rectum serves as a temporary storage site for feces before they are expelled from the body through the anus. No nutrient absorption occurs in the rectum. In summary, absorption primarily takes place in the small intestine, where essential nutrients from the ingested food are extracted and taken up by the bloodstream. Other parts of the digestive system, such as the stomach and large intestine, also contribute to the absorption of specific substances, but their overall contribution is relatively limited compared to that of the small intestine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - england - iowa - street corner - city - town The answer is:","completion":"town. The question describes a corner shop as the epicenter of activity, where everybody who knew everybody hung around. This setting suggests a close-knit community where people are familiar with each other, which is more likely to be found in a small town rather than a larger city or an entire country. A small town would have a limited number of gathering spots, making the corner shop a natural location for people to spend time and socialize. While the option of \\"street corner\\" is also a localized gathering place, it doesn't convey the broader community feel that a small town does, nor does it emphasize the close relationships between the people. A street corner could exist in a city or any other location and may not be as personal as a small town setting. The options \\"england\\" and \\"iowa\\" refer to geographical locations that are not suitable in this context since they do not specifically address small, close-knit communities. A small town, on the other hand, is more likely to foster a friendly, neighborly atmosphere where everyone knows each other as implied in the question. Therefore, based on these factors and common sense, the most appropriate answer to describe the corner shop's significance would be \\"town.\\" It brings to mind a smaller community where close relationships are maintained, and there are fewer social spaces to choose from, such as a local corner shop."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nathan had been friends with Jessica for a while and planned to ask her out, but as approaching her she gets into Kenneth's car. In distress, he returns home, drinks alcohol and prepares to hang himself.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: If you are afraid of the dark,it's not a big deal.It's perfectly normal to feel afraid After all,animals do too. \\"Fear matters,\\"says Karen Warkentin,an ecologist.\\"It's a good thing,\\" she adds, \\"because fear makes you do things that keep you alive.\\" Like kids,many animals experience fear and they respond to the feeling in variety of ways.A frightened turtle pulls its head and legs inside its shell.A small fish will swim away when a big,hungry fish approaches. Some animals respond to fear in ways you might not expect.The first example is that the fear of being eaten can scare some frogs right out of their eggs. Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica. In this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs. Tree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape. If hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water. Answer:","completion":"Question: According to the article, why might red-eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica hatch their eggs earlier than their usual 6-day period? A) Because they have matured faster than other species. B) To escape from a nearing threat of snakes. C) Because their eggs are damaged. D) To join other already hatched tadpoles in the water. Justification: The article mentions that tree frog eggs ordinarily grow for 6 days before hatching. However, if they sense the approach of a hungry snake, they can hatch up to 2 days early to escape, as snakes can't swim. Thus, option B accurately reflects this information from the article.

To provide a more detailed description, I will outline each of the steps in their proper order. 1. Fertilization: The process begins when a sperm cell successfully fuses with an egg cell during sexual intercourse or other assisted reproductive techniques, such as in-vitro fertilization. This union forms the zygote, a single cell containing genetic information from both parents. 2. The sperm implants itself into the egg: After fertilization, the sperm's genetic material combines with the egg's genetic material, creating the basis for a new, unique individual. 3. The sperm and egg form a zygote on the wall of the uterus: After fertilization, the zygote travels through the fallopian tube toward the uterus. During this journey, the zygote undergoes several rounds of cell division, forming a blastocyst. Upon arrival, it implants itself into the lining of the uterus, where it can receive nutrients and oxygen from the mother's body for further development. 4. The fetus grows and develops: Over the course of about 9 months, the implanted zygote grows and develops into a full-term fetus. It receives nourishment from the mother via the placenta and undergoes various stages of development, evolving from an embryo to a fully formed baby. 5. The woman gives birth to the baby: Once the baby has fully developed and is ready to survive independently, the mother gives birth. This can occur either naturally through vaginal delivery or via a surgical procedure called a cesarean section. 6. The baby is raised by parents until it is able to take care of itself: The newborn baby, now an individual separate from its mother, is cared for by one or both parents, as well as other caregivers or family members. The child continues to develop physically, mentally, and emotionally as it learns to care for itself through various milestones like crawling, walking, and socialization. 7. The person goes out into the world and finds a job: As the individual grows and reaches adulthood, they seek employment or higher education to gain skills and knowledge that will enable them to build a fulfilling and independent life. 8. The person meets other people and has a life: Throughout their life, the person forms various social connections, friendships, and romantic relationships. They also experience personal growth through hobbies, interests, and personal achievements. 9. The person gets a career, and gets married: Many people establish a long-term career path and form a lasting partnership through marriage or other committed relationships, further shaping their personal and professional lives. 10. The person retires and eventually passes away: As individuals age, they typically reach a point where they retire from their careers and transition into a new phase of life. This period may include leisure time, travel, volunteer work, or pursuing new interests. Eventually, like all living beings, the person's life comes to an end as they pass away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university's utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge. As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. Official scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society. After 1700, a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe, and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies. In reference to this growth, Bernard de Fontenelle coined the term \\"the Age of Academies\\" to describe the 18th century.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

The star of Les Vampires, Irma Vep, was played by a French actress named Musidora. In a search for an actress to play Irma, René has become impressed with Chinese martial artist, Maggie Cheung [herself], because of her beauty, her grace, and her presence, he says. Maggie is hired and flies to Paris from Hong Kong. Unfortunately, she is three days late in arriving, which is causing havoc with the filming. It also doesn't help that Maggie does not speak French.First thing on the agenda is for Maggie to be fitted in her costume, a skin-tight latex catsuit, much like the one worn by Halle Berry in Catwoman. Next, Maggie grabs some lunch with costumer Zoé [Nathalie Richard] and learns that René Vidal's reputation as a director is going downhill. To Maggie, however, he seems to believe in the remaking of Les Vampires, so she isn't worried. Then comes the shoots. They shoot the scene where Irma is chloroformed and a double substituted in her place.

Here is an article: The Entrepreneur Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in America’s startup scene contribute answers to timely questions about entrepreneurship and careers. Today’s answer to the question “How do you stay inspired to run a business?” is written by Neil Powell, cofounder of Mugnacious. There are a countless number reasons why you might want to start your own business. You might be tired of working for someone else and know in your heart that you can do it better. You might have an idea you believe the world simply can’t exist without. You want the freedom of being able to dictate your own schedule. Or, you just think it would be cool. For me, it’s always been one part ego, one part being able to do what I want when I want, and one part knowing that what I’m building is mine. There’s no one-size-fits-all “right” reason to start a business, but whatever pushes you to do it in the first place needs to be strong enough to keep you going when you’re five years in, wondering how you got yourself into it. For most of us who have our own businesses, it will take many years of sacrifice and hard work to achieve business success—however you define that concept. Whether you’re overworked, underpaid, or growing faster than you can handle, there will be times you’re going to need something to draw from to keep you going. See also: The Keys to Success in Entrepreneurship In the planning phase, it’s all so perfect. You can see yourself in your new office—the one designed by you, filled with furniture and art you picked out, answering the phone in a cheerful tone, going to the bank with a skip in your step, ordering office supplies while you sip your latte. It’s all very exciting. It’s a rush, and there’s nothing else quite like it. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with letting yourself have those feelings. In fact, if you don’t feel that way, starting your own business is probably not the right path for you, because eventually, some of the newness will wear off. The business you thought was going to be all creative exploration and groundbreaking ideas actually involves quite a bit of boring paperwork and ordering stuff from Staples. Soon, you begin to remember what it was like when there was someone else to do all of that stuff for you, and the day-to-day can begin to feel like a slog—but only if you let it. This is why I believe you have to secure and hold onto that thing that made you want to launch your business in the first place, way back when you just had a great idea in your head and weren’t worried about making payroll. Make it your mantra. Write it into your personal mission statement. Whether it’s the strength of your business concept, your independence, or making your mom proud, it doesn’t really matter, so long as it’s personal and you truly believe in it. I frequently find myself thinking back on why I’m an entrepreneur. What on earth compelled me to leave the resources and the free coffee and the four weeks vacation and the security of a paycheck to go it alone? The first thing I do every morning before I begin my day is remember and mentally recite my reasons for wanting my own business: I value my independence. I thrive on building something I can show off and be proud of. I need to have a sense of ownership over my work. This is what gets me through each day. Building a business is a great way to get to know who you really are as a person and as a professional. During that process, make sure you’re paying attention to what got you there, and what keeps you going every day—literally. Take some time to sit and think about it. Write it down if you have to, and pull that piece of paper out on the bad days. It’s easy to lose focus in the haze of trying to manage people and money and clients and forget about yourself. But in knowing the “why” of what you’re doing, the “how” will fall into place.

You can tell a lot about your cat by how it acts in and around its litter box. Watch how often your cat goes to the bathroom. Answer:","completion":"c). Most cats go to the bathroom outside in their litter box, so check your cat's litter box at least once a day. If your cat goes from the bathroom to the bedroom while you are sleeping or if it stays back and doesn't go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, you may have a problem. To properly identify cat stool problems, it is essential to pay close attention to your cat's litter box habits and behavior. Since most cats go to the bathroom outside in their litter box, regular monitoring of their litter box use is crucial. By checking your cat's litter box at least once a day, you will be able to spot any changes or issues in their bathroom habits more easily. In addition to daily checks, be aware of your cat's routines and movements around your home. If your cat goes from the bathroom to the bedroom while you are sleeping, or if it stays back and doesn't go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, there might be a problem. This could indicate that your cat is experiencing pain or discomfort while using the litter box or that it is avoiding the litter box due to fear or anxiety. When evaluating your cat's litter box use, take note of the following: 1. Frequency: Is your cat using the litter box more or less often than usual? Both increased and decreased frequency can signal a problem with their bowels, such as constipation or diarrhea. 2. Consistency and appearance: Pay attention to the texture, color, and shape of your cat's stool. Abnormalities such as overly hard or soft stool, blood, or an odd color may indicate gastrointestinal issues or other health concerns. 3. Odor: A significant change in the odor of your cat's stool could also be a warning sign. Unusually foul-smelling stool can suggest a problem with your cat's digestive system or a change in their diet. 4. Straining or vocalizing: If you notice your cat straining, crying, or making other painful sounds while using the litter box, this could be a sign of constipation, a urinary problem, or another painful condition. 5. Positioning and movement: Observe your cat's posture and movement while in the litter box. If your cat is having difficulty positioning itself or seems uncomfortable, this may indicate a problem with its stool or overall health. By closely monitoring your cat's litter box habits, you will be better equipped to identify any stool problems and address them promptly. Early detection of issues can help prevent more serious complications and ensure your cat gets the necessary care and treatment to maintain optimal health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many historians[who?] erroneously assume gold was standardized at a fixed rate in parity with silver; however, there is no evidence of Congress making this law. This has to do with Alexander Hamilton's suggestion to Congress of a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold, respectively. The gold coins that were minted however, were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver dollar. 1834 saw a shift in the gold standard to 23.2 grains (1.50 g), followed by a slight adjustment to 23.22 grains (1.505 g) in 1837 (16:1 ratio).[citation needed] How many grains of gold did the Mint Act define the dollar as?

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the song where there is a chorus of women's voices wordlessly by the composer who was inspired by Walt Whitman? , can you please find it? Vaughan Williams' program note for A Sea Symphony discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, \\"The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically.\\" Walt Whitman's poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of free verse became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be \\"pushed about by the music\\", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, \\"Veni, Creator Spiritus\\", in what music writer and critic Michael Steinberg referred to as \\"an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations\\". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his Sinfonia Antartica, based on his music for the film Scott of the Antarctic, to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's Seventh Symphony, also known as A Toltec Symphony, the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed \\"from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture\\". A:","completion":"The name of the song where there is a chorus of women's voices wordlessly by the composer who was inspired by Walt Whitman is Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia Antartica.

The action scenes are particularly gripping. 4. The remake is much glossier but also takes place mostly in real time, using long takes, genuinely disturbing violence and stretches with no dialogue to pin you to the story. 5. It must be said that The Last House on the Left is really well done, with impressive performances, masterful creation of dread and tension, perfect pacing, intense storytelling, haunting cinematography, truly sickening sound effects, and all. 6.

Does \\"Many other neighborhoods remain distressed, with extensive abandonment of properties.\\" correctly answer the question of What is one of the problems that currently effects property values in Detroit?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Many other neighborhoods remain distressed, with extensive abandonment of properties.\\" does correctly address one of the problems that currently affects property values in Detroit. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, various factors contributing to the issue should be elaborated upon. Detroit, once a booming city known for its automotive industry, has experienced significant economic and social decline over the past several decades. This decline has had a substantial impact on property values across the city. While there are several factors contributing to this decrease in property values, one of the most visible and well-documented problems is the extensive abandonment of properties in many neighborhoods. The abandonment of properties can be attributed to a combination of factors. The following are key drivers of property abandonment and subsequent decrease in property values in Detroit: 1. Economic decline: Detroit has faced considerable economic challenges since the decline of its automobile industry. High unemployment rates, loss of businesses, and decreased job opportunities have led to financial hardships for many residents, causing some to leave their homes and the city altogether. 2. Population decline: As job opportunities dwindled, the city's population significantly decreased, resulting in less demand for housing and a surplus of vacant properties. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Detroit's population has dropped by more than 60% since its peak in 1950. 3. Rising crime rates: Detroit has struggled with high crime rates that have further deterred potential homeowners and businesses from investing in the city. The lack of adequate law enforcement resources and blighted neighborhoods have aggravated this issue. 4. Deteriorating infrastructure: The aging infrastructure and reduced public services, resulting from budget constraints faced by the city, have led to the decay of many neighborhoods. This has had a significant negative impact on the quality of life for remaining residents and discouraged potential new residents. 5. Foreclosures and tax nonpayment: High foreclosure rates, exacerbated by predatory lending practices leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, and the residents' inability to pay property taxes have contributed to the abandonment of properties. 6. Poor urban planning and land use policies: Some of Detroit's urban planning policies, such as the growth of large suburban-style developments and single-family homes, have led to inefficient land use, sprawl, and increased difficulty in repurposing abandoned properties for new uses. The extensive abandonment of properties has created a cyclical problem: as neighborhoods deteriorate and lose value, remaining residents have a harder time selling their homes or attracting new investment and development. Moreover, abandoned properties also attract crime, further lowering the quality of life and making it even more challenging to improve property values. In conclusion, the statement that many neighborhoods in Detroit remain distressed due to extensive property abandonment addresses one of the significant problems impacting property values in the city. However, it is essential to recognize the complex interplay of economic, social, and political factors contributing to the city's challenges. Tackling the issue of abandoned properties and reversing the decline in property values would require a coordinated approach addressing these various contributing factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Choices: (1). No. (2). Yes.","completion":"(1). No. The suggested answer seems to be unrelated to the question asked. Cardiac issues with amitriptyline are a separate concern. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant used to treat depression, neuropathic pain, and other conditions. Although it has some side effects, including reducing aggression and violent behavior, this is not connected to the question about its rarity in causing cardiac issues. Regarding the rarity of cardiac issues with amitriptyline, it is important to note that while side effects can occur, not everyone experiences them. Cardiac side effects associated with amitriptyline can include changes in heart rhythm, rapid heartbeat, and fluctuations in blood pressure. These side effects are considered relatively rare; however, they can be more common in certain populations, such as elderly people or individuals with a history of heart problems.

Not that SAPS AT SEA is a bad film - it is the last good comedy (unless one insists on JITTERBUGS or another of the later films) that Laurel & Hardy made. It's just that it is a toss-off little film, without the crazy destructive crescendo of BLOCK-HEADS or the astounding sight of Stan's \\"real\\" personality in A CHUMP AT OXFORD to revel in. At 57 minutes it is shorter than the other two films a bit, but that actually is not a bad point for it. It has just enough time to it to hit the right notes. It's just not as special as the other two. Stan and Ollie work in a factory that manufactures horns. I suspect that there was a bit of Chaplin influence in this sequence (one recalls a similar assembly-line incident in MODERN TIMES only four years earlier). Ollie's nerves finally snap, and he goes on a rampage. He goes home and (naturally) his roommate Stan does not help - Stan has a music lesson with an eccentric professor on his instrument (you've got it - a trombone). After beating up the poor professor, Ollie has problems with the incompetent janitor/engineer (Ben Turpin in a nice brief appearance), and then faces his doctor (Jimmy Finleyson) and his nerve tester (a balloon that inflates as you push air out of Ollie's stomach). Finleyson announces that it is a bad case of \\"horniphobia\\", and Ollie needs a vacation with plenty of quiet and goat's milk. They end up going to a ship but Ollie and Stan know nothing about seamanship - so they plan to sleep on the ship. Unfortunately the goat gnaws the rope until it breaks and the ship sails off. Also unfortunately, on board is Richard Cramer, an escaped dangerous criminal. This is not going to be a peaceful vacation. SAPS AT SEA (like A CHUMP) could have been three shorts, one at the factory, one at the apartment, and one on the boat. Each would have been a successful short, and they all make a funny film - but the stitching of the parts together shows. There are some very amusing moments in the film - the discoveries of how Turpin's ineptitude causes various mishaps with water taps and stoves in the apartment; the accidental remarks of building manager Charlie Hall when Stan or Ollie runs by him and asks for directions (\\"Can you help me find the basement?\\" asks Stan - \\"Certainly,you can't miss it - it's downstairs!\\", says Hall, who realizes what a stupid comment he just made); and Cramer's mistreatment of his two hostage slaves. He calls Ollie \\"Dizzy\\" and Stan \\"Daffy\\" (an allusion to the Dean Brothers of the St. Louis Cardinal teams of the 1930s - see Dan Dailey's THE PRIDE OF ST. LOUIS). Cramer has the boys cook him up some food - and they make a synthetic meal (boot laces for spaghetti, for instance) to get him sick to be overpowered.

SAPS AT SEA is not on par with the top line of Laurel & Hardy films, but it is a good film on the whole, and a good conclusion to the best years of their film career (1927 - 1940) when they were with Hal Roach. In the immediate couple of years before it appeared the boys and Roach had serious problems involving production costs (OUR RELATIONS, where Stan was producer on the film), artistic problems (scenes from SWISS MISS were cut meaninglessly), and contractual arguments (leading to Ollie appearing with Harry Langdon in ZENOBIA). Stan and Ollie hit back with THE FLYING DEUCES, wherein the production was not Roach's but Boris Morros'. At last a two picture deal of A CHUMP AT OXFORD and SAPS AT SEA concluded the arguments and problems - and on a high note the boys left Roach. Unfortunately they never found any subsequent film relationship with a producer as satisfactory as this had been.

Question: \\"The English were aligned with what country for a long time?\\" Context: \\"Many middle and small powers in Europe, unlike in the previous wars, tried to steer clear away from the escalating conflict, even though they had interests in the conflict or with the belligerents, like Denmark-Norway. The Dutch Republic, long-time British ally, kept its neutrality intact, fearing the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe, even tried to prevent Britain's domination in India. Naples, Sicily, and Savoy, although sided with Franco-Spanish party, declined to join the coalition under the fear of British power. The taxation needed for war caused the Russian people considerable hardship, being added to the taxation of salt and alcohol begun by Empress Elizabeth in 1759 to complete her addition to the Winter Palace. Like Sweden, Russia concluded a separate peace with Prussia.\\" Answer:","completion":"The English, or more specifically, Great Britain, had a long-standing alliance with the Dutch Republic, also known as the Netherlands or Holland. This alliance was founded on mutual interests in trade, economics, and balance of power. Dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688, England and the Dutch Republic formed a Protestant alliance against the Catholic powers in Europe. William III of Orange, who was a Dutch stadtholder, became king of England, Scotland, and Ireland, underlining the closeness of the two nations. Moreover, both powers were involved in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) on the same side, fighting against France and Spain. Throughout the 18th century, this alliance continued despite having periods of tension and disputes, especially related to trade. The given context highlights the situation during the Seven Years War (1756-1763), a global conflict that involved all the great powers of the world. Despite having an alliance with England, the Dutch remained neutral due to the odds against Britain and Prussia fighting the great powers of Europe including France, Russia, and Austria. The Dutch even tried to prevent Britain's domination in India, conveying the complexity of their relationship. For a long time, The Dutch-English alliance was considered a balanced power system, with the Dutch concerned about the expansion of France towards the Low Countries (Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg), and England wary of France's naval power and colonies abroad, particularly in America. This alliance remained significant for centuries, though it suffered from diplomatic and economic strains. As the context suggests, by the time of the Seven Years War, the Dutch preferred to maintain their neutrality and avoid direct involvement in the conflict, even if it meant deviating from their long-standing alliance with Britain. So, while the relationship between the English and the Dutch Republic wasn't always simple or without issues, their alliance remained a notable factor in European diplomacy for a considerable length of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process: - Air is brought in through the mouth - Passes through the lungs - And into the bronchial tissue - The carbon dioxide is removed - The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose if lungs stop working properly and at a lower rate happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, refers to the idea that if the lungs stop working properly and function at a lower rate, it will result in a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. To assess the potential effects of this perturbation on the process of respiration and whether it has a direct or indirect effect, let us examine each step in detail. 1. Air is brought in through the mouth: If the perturbation affects the lungs, there might not be any immediate impact on the process of air intake through the mouth. Breathing might continue, although the volume or rate of airflow might be affected due to the decreased lung function. 2. Passes through the lungs: The compromised lung function in the perturbation hypothesis will likely result in difficulty moving air through the lungs, leading to inadequate oxygenation of inhaled air. Reduced air movement and oxygen-poor air can lead to overall decreased lung efficiency. 3. Into the bronchial tissue: With the lowered rate of lung function, the air that reaches the bronchial tissue may contain less oxygen than normal, which in turn decreases the amount of oxygen that can be absorbed into the bloodstream. In addition to this, other symptoms such as inflammation or narrowed airways can further exacerbate the problems associated with airflow in the bronchial tissue. 4. The carbon dioxide is removed: As the lungs struggle to function properly, their ability to remove carbon dioxide from the body could become impaired. A buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream can lead to acidosis, which in turn can cause respiratory failure if left untreated. 5. The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body: With a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream due to the perturbation, the body will struggle to maintain adequate oxygen levels to support essential physiological processes. This can lead to tissue hypoxia, which is a condition where body tissues don't receive sufficient oxygen to function optimally. When the oxygen level becomes critically low, organs can begin to shut down, leading to potentially life-threatening complications. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of compromised lung function, leading to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, has both direct and indirect impacts on the overall respiration process. The direct effect is a result of poor oxygenation of the blood due to impaired lung function, while the indirect effects include potential complications like tissue hypoxia, acidosis, and organ damage. This stresses the importance of maintaining proper lung function for overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In order to become an affiliate and participate in affiliate marketing, you need to have a website with significant traffic. Many affiliate marketers start by creating content and posting affiliate links on their page. You'll have to make sure the website is yours and doesn't ban affiliate marketing by agreement with the hosting service. See how to make a website for more information. You will need to cultivate the ability to start new websites, buy domain names, host pages and make landing pages. These skills will become important as you begin CPA marketing. PPC advertising allows you to drive traffic to your site by placing ads on other, relevant websites. You pay the ad provider a small amount for each time a web user clicks through your ad to your website. You can learn how this works through YouTube videos, online tutorials or by trial and error. Set up an account in Google AdWords and Microsoft adCenter, and pay for some ads that drive traffic to your website, in order to practice while you learn. Pay-per-click advertising can get expensive quickly, especially in a keyword bidding war (when another website or websites also wants to advertise for the same keywords). You also run the risk of routinely paying for clicks that don't lead to sales for you. Always analyze these risk before getting started in PPC. The best way to become a CPA marketer is to learn how to drive traffic to websites. The following are ways that people learn to drive traffic. Practice creating and promoting fan pages and groups on Facebook. If you know how to get \\"likes,\\" then you are on your way to driving traffic to a lead landing page. This usually takes a passion for staying in touch with followers and trying new creative social media strategies. Practice creating videos and YouTube channels. If you are an expert in a field or you can call on other people to create creative or instructive videos, this content grabs attention. Once you have traffic, you can post links to landing pages where you can gather lead information. Learn how to make and buy Internet ads. If you have graphic design skills and you don't want to create content on a blog or YouTube, then this may be the best option for you. You can find prime ad spaces, through services like BuySellAds, and purchase the ad space for a period of time. If the ad is targeted successfully, people will click on the link and type in their information, giving you leads. You will need to subtract the cost of the ad in order to figure out your return on investment. Become adept at using PPC advertising to get traffic to your landing page. Similar to buying ad space, you will need to bid on keywords in order to place the link to your landing page where you will get noticed. If you have a lot of experience with search engine advertising, this may be the best option for you. Use all of the methods you have learned to try to increase traffic to your website. You'll want to try to bring on a specific type of traffic that is marketable to CPA networks. This type of traffic, that you can turn into leads for your advertisers, is called \\"targeted traffic.\\" It involves targeting a certain need or type of person and offering what they need or or are looking for.

It is more dangerous to eat yogurt with a knife rather than a spoon, because the","completion":"sharp edges of the knife pose a heightened risk of causing injury while consuming the yogurt. Moreover, the metal blade increases the likelihood of accidentally cutting one's lips, cheeks, or tongue, potentially leading to painful cuts or lacerations that may require medical attention. In addition, the flat, narrow surface of the knife is not designed for scooping, which can result in less efficient consumption of the yogurt, as well as potential messes and spills. Furthermore, if the knife is not made from a material suited for such use, like stainless steel, it may corrode or degrade over time when exposed to the acidic environment typically present in yogurt. This might lead to the consumption of unhealthy and harmful substances, such as rust or oxidized metal particles, potentially causing adverse health effects in the long run. Another aspect to consider is that, when using a knife to eat yogurt, there is a higher chance of inadvertently flicking yogurt onto nearby surfaces, clothes, or bystanders, due to the unsteady nature of holding and maneuvering the knife in such a manner. This could lead to social awkwardness or embarrassment, as well as the need for additional cleanup efforts. Conversely, a spoon is specifically designed for scooping and consuming yogurt and other soft, semi-solid foods, with its smooth, curved shape and deep indentation allowing for an optimal and enjoyable eating experience. Using a spoon minimizes the risk of injury and promotes a clean and efficient consumption process, maximizing the pleasure and satisfaction derived from the yogurt. In conclusion, it is significantly more dangerous and less practical to eat yogurt with a knife, as it exposes the user to greater potential for injury, inefficient consumption, and messes.

Whether or not your rabbit is leashed and out for a walk or in an outdoor playpen, it’s vital to your pet’s safely that you keep a close eye on it. This can prevent attacks by predators, your rabbit from escaping, or it getting tangled in the leash. Avoid staking your rabbit in the yard and leaving it alone. Your rabbit can get tangled in its leash, which can cause injury or even death. Predators can also snatch your rabbit or it may chew through its leash and escape if you are not watching. Many outdoor areas use pesticides and weedkiller on grass or in gardens, both of which are areas bunnies like to snack. These can harm or kill your bunny. Checking out the area properly before you start walking outside and keeping an eye out for spraying as well as new plant growth can prevent your bunny from ingesting dangerous substances. Find out public areas that have pesticides or weedkiller by calling your local county extension. You can find out your local county extension at http://npic.orst.edu/pest/countyext.htm. Recognize that many plants may be poisonous to your bunny including: agave leaves, amaryllis, azalea, buttercup leaves, daffodil, eggplant, hyacinth, iris, ivy, jonquil, lily-of-the-valley, mistletoe, narcissus, ranunculus, sweet pea seeds, sweet potato, tomato leaves, tulip, wisteria. You can find a comprehensive list of plants poisonous to rabbits at: http://rabbit.org/poisonous-plants/. There are a wide variety of animals that are natural predators to rabbits. Dogs, birds, raccoons and other animals may harm your rabbit. Keeping an eye out for predators in the area where you’re walking can prevent injury or death for your bunny. Be aware that even if a predator doesn’t attack your rabbit, it can die from the stress of fear at a potential predator. Walking your rabbit outside, especially in the summer, can expose it to a host of bugs that can harm your rabbit. Keep bugs away as much as you can during the walk and look at your bunny’s skin when you get home for ticks or bites. Be aware that mosquitos and flies can bite your rabbit and transmit diseases such as Myxomatosis. Go over your rabbits fur gently to examine its skin when you get home. Look for ticks, fleas, or other bugs that can transmit diseases or cause your bunny discomfort. Heat is a very serious concern for rabbits that go outside. If the temperature outside is at or near 28 degrees Celsuis/ 82 degrees Fahrenheit, take care when walking your rabbit. Watch for the signs of heatstroke and take measures to reduce your rabbit’s temperature if you notice them. Recognize that the signs of heatstroke in a rabbit are: reddened ears, panting, lethargy, salivating, weakness and slow movement, acting confused, having seizures. Contact your rabbit to the vet as soon as possible if you notice any signs of heatstroke. While you are waiting, you can bring down the rabbit’s temperature by placing it in tepid water or wrapping it in cool, wet towels. Avoid placing a rabbit that is heat-stressed in cold or iced water.

What is the best way to: To rough out the interior of a wooden bowl.","completion":"The process of roughing out the interior of a wooden bowl requires certain amount of woodworking skills, carefulness, and use of specific tools. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide: 1. Safety Equipment: Ensure you have safety goggles to protect your eyes from wood chips. Consider gloves to protect your hands from sharp tools and dust mask to protect you from inhaling wood dust. 2. Selection of Wood: The choice of wood depends on what the finished product should look like. You can choose from oak, walnut, maple or cherry. Make sure the wood is well-seasoned (dried out), as green wood can warp or split as it dries. 3. Preparing the Blank: Your bowl starts as a block of wood, known as a blank. Using a band saw, cut a circular blank. Make sure your saw is set up properly before you start cutting, ensuring that the blade is sharp and tensioned correctly. Your blank should be a bit larger in diameter and thickness than what you want to achieve with the finished bowl. 4. Mounting the Blank: Mount the blank on a wood lathe using a faceplate or a chuck. Center the blank correctly on the lathe. This holds your wood still while you shape it with your tools. 5. Shaping the Outside: Turn on the lathe with slow speed first. Holding your bowl gouge firmly, start smoothing out the edges until you get a round shape. You can then create the general form of the outside of your bowl. 6. Hollowing Out the Bowl: After shaping the outside, turn the blank around to start shaping the inside of the bowl. Start from the rim towards the base. Keep the lathe speed slow and use a bowl gouge for this part. Keep checking the wall thickness frequently as you're hollowing the bowl out. 7. Fine Tuning: For better finishing use a scraper to smooth any gouge marks left by the bowl gouge. 8. Sanding: After you have the shape you want and the bowl is smoothed out, you need to sand it. Start with coarse grit sandpaper and gradually move to finer grits to achieve increasingly smoother finishes. 9. Finishing: Finally, apply a finishing coat. This could be oil, lacquer, or wax that suits the type of wood you used. This not only enhances the look of the grain but also protects the wood. 10. Final Check and Removal: Check the entire bowl for any unevenness or sharp edges. Make sure the wall thickness is even. After you're satisfied with the finishing, turn off the lathe and remove the bowl. Remember that creating a wooden bowl involves a good amount of time and patience. Be careful while using the lathe and other sharp woodworking tools, and remember to follow the manufacturer’s instructions for safety and usage of every tool you use. As with every skill, the key is practice. The more bowls you make, the better you’ll get at judging the thickness and curvature of your bowl as you’re hollowing it out."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Question: \\"Which happened later, Newfoundland reverted to colonial status or the ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy was recognized?\\" Context: \\"The ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy, independent of Britain, was recognised at the 1923 Imperial Conference. Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. After pressure from Ireland and South Africa, the 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, declaring the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations\\". This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster. The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression. Ireland distanced itself further from Britain with the introduction of a new constitution in 1937, making it a republic in all but name.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"Newfoundland reverted to colonial status later than the ability of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy was recognized. The recognition of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy independent of Britain was acknowledged during the 1923 Imperial Conference. This recognition was fueled by the refusal of Canada and South Africa to provide military assistance during the Chanak Crisis and Canada's decision not to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. The 1926 Imperial Conference issued the Balfour Declaration, which declared the Dominions to be \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another\\" within a \\"British Commonwealth of Nations.\\" The 1931 Statute of Westminster then gave legislative independence to the parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State, and Newfoundland. This meant that these Dominions could nullify British laws, and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent. Comparatively, Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, a decade after the recognition of the Dominions' ability to set their own foreign policy. This reversion was primarily due to financial difficulties faced during the Great Depression, which led Newfoundland to lose its legislative independence and be directly governed by Britain once again. In conclusion, Newfoundland's reversion to colonial status happened later than the recognition of the Dominions' ability to set their own foreign policy. The acknowledgment of the Dominions' foreign policy independence occurred in 1923 with the Imperial Conference, followed by further solidification in 1926 through the Balfour Declaration and the 1931 Statute of Westminster. In contrast, Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933 as a result of financial struggles during the Great Depression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Simon's characters are typically portrayed as \\"imperfect, unheroic figures who are at heart decent human beings\\", according to Koprince, and she traces Simon's style of comedy to that of Menander, a playwright of ancient Greece. Menander, like Simon, also used average people in domestic life settings, the stories also blending humor and tragedy into his themes. Many of Simon's most memorable plays are built around two-character scenes, as in segments of California Suite and Plaza Suite. Before writing, Simon tries to create an image of his characters.

Confiding to his friend Michael Morgan (Ian Hendry) that Damien is the Antichrist, Bugenhagen attempts to convince him to give Damien's guardian a box containing the means to kill Damien. As Morgan is unconvinced, Bugenhagen takes him to some local ruins to see the mural of Yigael's Wall, which was said to have been drawn by one who saw the Devil and had visions of the Antichrist as he would appear from birth to death. Though Morgan believes him upon seeing an ancient depiction of the Antichrist with Damien's face, both he and Bugenhagen are buried alive as the tunnel collapses on them. Seven years later, the 12-year old Damien (Jonathan Scott-Taylor) is living with his uncle, industrialist Richard Thorn (William Holden) and his wife, Ann (Lee Grant). Damien gets along well with his cousin Mark (Lucas Donat), Richard's son from his first marriage, with whom he is enrolled in a military academy.

These reasons reflect the importance of weather conditions in ensuring a pleasant and successful visit, taking into account factors like personal preferences, safety, and the ability to partake in various activities. 1. Personal comfort and preferences: Understanding the weather conditions during the planned visit is crucial to ensure that both Quinn and Austin are comfortable and can enjoy their time together. Different people have varying preferences when it comes to weather, such as a preference for warm and sunny days over colder, rainy ones. By asking Austin to describe the weather, Quinn can gauge whether the conditions would suit both their preferences, ensuring that they both have an enjoyable experience. 2. Appropriate clothing and packing: Knowing the weather conditions ahead of time enables Quinn to pack the appropriate clothing and accessories for the visit. This might include rain gear, warm clothing, or light and breezy attire, depending on the expected weather. Being suitably dressed for the weather can significantly enhance one's overall comfort and enjoyment during a visit. 3. Outdoor activities and events: Weather can greatly impact the availability and feasibility of participating in outdoor activities or attending local events. If Quinn and Austin were planning to partake in specific outdoor activities or visit certain attractions during their time together, it would be helpful for Quinn to know the weather conditions in advance to determine if these plans are viable or if alternatives need to be arranged. 4. Health and safety concerns: Adverse weather conditions, such as extreme temperatures, heavy rain, or strong winds, can pose health and safety risks. Quinn may want to ensure that the weather during the planned visit does not pose any potential hazards that might jeopardize their well-being or interfere with their travel plans. 5. Travel logistics: Weather can have a significant impact on travel logistics, such as causing flight delays, cancellations, or hazardous driving conditions. By knowing the expected weather, Quinn can plan accordingly and make necessary adjustments to their travel plans, if needed. This can help minimize potential disruptions or inconveniences during the visit. 6. Optimal timing for the visit: Lastly, Quinn's inquiry about the weather might indicate their attempt to determine the optimal time for the visit. By understanding the local weather patterns and comparing them to their preferences and schedule, Quinn can choose the best time for their visit to maximize their enjoyment and minimize any potential issues related to weather conditions. In summary, Quinn's request for Austin to describe the weather during the planning of the visit likely stems from various motives rooted in personal preferences, practical considerations, and the overall quality of the experience.

Kent village remained traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. Long Grove on the other hand took a wider perspective and created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all played an important role in developing Long Grove village. and a hint : Rural development is the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in rural areas, often relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas.[1] Rural development has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5] Rural development is a comprehensive term. It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system. we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears.

For those enjoying the unseasonably warm weather, the blast of freezing Arctic cold sweeping across Britain is in unwelcome reminder of what winter's normally like. But anyone with an eye for a stunning photograph is sure to welcome the dusting of snow which helps create a picturesque winter scene. The scene below was the view earlier today across Carr Shields in Northumberland, as a icy weather front swept south across the country from Siberia. Winter arrives: The unseasonably mild winter gave way to cold and snow which turned Carr Shields, Northumberland, pictured, into a picturesque snowy scene. Freezing: Weather forecasters saying the cold weather could last into February as homes in Allendale, Northumberland, stoke up their fires to keep warm. Forecasters expect temperatures are set to drop as low as -2C overnight. The. Department of Health issued a. 'Level 2' cold-weather alert running for the next two to three days,. which is triggered when low temperatures give rise to significant health. risks. It warned that low temperatures can especially be dangerous for the young and the elderly or those with chronic disease. Meanwhile, the Met Office put much of. Britain on a 'yellow alert' for people to 'be aware' of the adverse. weather conditions. It said: 'Icy stretches are expected to form on untreated surfaces, especially in places affected by showers. 'The. showers will fall as snow above about 250 metres, but there may be. temporary slush deposits to lower levels. The public should be aware of. possible travel disruption.' Forecasters say snow is likely to fall. on Monday across northern England, Wales and parts of the south-west. There will also be snow showers in East Anglia and the south-east on. Tuesday. Dan Williams, of the Met Office,. said: ‘This is certainly the longest run of colder weather we will have. seen so far this winter. 'There’s. cold air pushing in from the east, and it’s looking very wintry over. the next few days and might last for the first half of February.’ The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east. Snow fun: Youngster Amy Eager, five, has fun on a sledge in Bowes, County Durham, as heavy snow arrives in Britain this weekend. Cold snap: A cyclist braves the cold on the Pennine hill tops near Skipton, in the Yorkshire Dales. Chill: A man walks his dog through the snow at Kilhope, County Durham, as the country braced itself for a spell of cooler weather that has brought snow to some regions. Britain has seen very little wintry weather so far this season – but nothing is ever straightforward with our weather. After three consecutive harsh winters we have reverted to what is seen as more typical winter weather. Perhaps this year we have felt cheated by above-average temperatures and just a few frosty mornings. Now the snowdrops have appeared in the garden it seems that spring is not too far away. Prior to the winter of 2008-09 there had been only one truly harsh winter in the previous 17 years – and that began late in the season. Cold winds first reached us from Siberia in thefinal week of January 1995, leading to heavy snow showers. So could there be a sting in the tail this year?History says it can happen, even after one of the mildest winters on record. As recently as last Wednesday the temperature peaked at 12.1C at Hawarden in Flintshire, but a band of heavy rain sweeping into the North Sea by Thursday brought cold winds and snow showers to higher ground. The prospects for the coming week are for the coldest weather so far, with hard frosts overnight, snow flurries and perhaps just the higher ground seeing any heavy snow. Latest forecasts say tonight will. remain mainly dry overnight, with light winds and clear spells allowing a. widespread frost and some patches of freezing fog to form. Far northern. and western areas will be cloudier and a little milder however, with. spells of mostly light rain. Sunday is expected to be cloudy with. some rain in western parts, with snow over hills in Wales and. southwestern England later. Otherwise mainly fine after any fog clears,. although showery in the far east. On Monday a slow-moving band of rain. with hill snow in western parts will continue on Monday, before cold,. and bright conditions with isolated showers push westwards towards. midweek. Over the next couple of weeks, the. weather is forecast to be mostly settled and cold leading up to the. first weekend, especially towards the southeast of England, with. widespread overnight frost and some wintry coastal showers towards the. east. However, northwestern parts will soon. become cloudier, more unsettled, but milder with spells of rain and. some snow, the snow mainly on hills. Although there is considerable. uncertainty, the bright, cold conditions will probably continue for a. time into the second week in the east. The unsettled but milder conditions. in the west will probably spread erratically further east with time,. introducing spells of rain and some snow, again mainly on hills. This. progression may be coupled with strong winds and possibly gales in. northwestern parts. The cold spell breaks what has so far been one of the warmest winters on record. The snow is triggered by a warm Atlantic weather system from the west clashing with cold air in the east. Forecasters said it was becoming. increasingly likely that the freezing temperatures would stick around. and even last through the whole of February. George. Goodfellow of the Met Office said: ‘It seems like we are edging toward a. scenario where lower temperatures last for the next four weeks. It is. going to be a contrast to the weather we have had this winter. Widespread frosts and snow could affect large areas.’ He said the wintry weather was a result of ‘a cold air mass moving across from Siberia’. There are fears that the sudden onset could bring travel chaos and catch many drivers off guard. AA. spokesman Luke Bodett said: ‘We have had a very mild winter so far and. motorists need to get into their winter mindset from today. It is going. to be important not to charge around in the way they may have been used. to and be prepared for the unexpected.’ The Met Office has briefed government. departments and local councils about the cold period so that extreme. weather plans can be put on standby.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many fewer students were in kindergarten or pre-school than in obligatory school and tertiary education combined?","completion":"Title: Comparing Enrolment Figures in Kindergarten or Pre-school with Obligatory School and Tertiary Education Combined Introduction Education is the key to personal and societal development, and governments across the globe strive to establish efficient and accessible education systems for their citizens. The enrolment pattern differs significantly across various stages of education, mainly due to the varying nature of the needs and the prestige associated with each level. This article aims to provide an overview of the discrepancy in the number of students enrolled in kindergarten or pre-school as compared to the combined enrolment in obligatory school and tertiary education. Kindergarten or Pre-school Education: The Foundation Kindergarten or pre-school education refers to the initial stage of structured education provided to children aged three to five years, before commencing primary school. This phase of education focuses mainly on developing cognitive, social, emotional, and physical skills through play-based learning. Though its importance is widely recognized for laying the groundwork for lifelong learning and overall development, enrolment in these early education settings is not universally mandated in many countries. Obligatory School and Tertiary Education: Scaling the Educational Ladder Obligatory school typically refers to primary and secondary education, also known as K-12 education in some regions. This education level is generally mandatory to ensure that all citizens receive a minimum level of education, equipping them with essential knowledge and skills. In most countries, it covers the age range from approximately six to sixteen or eighteen years. Tertiary education, also known as higher education or post-secondary education, follows obligatory education. It encompasses degrees, diplomas, and postgraduate studies, preparing individuals for professional and vocational careers. Discrepancy in Enrolment Figures Globally, enrolment figures can vary significantly based on factors such as countries' education policies, legislation, resources, and socio-economic context. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), there were about 184 million enrolments in pre-primary education in 2019. As per the data shared by the World Bank, approximately 1,410 million students were in primary and secondary education combined, while about 216 million students were enrolled in tertiary institutions. From these figures, it is evident that enrolment in kindergarten or pre-school is substantially lower than the combined enrolment in obligatory school and tertiary education. Specifically, there are approximately 1,626 million students enrolled in obligatory school and tertiary education combined (1,410 million in primary and secondary education plus 216 million in tertiary education). Thus, the number of students in kindergarten or pre-school is about 1,442 million fewer than those in the other mentioned levels. Reasons for Discrepancy There are several factors that contribute to this disparity in enrolments: 1. Legal Requirements: Unlike obligatory and tertiary education, kindergarten or pre-school education is not mandatory or required for entry into primary school in many countries, leading to lower enrolment rates. 2. Accessibility and Affordability: Pre-school education is often less accessible due to financial constraints or limited availability of institutions. In many developing countries, the costs of establishing and maintaining pre-schools are difficult to manage, forcing parents to focus more on ensuring their children attend mandatory education. 3. Cultural and Socio-Economic Factors: In some societies, the importance of early childhood education is not well-recognized, and families may prefer to dedicate resources to later stages of education. 4. Public and Private Investments: Governments often prioritize funding for obligatory and tertiary education, and private investments may reflect the same focus. Conclusion While the enrolment figures show that there are significantly fewer students in kindergarten or pre-school than in obligatory school and tertiary education combined, it is essential to acknowledge the importance of early childhood education in building a strong foundation for future learning. To bridge this gap, governments, communities, and individuals must work collaboratively to increase awareness and investment in pre-school education, ensuring that every child receives the best start possible in their education journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you realize that you have made a statement? Hold the glance for a second longer and you have made a different situation, there is a permissible time that you can hold a person's stare without being friendly, rude, or aggressive. If you are on a lift, what stare-time are you permitted? To answer this question, consider what you typically do. You very likely give other passengers a quick glance to size them up and to assure them that you mean no harm. Since being close to another person signals the possibility of interaction, you need to send out a signal telling others you want to be left alone. So you cut off eye contact----what sociologist Erving Goffiman calls \\"a dimming of the lights\\". You look down at the floor, at the indicator lights, anywhere but into another passenger's eyes. Should you break the rule against staring at a stranger on a lift, you will make the other person extremely uncomfortable, and you are likely to feel a bit strange yourself. If you hold eye contact for more than 3 seconds, what are you telling another person? Much depends on the person and the situation. For instance, a man and a woman communicate interest in this manner. They stare at each other for about 3 seconds at a time, and then drop their eyes down for 3 seconds, before letting their eyes meet again. But if one man gives another man a 3-second-plus stare, he signals, \\"I know you\\", \\"I am interested in you\\" or \\"You look peculiar and I am curious about you\\".

Given the question: After ten years, the world' s largest music festival, Rock in Rio, returned to its hometown Rio de Janeiro for seven days of concerts from Friday, September 23rd, attracting 700,000 people over the whole week. It is the 10th edition of the Rock in Rio festival, but only the 4th to be held in Rio as the organizers exported the festival to Lisbon and Madrid ten years ago.The first edition of the festival was in 1985 and the most recent edition in Rio was held in January, 2001.A total of 700,000 tickets were sold out for this year' s festival. The festival consists of four stages with the participation of International stars including Elton John, Katy Perry, and bands Metallica, Evanescence and System of a Down.Several stars which performed in previous editions are also on the list this year..In addition, a number of local singers and bands will also join this year. The performance site, named as Rock City, is a 150,000-square-meter area.Besides the concert area, the site also has a giant Ferns wheel, a roller coaster, and a small shopping mall.After the festival, the Rock City area will be converted into a leisure area to athletes in the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro According to Rio' s tourism company Riotur, out of the 700,000 people expected in the festival, some 315,000 will be tourists, who raised the hotels' occupation rate to 98 percent.Riotur estimated that the Rock in Rio festival will bring 419 million U.S.dollars for the city and create 10,000 jobs. The creator of the festival, Brazilian businessmen Roberto Medina, insisted on opening the Rock City gates himself, in the early afternoon, and greeted the first fans to enter the site.\\"We come to the gate because the Brazilian audience is even more important than the bands.We applaud them.They make the greatest show,\\" he said. From the passage, we can know _ . A) Rock City is a great theatre B) Only rock bands are invited to the festival? C) the festival will improve the employment of Rio D) The gate of Rock City was opened by the Brazilian audience The answer is:","completion":"C) the festival will improve the employment of Rio. To better explain, let's break down the details mentioned within the passage. Rock in Rio, the world's largest music festival, returned to its origin, Rio de Janeiro, after ten years. This is the event's 10th edition, and it was implemented over seven days starting from Friday, September 23rd, and continued for the entire week. The festival gathered an impressive crowd of around 700,000 people, selling out the same number of tickets. With four different stages for performances, the event boasted of global iconic figures in the music industry, such as Elton John, Katy Perry, Metallica, Evanescence, and System of a Down, among others. In addition to these international figures, local singers and bands were also a part of the grand event. The designated performance area, named Rock City, is a hefty 150,000-square-meter site which also includes numerous elements of entertainment like a Ferns wheel, roller coaster, shopping mall, etc. Interestingly, after the festival, the planners intend to repurpose the Rock City area into a recreational spot for athletes participating in the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. Surprisingly, out of the expected 700,000 festival-goers, the projection included 315,000 tourists. Due to this massive footfall, hotel occupancy rates skyrocketed to 98%. According to Riotur, Rio's tourism company, an estimated financial inflow of about 419 million U.S. dollars was anticipated from the festival, a significant boost to the city's economy. In addition to this, the festival created around 10,000 jobs, a substantial contribution to the city's employment index. This corroborates the answer picked from the given options, i.e., the festival will improve the employment of Rio. This statement justifies that the festival had a profound impact not only culturally, but economically and socially too, hugely improving employment opportunities within Rio.

The first statement simply describes a man with a red fringed shirt playing a banjo. This implies that there's at least one person playing an instrument but it gives us no clear information about any other characters, any group of people or any other context at all, let alone a group of band members or whether they are playing their instruments together.

It depends on additional context that was not provided in the first given statement. For the second sentence to be categorically related or considered true relative to the first sentence, it would need to directly reference the man with the red fringed shirt playing the banjo in some way. For example, \\"The man with the red fringed shirt is playing a banjo with several other band members.\\" Or, \\"Alongside the man with a red fringed shirt playing a banjo, several band members play their instruments together.\\" Otherwise, without any clear connections explicitly laid out, we cannot determine the truth of the second sentence based solely on the first sentence."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Studying Sea Life for a Glue That Mends People Top and bottom left: Fred Hayes/University of Utah; top and bottom right: Russell Stewart STICK-TO-IT-IVENESS Clockwise from top left, the sandcastle worm builds its home by using tentacles to grab sand and shell bits and glues them with adhesive from an organ on its head; its tube-shaped dwelling; two beads of a wormâs home, microscopically enlarged; a section of a sandcastle worm colony. It has the look of something that fell from outer space, but its origins are earthly, the intertidal waters of the California coast. It’s a home of sorts, occupied by a colony of Phragmatopoma californica, otherwise known as the sandcastle worm. Actually, it’s more of a condominium complex. Each hole is the entrance to a separate tube, built one upon another by worm after worm. P. californica is a master mason, fashioning its tube, a shelter that it never leaves, from grains of sand and tiny bits of scavenged shell. But it doesn’t slather on the mortar like a bricklayer. Rather, using a specialized organ on its head, it produces a microscopic dab or two of glue that it places, just so, on the existing structure. Then it wiggles a new grain into place and lets it set. What is most remarkable — and the reason these worms are in Dr. Stewart’s lab, far from their native habitat — is that it does all this underwater. “Man-made adhesives are very impressive,” said Dr. Stewart, an associate professor of bioengineering at the university. “You can glue airplanes together with them. But this animal has been gluing things together underwater for several hundred million years, which we still can’t do.” Dr. Stewart is one of a handful of researchers around the country who are developing adhesives that work in wet conditions, with worms, mussels, barnacles and other marine creatures as their guide. While there are many possible applications — the Navy, for one, has a natural interest in the research, and finances some of it — the biggest goal is to make glues for use in the ultimate wet environment: the human body. It is too early to declare the researchers’ work a success, but they are testing adhesives on animal bones and other tissues and are optimistic that their approaches will work. “I would have moved on to something else if I didn’t think so,” said Phillip B. Messersmith, a Northwestern University professor who is developing adhesives based on those made by mussels and is testing whether they can be used to repair tears in amniotic sacs, among other applications. While some skin sealants — mostly of the cyanoacrylate, or superglue, variety — are on the market, their effectiveness is limited. They often cannot be used, for example, on incisions where the skin is pulled or stretched, or must be used in tandem with sutures or staples. Adhesives strong enough to hold skin together under tension, or repair bone or other internal tissues — without inviting attack by the body’s immune system — have eluded researchers. Nature shows how it can be done, said J. Herbert Waite, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who did much of the early work of identifying the adhesives that mussels use to stick to rocks and other surfaces. But researchers should view nature’s approach as a general guide, he said, rather than a precise pathway. “In my view of bioinspired research or materials, I almost always don’t think it’s safe to be slavishly wed to the specific chemistry,” Dr. Waite said, “but rather to distill the important concepts that can then be mimicked.” So the goal of these researchers is not to duplicate natural adhesives that work well underwater, but to imitate them and make glues that are even better suited for humans. “We want to take elements of the structural adhesives that chemists have made and combine them with the unique elements that nature has used,” Dr. Stewart said. Synthetic adhesives might not only work better, but they should also be able to be produced in large quantities. Marine organisms make their glues in very small amounts — the typical dollop from a sandcastle worm, for example, is on the order of 100 picoliters. Even if it could somehow be collected before it set, it would take roughly 50 million dollops to make a teaspoon. “At the end of the day, the single biggest reason to do this is you can get more stuff,” said Jonathan Wilker, an associate professor of inorganic chemistry at Purdue University who works on analogues of mussel adhesives and studies oysters, barnacles and other organisms as well. But there are several hurdles to making glues that work underwater, Dr. Wilker said. “One is that whenever the surface is really wet, you’re going to be bonding to the surface layer of water, rather than the surface itself. So it’s going to lift off.” Another is that in order to cure, glues need a little water or none at all — they need to dry out.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the location of the structure that was built for Marquess of Annandale? Despite William Bruce's fall from political favour, and his intermittent imprisonment, he continued to practice. During the 1690s he completed Hill of Tarvit (1696), Craighall (1697–99) in Fife, and Craigiehall (1699) near Edinburgh. The latter, built for the Marquess of Annandale, still stands, and is used as the British Army's Scottish headquarters. From 1698 he was working on a new house for the young Charles Hope, later first Earl of Hopetoun. Hopetoun House, near Edinburgh, was completed in 1702, and represents Bruce's grandest country house design. The master mason was again Thomas Bauchop, and the inspiration was again Anglo-Dutch, with French rustication. The bulk of Bruce's work is now obscured by 18th-century remodelling, carried out by William Adam. Bruce was commissioned again by Hopetoun in 1708, to build a private aisle at Abercorn Kirk. The Hopetoun Loft overlooks the interior of the kirk, and connects to a retiring room with an oval \\"squint\\" giving a view of the pulpit.In 1702 Bruce was commissioned by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed until two years after Bruce's death, and the extent of his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed on the roof of the King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth.

Question: How many targets Max had Movie plot title: The Devil and Max Devlin Movie plot: Max Devlin (Elliott Gould) is a shady landlord of a rundown tenement in Los Angeles who is rather jaded and callous towards his fellow man. One day while chasing an errant tenant, he is run over by a bus and killed. He descends into hell (which resembles a corporate business) and meets the Devil's chief henchman Barney Satin (Bill Cosby). He is told of his life of sin and the fact that he is doomed to spend eternity at a section called Level 4. However, he is given a chance to save himself by convincing three other people to sell their souls in exchange for his. Max returns to Earth and begins his frantic quest with two months (ending on May 15) to complete his mission. Barney appears frequently throughout the movie to check up on Max's progress as well as both taunt and persuade him to carry out the plans. A running joke is that nobody, except Max, can see or hear Barney.In addition to being temporarily alive, Max soon learns that he casts no reflection when he looks into any mirror. Barney tells Max that by a signed contract his soul belongs to him unless he completes his mission. Barney further explains to Max the conditions to get the three young people to sell their souls before the deadline and that Max will be given limited mystical powers which are called \\"magic property\\" to convince his three targets that they have special talents. The magic property lasts only as long as Max and the subjects are within sight of each other. Once Max completes his mission, his soul will be free and the three subjects will continue to live until the natural end of their lives.Max's three targets are: Stella Summers (Julie Budd), a 19-year-old high school dropout and aspiring singer who has dreams to make it big; Nerve Nordlinger (David Knell), a 16-year-old high school geek whom has dreams to be popular by becoming a dirt motorbike champion racer; Toby Hart (Adam Rich) is an 11-year-old boy who dreams of having a father figure in his life in order to make his widowed mother, Penny (Susan Anspach), happy again.

It properly expresses the Pope's emphasis on his message. 2. \\"...with the closure of the Jubilee Year on January 6\\" - \\"...con el cierre del Año Jubilar el 6 de enero\\": In Spanish, the definite article ('el') is used before dates and 'Jubilee Year' translates to 'Año Jubilar' 3. \\"we have been left a precious legacy that must be passed on to future generations,\\" - \\"nos ha quedado un legado precioso que debe ser transmitido a las futuras generaciones,\\": 'nos ha quedado' and 'debe ser transmitido' are the respective translations of 'we have been left' and 'must be passed on' in Spanish.

Possible answers: she had a flat tire, have a car, she wanted exercise Answer:","completion":"Addison walked home from work after realizing she had a flat tire for a combination of reasons, which can be analyzed within the given context. Primarily, the flat tire was the impetus for her decision to walk home, as it rendered her car inoperable and left her unable to drive. The flat tire turned a usable mode of transportation into a temporary hindrance, forcing her to seek an alternative method to reach her destination. Another reason behind Addison's choice to walk home was her possession of a car, which implies that she typically relies on her vehicle as her primary mode of transportation. Owning a car means she is accustomed to driving to and from her workplace, running errands, and traveling to social engagements. As a car owner, Addison likely experiences a certain level of comfort and convenience when it comes to her daily transport needs. When faced with the unexpected issue of a flat tire, her routine was disrupted, and she needed an immediate solution to get home. Additionally, considering the circumstances, Addison may have decided to walk home as an opportunity for exercise. Walking is a healthy and environmentally friendly means of transportation that allows an individual to engage in physical activity and enjoy fresh air. If Addison typically spends most of her day commuting and working in a sedentary position, walking home could provide her with some much-needed movement and exercise. The act of walking might help alleviate stress and promote a positive mindset, as physical activity is known to release endorphins and enhance one's overall mood. In summary, Addison walked home from work as a result of the flat tire she encountered on her car. This unforeseen situation disrupted her normal routine of using her car as a means of transport and forced her to find an immediate alternative. Walking home not only addressed her need to reach her destination but also provided an opportunity for exercise and relaxation after a long day at work.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which team was more exposed to skin cancers? Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole. Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. The answer is:","completion":"In order to answer the question, let's break down the information given in the paragraph and hint: - Russian research team spent most of their time in Antarctica, where an ozone hole is mentioned. - Canadian research team spent several months north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole, where they didn't find any ozone holes.

Please answer the following question: In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation. I cleaned up, went to bed, and went back to London a few weeks later. But I cat proofed the house first. (Yes, they still lived with me for another 12 years before passing away.)

The story line moves - This indicates that the story has a pace and does not get monotonous or stuck at any point, which is a positive aspect. 2. There is not a lot of depth - This suggests that the story could use more complexity and development in terms of characters, emotions, or themes, which can be considered negative. 3. Beautiful setting - This implies that the reviewer appreciates the backdrop of the story, which is again a positive point. 4. Interesting time period - The reviewer also finds the temporal context engaging, adding another positive aspect to the review. The review contains both positive and negative elements, but it is not overwhelmingly negative or entirely critical.

Write highlights for this article: (CNN)Leonard Nimoy, whose portrayal of \\"Star Trek's\\" logic-driven, half-human science officer Spock made him an iconic figure to generations, died Friday. He was 83. Nimoy died this morning in Bel Air, California, his son Adam Nimoy told CNN. According to his granddaughter, Madeleine Nimoy, the cause of death was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His \\"Star Trek\\" co-stars, including William Shatner and George Takei, expressed sadness at his death. \\"We return you now to the stars, Leonard. You taught us to 'Live Long And Prosper,' and you indeed did, friend,\\" Takei wrote. Fans honor Nimoy with tweets, Vulcan salute. Nimoy's career in show business spanned more than six decades and included stints as a stage actor, television guest star, series regular and movie veteran. He also directed a handful of films, including the box-office hit \\"Three Men and a Baby\\" in 1987. He was a singer (of sorts), a published poet and an accomplished photographer. But his lasting claim to fame remains Spock, a native of the planet Vulcan whose pointed ears, unemotional manner and frequently uttered \\"fascinating\\" endeared him to millions. Astronaut Chris Hadfield remembered him as an \\"inspiration.\\" He felt a close connection to the character. \\"Spock is definitely one of my best friends. When I put on those ears, it's not like just another day. When I become Spock, that day becomes something special,\\" he told Starlog in 1989. Still, as an actor, he wrestled with the typecasting that came with his close association with Spock. He titled a 1975 memoir \\"I Am Not Spock.\\" Though the book was less a rejection of the character than what he went through to develop him, fans took umbrage. Twenty years later, he called another memoir \\"I Am Spock.\\" He maintained a sense of humor about being confused with a 23rd-century space voyager. \\"I had an embarrassing experience once, many years ago,\\" he told The New York Times in 2009. \\"I was invited to go to Caltech and was introduced to a number of very brilliant young people who were working on interesting projects. ... And they'd say to me, 'What do you think?' Expecting me to have some very sound advice. And I would nod very quietly and very sagely I would say, 'You're on the right track.' \\" To the stars. Leonard Simon Nimoy was actually born in Boston, far from Vulcan, on March 26, 1931. (His longtime \\"Trek\\" colleague, William Shatner, was born four days earlier in Montreal.) His parents were Russian immigrants, and he was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family. He incorporated some of his religious heritage into the \\"Star Trek\\" character, most notably the hand gesticulation accompanied by the phrase \\"Live long and prosper.\\" It was adopted from a blessing given by a Jewish priestly class called the kohanim. Nimoy credited writer Theodore Sturgeon for the phrase \\"Live long and prosper,\\" a variation of a spoken blessing. Nimoy continued to use the phrase long after his \\"Star Trek\\" days: On Twitter, he would close his tweets with the abbreviation \\"LLAP.\\" Upon graduating from high school, Nimoy acted in small productions. After encouragement from other actors, he applied to the Pasadena Playhouse in California and was accepted. He moved to the West Coast when he was 18. His early years were bumpy; he found the Playhouse \\"disappointing\\" and left after a few months and, in between roles, served in the military and took jobs such as driving a cab. Nimoy eventually gained steady work as a character actor, taking parts on such series as \\"Bonanza,\\" \\"The Twilight Zone\\" and \\"Dragnet.\\" It was a 1964 appearance on a show about Marines, \\"The Lieutenant,\\" that brought him to the attention of Gene Roddenberry, the show's producer. Nimoy in 2010: \\"I feel very fulfilled\\" with my work. Roddenberry had pitched a science-fiction series as \\" 'Wagon Train' to the stars\\" and liked the idea of casting Nimoy as the series' science officer, an alien originally with red-tinted skin. Nimoy got the part in the show, which was called \\"Star Trek.\\" (Roddenberry drew several other \\"Trek\\" performers from \\"The Lieutenant,\\" including Nichelle Nichols, Majel Barrett and future \\"Trek\\" guest star Gary Lockwood.) \\"Star Trek\\" was never a major hit during its original broadcast run. It lasted just three seasons and got the third partly because of an intense viewer lobbying campaign. But the characters became indelible: Shatner's gung-ho Capt. James T. Kirk; DeForest Kelley's wisecracking doctor, \\"Bones\\" McCoy; James Doohan's chief engineer, Montgomery \\"Scotty\\" Scott; and all the rest of a diverse and -- with the exception of the half-Vulcan Spock -- all-too-human crew. According to the Internet Movie Database, Nimoy made 1,250 an episode for \\"Trek's\\" first season. Though always popular with audiences -- Shatner remembered being disappointed that Nimoy got more fan mail than he did -- Spock wasn't a hit with network executives, at least at first. His pointed ears made him look satanic, the executives said, and his character was dry and logical, as opposed to the energetic Kirk. But Nimoy brought a much-needed humor to the character, with selectively raised eyebrows and deadpan delivery, and he quickly became a favorite of \\"Trek\\" fans. Nimoy even put out a few albums of songs. The character has entered the culture as an archetype of an unemotional intellectual; when New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd wants to criticize President Obama as being distant, she refers to him as Spock. Opinion: Nimoy is Spock, Spock is Nimoy. Into the movies. After three years, \\"Star Trek\\" went off the air. Nimoy quickly rebounded by joining the cast of \\"Mission: Impossible\\" as Paris, part of Peter Graves' secret-agent team. In the '70s, he made a few movies -- the most notable being the 1978 remake of \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" -- and a handful of TV guest appearances. He also hosted the syndicated show \\"In Search of ...\\" and appeared in a number of stage plays. But Spock was never far away. Despite its short original run, \\"Trek's\\" 79 episodes had become rerun gold after the show's cancellation, creating hardcore fans nicknamed \\"Trekkies\\" and bringing the voyages of the starship Enterprise to a new generation. The show was revived for a cartoon series in the mid-1970s. Then Hollywood came calling with a theatrical feature, 1979's \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture,\\" which reunited the original cast. Though the film garnered mixed reviews, it was a box-office success and led to a series of sequels, under the \\"Trek\\" banner, that continue to this day. The \\"Trek\\" movie series also gave Nimoy a chance to direct. He helmed both the third and fourth films, 1984's \\"The Search for Spock\\" (which takes place after the Spock character dies in the second film, though he's eventually revived) and 1986's \\"The Voyage Home.\\" Following \\"The Voyage Home,\\" Nimoy directed the biggest box-office hit of 1987, \\"Three Men and a Baby.\\" As a director, his other films include 1988's \\"The Good Mother\\" and 1990's \\"Funny About Love.\\" Though Spock kept Nimoy busy and well-employed, he found plenty of time for other endeavors. He received an Emmy nomination for the TV movie \\"A Woman Called Golda,\\" where he appeared with Ingrid Bergman. He lent his voice and appearance to one of the best-loved \\"Simpsons\\" episodes, \\"Marge and the Monorail,\\" in 1993 (and later was in 1997's \\"The Springfield Files\\"). He narrated documentaries, provided voice-over for video games and sent up his image in some commercials, including Priceline ads with his old friend Shatner and an Audi commercial with his movie successor as Spock, Zachary Quinto. \\"My heart is broken,\\" Quinto tweeted Friday. He also took roles in a few other TV series, notably in the paranormal series \\"Fringe\\" as Dr. William Bell. He lent his voice to Sentinel Prime in 2011's \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon.\\" Nimoy: \\"Fringe\\" cast impressed me the most. And he immersed himself in photography, a hobby he'd taken up as a teenager. His works include \\"Shekhina,\\" a controversial series of female nudes, and \\"The Full Body Project.\\" 'I would choose Spock' For all that, Nimoy knew how he'd be remembered. He hadn't left Spock behind, after all: He acted in the first two of the rebooted \\"Trek\\" movies, playing Spock Prime in 2009's \\"Star Trek\\" and 2012's \\"Star Trek Into Darkness.\\" He and the character were now on very good terms. \\"I am not Spock,\\" he wrote. \\"But given the choice, if I had to be someone else, I would be Spock. If someone said, 'You can have the choice of being any other TV character ever played,' I would choose Spock. I like him. I admire him. I respect him.\\" Nimoy married his wife, Susan Bay, in 1989. She survives him, as do his two children by his first wife, Sandra Zober. People we've lost in 2015.

Now in the year 2015 comes the first great parade in the 21stcentury. September 3rdis the 70thanniversary of the victory of the anti-fascist war. This day is considered as an important moment for China, as well as the world. 49 countries from all over the world, including South Korea and some European countries attended this special occasion. In preparation for the parade, the soldiers worked hard every day. In order to walk well in the three hundred meters distance on the Tian'anmen Square, they had to receive extremely strict training. Each day, they got up early in the morning and started the 10 hours' practice. When a reporter arrived, it was raining heavily outside, but none of the soldiers stopped training. Nothing can stop their training, and no one can stop their deep love to their motherland.

Determine the most likely category: - \\"Panzer Digest\\" doesn't sound like the name of a company or an album, as it doesn't represent a brand or focus on music. - The most fitting category for \\"Panzer Digest\\" would be \\"written work\\" because it implies a condensed or summarized collection of information, likely related to Panzer tanks or military history.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Q:James thought that the desk was built with solidity, but when he rapped on it he could hear what? - openness - instability - hollowness - strange sounds - weakness The best answer is A:","completion":"hollowness. This is because when James rapped on the desk, he would have felt a lack of density or a void, denoting that the structure is not solid or compact in nature, thus reflecting its holliness. The other terms do not convey the correct impression. An explanation of why each term is not appropriate is as follow: - openness: Openness is typically used to refer to the design or layout of larger objects or spaces, like rooms or buildings. It wouldn't be the right term to describe the physical makeup of a desk. - instability: Instability refers to the lack of stability, meaning it is unsteady or likely to change rapidly. Instability couldn't be determined by simply rapping on the desk. It could occur over time given certain conditions like uneven weight distribution or deterioration of the material. - strange sounds: Strange or unusual sounds might infer the desk is made from a rare or different material, or there might be something hidden in the desk that is causing the sound when rapped on it. Without more information, we couldn't conclude it's due to the nature of the material the desk is built from. - weakness: When we say something is weak, it means it is not strong or secure, and likely to break or fail under pressure. The weakness of the desk material wouldn't necessarily be determined by the sound it makes when rapped upon. The desk could be made of a strong material but still sound hollow. So all these options, based on the question provided, do not deliver the most appropriate connotation compared to 'hollowness'. The sense of emptiness or void inside the desk that resonates when rapped upon signals its hollowness, suggesting that there is a space within it, giving off a hollow sound, indicative of the desk not being as solid as it initially appeared to be. Note: the desk could still be sturdy or well-built, just not entirely solid, contributing to the mistaken perception James originally had."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

English jeweller and naturalist William Bullock and his son travelled to Mexico soon after its independence, spending six months in 1823 collecting archeological artifacts and many bird and fish species new to science. The bird specimens were given to naturalist William John Swainson, their countryman, to formally describe, which he did in 1827. Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus Setophaga, as Setophaga rubra. Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to Cardellina, with the red-faced warbler, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus Basileuterus, as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus. In 1873, English naturalists Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin moved the species to the genus Ergaticus, where it remained for more than a century.The red warbler forms a superspecies with the pink-headed warbler of Chiapas and Guatemala. Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages, the two have sometimes been considered conspecific. Conversely, it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray-eared species (C. melanauris) and a southern white-eared species (C. rubra). A comprehensive 2010 paper by Irby Lovette and colleagues analysing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the New World warblers found that the red and pink-headed warblers are each others' closest relative and that their common ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the red-faced warbler. The authors recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina, a suggestion which has been adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).There are three subspecies, which differ slightly in appearance: C. r. rubra, described by Swainson in 1827, has white ear patches and is found from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca.

Paragraph: We report antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus for certain dietary flavonoids and their likely biochemical mechanisms of action. Nine out of ten evaluated flavonoids blocked HCMV replication at concentrations that were significantly lower than those producing cytotoxicity against growing or stationary phase host cells. Baicalein was the most potent inhibitor in this series (IC 50 = 0.4-1.2 M), including positive control ganciclovir. Baicalein and genistein were chosen as model compounds to study the antiviral mechanism(s) of action for this series. Both flavonoids significantly reduced the levels of HCMV early and late proteins, as well as viral DNA synthesis. Baicalein reduced the levels of HCMV immediate-early proteins to nearly background levels while genistein did not. The antiviral effects of genistein, but not baicalein, were fully reversible in cell culture. Pre-incubation of concentrated virus stocks with either flavonoid did not inhibit HCMV replication, suggesting that baicalein did not directly inactivate virus particles. Baicalein functionally blocked epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity and HCMV nuclear translocation, while genistein did not. At 24 h post infection HCMV-infected cells treated with genistein continued to express immediate-early proteins and efficiently phosphorylate IE1-72. However, HCMV induction of NF-B and increases in the levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins-events that are associated with immediate-early protein functioning -were absent. The data suggested that the primary mechanism of action for baicalein may be to block HCMV infection at entry while the primary mechanism of action for genistein may be to block HCMV immediate-early protein functioning.

I have a new situation: Geologists have been contemplating on the question - why some places are more susceptible to earthquakes. To understand the differences, they have made a chart where they divided the earth into two regions, region A and region B. In region A many earthquakes happen, but in region B no earthquakes happen. But I can use this background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Would region B be near or further from a plate boundary? Answer:","completion":"Region B would be further from a plate boundary. Since almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries, the fact that no earthquakes are happening in Region B suggests that it is not located near an active plate boundary. At plate boundaries, the movement of tectonic plates causes stress to build up in the rocks, and the eventual release of this stress leads to earthquakes. In contrast, Region B seems to experience little to no such tectonic stress, indicating that it is located further away from plate boundaries where the risk of earthquakes is lower."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen)âinfamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War IIâand bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from Argentina and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. Both Stefan and David develop an attraction to Rachel. Rachel shows a preference for David, yet sleeps with Stefan shortly after David rebukes her advances. This tryst leads to Rachel becoming pregnant. Stefan also reveals to Rachel that David lost his entire family in The Holocaust. At a doctors appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a mail depot. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to collect the compromised Rachel.

Especially the time he caught Trisha bending over me in nothing but a frilly market stall thong while I worked the angles best I could to get a dangle-shot. Next night he took her in the car park woods and doped her up to the eyeballs. He took out a bottle of India ink and told her he would etch the love-heart she'd always wanted. Instead, he safety-pinned the word 'inbred' into her arse. Trisha's step-dad tracked the spits of blood and found her sobbing in the bathroom of their long-stay static. It didn't take him long to slap out the truth. He went straight round to Keith's place with a crow-bar and did enough damage to make sure he'd need more than laser treatment to put things right. Keith wasn't rolling in spare change so Trisha's step-dad took the Cortina as payment in lieu of her getting herself fixed up. Trisha got me to stash the Cortina up the lane at the back of Boyes' farm. Weekend nights, I drove her out to the dual carriageway truck-stop where she found a faster way to make her fortune in the fogged-up cabs. Question: who is trisha?

More and more mothers, clutching their rail-thin, malnourished children, are arriving at the packed waiting rooms of the Doctor Without Borders clinics in central Somalia, the aid group said. In fact, the group said it is treating 1,300 children in north and south Galcayo, which is almost half the number of children treated for malnutrition in the area all of last year. \\"The situation is alarming,\\" said Karin Fischer Liddle, head of the organization's mission in Somalia. \\"Our staff is stretched. This is the highest number of malnourished children MSF has ever treated in the area.\\" Doctors Without Borders -- widely known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres -- said the brutal mix of a lengthy drought, high food prices and insecurity from violence has caused a spike in malnutrition cases. Rain has come to the area in recent weeks, Fischer Liddle said, but it has caused more children to fall ill, leading to more malnutrition cases. In the long run, the rains may help the organization's overburdened clinics in the area. \\"Hopefully, the rains all over Somalia will cause food prices to drop and help some of these families,\\" Fischer Liddle said. She talked about a woman named Ubah who is at one of the nutrition centers that operate in hospitals in Galcayo.

After more two weeks, Ubah said, she saw improvement in her daughter, though she had not regained her sight. \\"They gave her fluid, vitamins and therapeutic food.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics). The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnar's 1909 play Liliom, transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. A film version of the musical was made in 1956, starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones. It follows the musical's story fairly closely, although a prologue, set in the Starkeeper's heaven, was added. The film was released only a few months after the release of the film version of Oklahoma!. It garnered some good reviews, and the soundtrack recording was a best seller. As the same stars appeared in both pictures, however, the two films were often compared, generally to the disadvantage of Carousel. Thomas Hischak, in The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, later wondered \\"if the smaller number of Carousel stage revivals is the product of this often-lumbering [film] musical\\". There was also an abridged (100 minute) 1967 network television version that starred Robert Goulet, with choreography by Edward Villella. The New York Philharmonic presented a staged concert version of the musical from February 28 to March 2, 2013, at Avery Fisher Hall. Kelli O'Hara played Julie, with Nathan Gunn as Billy, Stephanie Blythe as Nettie, Jessie Mueller as Carrie, Jason Danieley as Enoch, Shuler Hensley as Jigger, John Cullum as the Starkeeper, and Kate Burton as Mrs. Mullin. Tiler Peck danced the role of Louise to choreography by Warren Carlyle. The production was directed by John Rando. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote, \\"this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical as you are ever likely to hear.\\" It was broadcast as part of the PBS Live from Lincoln Center series, premiering on April 26, 2013. Was it popular?","completion":"Yes, Carousel was popular. The musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II received good reviews and gained a significant following for its time. The film version, released in 1956, starred the famous duo of Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones, which added to its popularity and success. As evident in Charles Isherwood's quote from The New York Times, \\"this is as gorgeously sung a production of this sublime 1945 Broadway musical as you are ever likely to hear,\\" Carousel was well-received and appreciated for its music and overall production. Moreover, the soundtrack recording of the film was a best-seller, which is another indication of the musical's popularity. Although Carousel was often compared to Oklahoma! and might have received less attention in terms of stage revivals, it still remains a popular and influential work in the world of musicals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. In 1980, Hunter was recruited to run for Congress in what was then the 42nd District against 18-year incumbent Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin. Hunter was initially an underdog in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 2 to 1. However, his attacks on Van Deerlin's record on national defense gained traction in a district dominated by military bases and personnel. Van Deerlin did not respond quickly enough, and Hunter narrowly defeated him. He was one of many Republicans swept into office from historically Democratic districts as a result of the \\"Reagan revolution\\"; Van Deerlin had been the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963. After the 1980 census, many of the more Democratic areas were cut out of Hunter's district, and he was reelected 13 more times with no substantive opposition. His district was renumbered as the 45th District in 1983 and the 52nd in 1993. In the 2006 general election, he defeated Navy veteran/minister John Rinaldi, a Democrat, and Michael Benoit, a Libertarian. Hunter was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote, a 33-point margin over Rinaldi. On March 20, 2007, Hunter announced that, as part of his presidential bid, he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 2008. After his son, Duncan D. Hunter, announced his candidacy for his father's seat, the younger Hunter was recalled by the United States Marine Corps to serve in the Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan. During Duncan D. Hunter's active service, his wife, Margaret Hunter, campaigned on his behalf. On June 3, 2008 Duncan D. Hunter won 72% of the Republican Primary vote and became the Republican nominee to replace his father representing the 52nd District.

Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971,..., can you guess it ? The answer is:","completion":"Boyd."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I loved my old comb better than my new brush, because the Choices: (a). comb is much flimsier.; (b). brush is much flimsier.;","completion":"I loved my old comb better than my new brush, because the brush is much flimsier. Let me elaborate on my reasoning further for an in-depth understanding of why I prefer the older one over the new one. When it comes to the materials used for the comb and the brush, my old comb was made of high-quality, long-lasting plastic, which could withstand daily usage. On the other hand, my new brush feels much cheaper and has a lower build quality, as it bends and deforms under the slightest pressure. Hence, the brush's flimsy nature makes me worry about its durability and whether it could last as long as the comb without breaking or losing its shape. In addition to the build quality, the design of the old comb also suited my requirements better. The comb featured wide, evenly-spaced teeth that easily glided through my hair, detangling the knots without causing discomfort or breakage. The bristles on the new brush, however, are less efficient at removing tangles. Due to their less sturdy nature, they have a tendency to bend and flex rather than really pulling through the hair, making it difficult for me to achieve a perfect and detangled hairstyle in a short time. Another advantage my old comb offered over the new brush is its ease of cleaning. The comb could be effortlessly washed and dried under the tap, whereas with the brush, the bristles tend to accumulate hair and residue over time, making it more challenging to clean thoroughly. Furthermore, the ergonomics of the old comb were better than that of the new brush. The comb had a wider handle that provided a comfortable grip, affording me better control over the styling process. The new brush, on the other hand, has a smaller handle, and the flimsy nature I mentioned earlier makes it harder to maneuver, thereby straining my hand during usage. Lastly, the comb was more convenient to carry around. Its slim design allowed me to easily slip it in my bag or pocket, making it a reliable travel companion. The new brush occupies more space and is relatively bulkier, making it a less convenient option to tote around daily or on trips. In conclusion, my preference for the old comb over the new, flimsy brush is based on several factors, including the comb's durability, build quality, efficiency in detangling, ease of cleaning, ergonomics, and portability. All these factors contribute to an overall better experience using the old comb compared to the new brush. Each of these attributes make it a more reliable and suitable choice for my everyday hair care needs and routines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Agnieszka Szefler's body was discovered at the property in Bridge of Earn, near Perth, in January 2015. She had gone to pick up her possessions after her relationship broke up. The Polish citizen's former partner Mohammed Ali Abboud denies murdering Ms Szefler. He also denies trying to cover up the crime. On the first day of the trial, the High Court in Edinburgh heard from Ms Szefler's friend Aleksandra Pruszak, who said she had spoken to the 27-year-old on the morning of her death on 23 January. Mrs Pruszak said Ms Szefler had left Scotland to take a teaching job in Kuwait, which was when her relationship with Mr Abboud ended. She told prosecution lawyer Sheena Fraser that Ms Szefler flew to Edinburgh Airport on the morning of 23 January. The teacher was going to pick up belongings from the house at Bridge of Earn, but she first visited Mrs Pruszak in Perth at about 11:00 the same morning to collect some boxes and a suitcase for her possessions. The court heard that as the day progressed, Mrs Pruszak sent texts and made a number of calls to Ms Szefler's mobile phone. She told Ms Fraser: \\"I tried to contact her but she didn't reply. She didn't answer my calls.\\" Prosecutors allege that Mr Abboud assaulted Mr Szefler by biting her and \\"striking her repeatedly\\" with a knife.

This revelation points towards the persistent questions surrounding the integrity and credibility of the police force when handling such sensitive cases. Why this is important Stephen Lawrence, a British teenager, was murdered in an unprovoked racially motivated attack back in 1993. The case, and the subsequent police handling of it, caused widespread outrage and led to significant public discussions on race relations, racism, and the police handling of racially motivated crimes. The case was already heartbreaking and complex, but if the allegations of police corruption during the investigation of Lawrence's murder are proven to be true, it could have a considerable impact on public trust and confidence in law enforcement. This recent investigation probes further into the question of whether justice was indeed served in the Stephen Lawrence case. The Investigation The ongoing investigation aims to delve into the truth behind the actions of police officers involved in the case. It is tasked with uncovering whether there were any instances of corruption by law enforcement officials, which might have potentially hampered the course of justice for Stephen Lawrence. This investigation was initiated after a series of historical allegations came to light, implicating police officers in misconduct and corruption. These allegations could have potential implications on the outcome of the case, had they been presented during the initial proceedings. Impact on the institution Should the allegations of police corruption be proven true, the effects could be far-reaching. At the heart of this issue is public trust in law enforcement. Incidences of police corruption shake the faith of the public in the ability of police to carry out their duties responsibly and fairly. The possible impact of this investigation also extends to race relations within the UK. The Stephen Lawrence case was seminal in initiating discussions about institutional racism. If it comes to light that law enforcement was indeed engaged in misconduct during the course of this investigation, this might further fuel the conversation about systemic racism within institutions like the police. Moving Forward This recent announcement of an investigation brings both controversy and hope. On one hand, the allegations of corruption are indeed disconcerting, particularly because they relate to such a high-profile and sensitive case. On the other hand, this investigation may pave the way for necessary corrections and reforms within the police system, bringing further transparency and accountability in its wake. In conclusion, the ongoing investigation into allegations of police corruption during the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry could bring about significant changes. It underscores the necessity for vigilance, transparency, and checks and balances in our law enforcement agencies. Regardless of the investigation's findings, one point stands clear: the pursuit of justice, fairness, and upholdment of law and order remains of paramount importance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The town was always bustling with joy and celebration, with people relishing every opportunity to gather and have a good time. Camila, despite her otherwise creative and adventurous spirit, was an introvert at heart who had never really enjoyed these jubilant events. She often felt overwhelmed by the cacophony of sounds, conversations, and the taxing efforts needed to socialize. One day, as Camila was walking back from her favorite art supplies store, her close childhood friend, Lucy, bumped into her. With a gleeful smile, Lucy told her about a grand party that was being organized by their mutual friend, Jake, to celebrate his recent promotion in one of the best marketing companies in town. Camila, despite her usual reluctance to attend parties, couldn't help but feel tempted to go after hearing how excited Lucy was. When the night of the party arrived, Camila spent hours preparing herself, trying to make sure that she would look her best and hopefully feel comfortable amidst the crowd. As she arrived at Jake's house, the booming music filled her ears, and people around her laughed and danced. Despite the apprehension bubbling up inside her, she was ready to experience this party alongside her friends. The first few hours went by in a whirlwind of chattering and polite smiling, with Camila catching up with old acquaintances and reminiscing about past memories. She didn't feel as out of place as she imagined she would, and her confidence grew. Just as she was starting to relax and enjoy herself, someone at the party suggested they play a game as a way to liven everyone's spirits. It was at this point that Camila's evening took a turn for the worse. The game, which seemed harmless at first, slowly became personal, forcing the participants to reveal their deepest secrets and insecurities in front of everybody. Camila watched in horror as her friends revealed embarrassing and painful things about themselves, crumbling under the weight of peer pressure, and unexpected competitiveness to outdo one another. When it reached Camila's turn, she hesitated, unable to bear the thought of exposing her vulnerabilities to others. As the stress of the situation reached its peak, tears filled her eyes, and she sprinted out of the room, desperately seeking refuge from the oppressive atmosphere. Outside, in the cold night air, she struggled to catch her breath, feeling the weight of the social norms and expectations that had driven everyone to share their secrets much for others' amusement. Camila couldn't comprehend the thought process behind it all, why it was considered fun, or how others had so easily consented to play along. That night, not only did Camila experience a side of her friends she had never seen before, but she also uncovered a harsh reality about what society often regards as entertainment and camaraderie. This revelation tore at her soul and shattered the sense of comfort she had developed around her friends. She vowed within her heart that she would never again partake in such activities, for they not only affected her wellbeing, but also made her question the world she lived in. After a few long and intense moments, Camila gathered herself together, walked back into the party, and graciously said her farewells. She drove home, physically and emotionally drained by the events of the night, feeling a mixture of sadness and determination as her house came into view. When she came home, she fell asleep immediately, exhausted."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The Eastern Roman Empire – today conventionally named the Byzantine Empire, a name not in use during its own time – became increasingly influenced by Greek culture after the 7th century, when Emperor Heraclius (AD 575 - 641) decided to make Greek the empire's official language. Certainly from then on, but likely earlier, the Roman and Greek cultures were virtually fused into a single Greco-Roman world. Although the Latin West recognized the Eastern Empire's claim to the Roman legacy for several centuries, after Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne, king of the Franks, as the \\"Roman Emperor\\" on 25 December 800, an act which eventually led to the formation of the Holy Roman Empire, the Latin West started to favour the Franks and began to refer to the Eastern Roman Empire largely as the Empire of the Greeks (Imperium Graecorum).

Vice President Cheney called Crown Prince Abdullah on July 5, 2001, to seek Saudi help in preventing threatened attacks on American facilities in the Kingdom. Secretary of State Powell met with the crown prince twice before 9/11. They discussed topics like Iraq, not al Qaeda.U.S.-Saudi relations in the summer of 2001 were marked by sometimes heated disagreements about ongoing Israeli- Palestinian violence, not about Bin Laden. The confirmation of the Pentagon's new leadership was a lengthy process. Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was confirmed in March 2001 and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith in July. Though the new officials were briefed about terrorism and some of the earlier planning, including that for Operation Infinite Resolve, they were focused, as Secretary Rumsfeld told us, on creating a twenty-first-century military. At the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton did not recall much interest by the new administration in military options against al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He could not recall any specific guidance on the topic from the secretary. Brian Sheridan-the outgoing assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low-intensity conflict (SOLIC), the key counterterrorism policy office in the Pentagon-never briefed Rumsfeld. He departed on January 20; he had not been replaced by 9/11. Rumsfeld noted to us his own interest in terrorism, which came up often in his regular meetings with Tenet. He thought that the Defense Department, before 9/11, was not organized adequately or prepared to deal with new threats like terrorism. But his time was consumed with getting new officials in place and working on the foundation documents of a new defense policy, the quadrennial defense review, the defense planning guidance, and the existing contingency plans. He did not recall any particular counterterrorism issue that engaged his attention before 9/11, other than the development of the Predator unmanned aircraft system. The commander of Central Command, General Franks, told us that he did not regard the existing plans as serious. To him a real military plan to address al Qaeda would need to go all the way, following through the details of a full campaign (including the political-military issues of where operations would be based) and securing the rights to fly over neighboring countries. The draft presidential directive circulated in June 2001 began its discussion of the military by reiterating the Defense Department's lead role in protecting its forces abroad.

What are the advantages and disadvantages of having one's mother tongue as the medium of instruction during primary education in India? How would India be today if English were not the medium of instruction in higher education? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"The two questions you have asked are related, but they are not the same. The first one focuses on the mother tongue as the medium of instruction during primary education in India, whereas the second one speculates on the situation in India if English were not the medium of instruction in higher education. I will address both questions separately: 1. Advantages and disadvantages of having one's mother tongue as the medium of instruction during primary education in India: Advantages: a) Cultural values: When children learn in their mother tongue, it helps in preserving cultural heritage and values. Language is not only a means of communication, but also a carrier of tradition and cultural identity. b) Easier comprehension: Children are more comfortable and have a better understanding of concepts in their mother tongue. Learning in the native language makes it easier for them to grasp new ideas and improve their learning process. c) Better cognitive development: Studies have shown that children who learn in their mother tongue develop better cognitive skills. They tend to be more creative, have a richer vocabulary, and have better problem-solving abilities. d) Strengthening linguistic diversity: India is a country with a vast linguistic diversity. Encouraging the mother tongue as a medium of instruction will help in the development and promotion of regional languages. Disadvantages: a) Limited resources: Due to the vast number of languages in India, having the mother tongue as the primary medium of instruction requires a considerable amount of resources for textbooks, learning materials, and well-trained teachers in each language. b) Barrier to national integration: Language can sometimes act as a barrier in a diverse society like India. Having various mother tongues as a medium of instruction may result in regionalism, and students might feel alienated when they move to a different part of the country for higher education or job opportunities. c) Difficulty in transitioning to English: As most professional courses and higher education are taught in English, students who have been taught primarily in their mother tongue might find it challenging to adapt to English as the medium of instruction later on. 2. How would India be today if English were not the medium of instruction in higher education? It's speculative, but if English were not the medium of instruction in higher education in India, there might be a few potential outcomes: a) Limited access to global knowledge: Since a significant portion of the world's scientific research, literature, and technical information is available in English, lack of exposure to the language could potentially hinder the access to global knowledge available in the domain. b) Reduced job opportunities: Many multinational companies require a working knowledge of English. If English were not the medium of instruction, graduates might face challenges in securing employment in such organizations. c) Adverse impact on the IT sector: India's IT sector is one of the largest contributors to its economy, and English has played a crucial role in its growth. Without English, it might become challenging to collaborate and communicate with global clients, which could negatively impact the IT sector and overall economy. d) Reduced cultural exchange: If English were not the medium of instruction in higher education, it might, to some extent, limit the opportunities for students to study abroad and engage in academic and cultural exchanges with students from other countries. It is important to note that while these are possibilities, there can be strategies to mitigate the potential negative impacts without compromising on the importance of regional languages. In conclusion, both questions address different aspects of the role of language as a medium of instruction in India. While promoting regional languages has its benefits, it is crucial to find a balanced approach that ensures linguistic preservation without hindering academic and professional opportunities for the students."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As they are settling into a flat, we learn explicitly that Frankie is deaf.We hear Frankie's voice over as he writes a letter to his father, Petty Officer Davey Morrison, care of his ship the Accra. It's clear Frankie is a frequent letter-writer, with a stamp collection supplied from his correspondent -- which, it turns out is his mother. Frankie's father is clearly not on the scene, and from Nell's reaction to a personal ad seeking Lizzie, it's clear the family is anxious to avoid being found.At a new school (again) Frankie suffers some predictable petty bullying, and some counter-balancing friendship from another classmate, Catriona (Jayd Johnson). Frankie agrees to a bet with the chief pest, Ricky Munroe (Sean Brown), who asserts that Frankie's Da won't show up when the ship arrives.Desperate as the day of the ship's arrival nears, Lizzie embarks on a pick-up outing to the local pub, but quickly leaves, disgusted and distraught. When Lizzie admits her predicament -- to find a total stranger to act as Frankie's Da for one day -- to her friend (and boss) Marie, Marie provides her a name and number. Lizzie meets the man, and when he agrees to the charade she hands him all the letters from Frankie to his Da.Early the day the ship is due, Frankie bolts out of the flat and goes missing for hours. His surrogate Da is at the flat when Frankie returns. He gives Frankie a book that is somewhat skeptically received, until he tells Frankie that chose it based on what he read in Frankie's letters. Frankie's face lights up, and he runs to embrace the man.At the football tryouts, Frankie delightedly claims the spoils of his bet from Ricky Munroe. The stranger and Frankie spend the rest of the day slowly getting acquainted, by the harbor. Frankie and the man ask Lizzie for one more day, which she...

Given the question: Information: - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland. - Drake Tungsten was the pseudonym that singer / songwriter Britt Daniel performed under from 1994 to 1996 as a solo artist . - Austin is the capital of the U.S. state of Texas and the seat of Travis County. It is the city in the U.S. and the in Texas. It is the fastest growing city in the United States and the second most populated capital city after Phoenix, Arizona. As of the U.S. Census Bureau's July 1, 2015 estimate, Austin has a population of 931,830. Located in in the foothills of Texas Hill Country, the city is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways including Lady Bird Lake, Barton Springs, McKinney Falls, the Colorado River, Lake Travis, and Lake Walter E. Long. It is the cultural and economic center of the metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 2,064,149 as of June 1, 2016. - John Britt Daniel (born April 14, 1971) is the co-founder, lead singer and guitarist of the Austin, Texas, rock band Spoon and the co-founder, guitarist, bassist, and singer of the band Divine Fits. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.

In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns into sand. When spring comes and the ice melts, the ground becomes loose. Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Besides, in northeast China, there is some vast desert. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe in too much sand, they will cough or have serious illnesses. Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never come back home. The winds also tear the farmers' houses down. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's a piece of advice.

Question: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step in this process is the formation of a fossil, the preservation of the organism's remains, and ultimately, its discovery and study by scientists. After the mineralization process, where the remaining organic structure is replaced with minerals, the once-living organism has been transformed into a stable and durable fossil, ready to withstand the test of time. This fossil will now consist of minerals that have taken the shape and structure of the original organism, preserving its physical characteristics even after millions of years. These fossils serve as important evidence of past life forms and ecosystems, providing valuable information for scientists studying ancient environments and evolution. As geological processes continue, tectonic movements, weathering, and erosion may bring the fossil closer to the Earth's surface or alter the surrounding rock layers. Eventually, a series of environmental events, such as heavy rains, landslides, or human activities like construction, may unearth the fossil and expose it on the surface, making it accessible for discovery. Once discovered, paleontologists and other scientists can study the fossil to learn more about the organism it represents, including its age, appearance, and the environment in which it lived. Fossil analysis and comparison may shed light on the evolution, extinction, and diversification of ancient organisms and the ecosystems they inhabited. Furthermore, the fossil may help scientists understand the causes of environmental shifts and provide valuable information on how Earth's climate has changed over time. In summary, the last step in this process is the formation of a fossil. The preserved organism's remains may then be discovered and examined by researchers, providing valuable insights into the history of life on Earth, evolution, and ancient ecosystems. Fossils have a crucial role in helping to unravel the mysteries of our planet's past and enable us to learn from previous environmental changes to better understand and potentially prepare for future changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person whose house replaced an elegant, Georgian-style homestead? Answer the above question based on the context below: Yarralumla is a large inner south suburb of Canberra, the capital city of Australia. Located approximately 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) south-west of the city, Yarralumla extends along the south-west bank of Lake Burley Griffin. (The lake was created after the Second World War through the blocking, with a dam, of the Molonglo River.) In 1828, Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant, was granted a lease on the western side of Stirling Ridge. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834, apparently after the indigenous people's term for the area. It was also spelt Yarrolumla in other documents. In 1881, the estate was bought by Frederick Campbell, grandson of Robert Campbell who built nearby \\"Duntroon\\". He completed the construction of a large, gabled, brick house on his property in 1891 that now serves as the site of Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia. Campbell's house replaced an elegant, Georgian-style homestead, the main portions of which were erected from local stone in the 1830s. Among the old Yarralumla homestead's most notable occupants were Sir Terence Aubrey Murray, who owned Yarralumla sheep station from 1837 to 1859, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, who owned the property from 1859 to 1881, and Augustus' father Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873). (Augustus \\"Gussie\\" Gibbes was Murray's brother-in-law; he also advanced money to Frederick Campbell to assist with the construction, in 1890–1891, of Campbell's grand new family house at Yarralumla.) The modern suburb of Yarralumla was gazetted by the government in 1928 and as of 2011 was home to approximately 3,000 people and many diplomatic missions. In recent years, it has become one of Canberra's most desirable and expensive residential suburbs because of its wide leafy streets, attractive lakeside setting and central location.

We need to classify our answer as one of the given options: a) 6, b) 3, c) 4, d) 4.5, e) 2. Step 2: Convert all measurements to the same unit (meters and meters per hour). Since the given speed is in kmph (kilometers per hour), we need to convert this to meters per hour. 1 km = 1,000 meters 60 kmph = 60 * 1,000 meters per hour = 60,000 meters per hour Step 3: Calculate the total length of the train. The total length of the train includes 50 carriages and an engine, all with a length of 60 meters. Total train length = (50 carriages + 1 engine) * 60 meters = 51 * 60 meters = 3,060 meters Step 4: Calculate the total distance the train needs to travel to cross the bridge completely. The total distance includes the length of the bridge and the length of the train.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. I am facing a new situation today: Rob is studying medicine in a prestigious university. Today, his professor is teaching about blood glucose levels. He gave example of two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had high blood glucose level, but patient B had low blood glucose level. Rob was amazed to find how body keeps its balance. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which patient is more likely to produce the hormone glucagon, patient A or patient B?

The film opens with the mirroring of a gloomy sky on the placid Baltic Sea waters at the Faro Island shores, near Gotland's northernmost tip. Four bathers, all in a jovial mood, splashing and joking, are returning from a swim in the cold sea. As they reach the jetty, the youngest members of the quartet, Karin (Harriet Andersson) and her teenage brother, Fredrik, known as Minus (Lars Passgard), are sent off to get some milk at a nearby farm, while Karin's physician husband, Martin (Max von Sydow), and her father, David (Gunnar Bjorstrand), a writer, go and set up their fishing nets. David has just returned from Switzerland, where he was finishing writing his latest novel, and their task gives them a private opportunity to discuss Karin's status, whose schizophrenia has been diagnosed as most likely incurable.On the way to the farm, Minus expresses his hope that their father will be successful with his latest novel's publication. On the way back, Minus confides in his sister his sexual apprehensions, which eventually degenerates into his admonishment of Karin for the (maybe) too intimate attention she keeps showing toward him. But most importantly, he confesses how much he wishes he could communicate with his father.The quartet is reunited for the evening dinner around a table in front of their cottage. Again, a festive atmosphere prevails, but soon turns sour. David confesses that while he was anxious to return to his family after his long absence, that he is about to leave again, in spite of his earlier promise to his children not to travel so often. Somewhat guiltily, and seeking forgiveness, David distributes some presents, all of them turning out to be unsuitable.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Let’s rewind to January 2013 for a moment. It’s a sunny and warm day in Los Angeles—a bit of a weather shock to me after 11 years of Seattle’s cold and rain. I’ve been officially on the job in the web department for all of 12 hours. I’m sitting in a conference room at a big wooden table, surrounded by my new coworkers and team members in the Getty’s web group. A big monitor is displaying the prototype of the newly designed and almost-built Getty Iris. We’re discussing The Iris logo you see at the top of this page, its multiple iterations, and, quite frankly, the pain involved in trying to get it to look right. Wait-wait-wait, let’s pause for a moment. My name is Will Lanni. I’m a Web production specialist at the Getty, which is a complex way of saying I’m a developer and designer, which is a nice way of saying that I’m basically a “web monkey.” Before I started at the Getty, I worked as a partner in a small web design and development firm for several years. I had some experience working for the Getty—I built the Pacific Standard Time at the Getty site, the Pacific Standard Time Festival site, as well as the interactive Getty Impact map. And, at the time of my hiring, I was not only working on the new design and build of The Iris, due to go live in only a month, but also the soon-to-be-launched website for Pacific Standard Time Presents: Modern Architecture in L.A. So I wasn’t exactly new to projects at the Getty, even though I was a brand-spanking-new full-time employee. OK. Now that you know who I am, let’s get back to that moment. The Iris logo, and the hair-pulling it was causing for all of us—which is a pretty good representation of the steps that Web projects go through as we move from idea, to execution, to setback, to solution.

I will focus on sources that offer recent, updated, and accurate information. Step 2: Analyzing the information. Once I gather enough data, I will analyze the information to identify the top cotton-producing countries, specifically looking at their percentage share in global cotton production.

Step 4: Presenting the information. Finally, I will present the top cotton-producing country or countries responsible for most of the world's cotton production. After conducting research and following these steps, I have found that the majority of the world's cotton comes from: 1.

Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year. After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year. Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe.","completion":"The text is about Duke Ellington, an American composer, pianist, and leader of a jazz orchestra, who had a significant influence on the history of jazz."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A local black attorney complained in Time that the new city administration did not have enough time to confer with the various groups invested in changing the city's segregation policies. Black hotel owner A. G. Gaston agreed. A white Jesuit priest assisting in desegregation negotiations attested the \\"demonstrations [were] poorly timed and misdirected\\".Protest organizers knew they would meet with violence from the Birmingham Police Department and chose a confrontational approach to get the attention of the federal government. Wyatt Tee Walker, one of the SCLC founders and the executive director from 1960 to 1964, planned the tactics of the direct action protests, specifically targeting Bull Connor's tendency to react to demonstrations with violence: \\"My theory was that if we mounted a strong nonviolent movement, the opposition would surely do something to attract the media, and in turn induce national sympathy and attention to the everyday segregated circumstance of a person living in the Deep South.\\" He headed the planning of what he called Project C, which stood for \\"confrontation\\". Organizers believed their phones were tapped, so to prevent their plans from being leaked and perhaps influencing the mayoral election, they used code words for demonstrations.The plan called for direct nonviolent action to attract media attention to \\"the biggest and baddest city of the South\\". In preparation for the protests, Walker timed the walking distance from the 16th Street Baptist Church, headquarters for the campaign, to the downtown area. He surveyed the segregated lunch counters of department stores, and listed federal buildings as secondary targets should police block the protesters' entrance into primary targets such as stores, libraries, and all-white churches.

Small-time rancher Dan Evans (Van Heflin) and his two young sons, Mark (Jerry Hartleben) and Mathew (Barry Curtis), are on horseback looking for their errant cattle. Dan hears the cattle over the ridge, and they ride over to where they can see the robbery in progress. Dan waits for the dust to settle, but the robbers spot him, and their leader, Ben Wade (Glenn Ford), tells him to stay where he is--he'll get his cattle back in five minutes.As one of the robbers passes down the gold, the driver, Bill Moons (Boyd Stockman), draws his own gun and grabs the man as a shield.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Expressing emotions is important rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. Everyone feels negative emotions such as anger and needs to deal with them. But there are healthy ways to express anger and ways to control it. Shouting bad words at someone will hurt the other person or make them angry too. If you feel angry, it is best to think before you speak. Some people in the UK use the expression \\"take a deep breath and count to 10\\", meaning take a pause, breathe deeply and let yourself calm down instead of getting angry. Another expression people use to say they are controlling their anger is \\"biting their lip\\". This means not letting the bad words come out of their mouth. If you cannot think of anything but bad words, it is probably best to \\"bite your lip.\\" But sometimes letting all your anger out can be cathartic , as long as you do it at the right place and time. If you have just had a bad day, you could go into a room by yourself and scream or yell very loudly. Or if you want to hit someone or smash something, you could hit a pillow instead. Then after you let your frustration out this way, you'll be able to deal with your problems more calmly. If you do lose your temper with someone and swear at them, though, you need to apologize. One way to do this is to say \\"pardon my French\\". This expression has been used for many years as an apology for bad language. Then you can calmly explain what made you upset. Question: How does this passage view expressing emotions? Answer: A:","completion":"This passage views expressing emotions as important, rather than hiding them or keeping them inside. It emphasizes the need for dealing with negative emotions, such as anger, in a healthy way. The passage suggests thinking before speaking, using expressions like \\"take a deep breath and count to 10\\" or \\"biting your lip\\" to control anger, and finding appropriate ways to let out frustration, such as screaming in a private room or hitting a pillow.

Here, make sure that the changes are semantically related and syntactically similar to the input. And the generated sentence should have high commonsense plausibility, that is to have reasonable probability of it being true. А кошница с дръжка е по-лесно да се вземе.","completion":"Task Explanation: This task requires generating a new Bulgarian sentence based on an existing Bulgarian sentence by making small, yet contextually appropriate, changes. The new sentence should maintain the overall grammatical structure of the original and also align with the semantic context. Additionally, the revised sentence must have high plausibility, meaning it should sound reasonably true or likely, thus maintaining commonsense. Guidelines to Follow: 1. Understand the meaning: First, it is crucial to comprehend the meaning of the given Bulgarian sentence, \\"А кошница с дръжка е по-лесно да се вземе\\". It translates to \\"A basket with a handle is easier to take\\". 2. Plan changes: Next step is to brainstorm related concepts you might alter in the sentence. Semantically related elements to \\"basket\\" could be other items that could have handles and can be taken/carried - such as a bag, a cup, a suitcase, etc. The key is to choose a concept that makes sense in the context of being 'easier to take/carry' with a handle. 3. Implement changes: Now, change the required elements in the sentence, ensuring that the sentence's grammatical structure remains intact. For instance, changing \\"кошница\\" (basket) to \\"чанта\\" (bag), we get \\"А чанта с дръжка е по-лесно да се вземе\\" which translates to \\"A bag with a handle is easier to take\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: What should I do if a guy is not committed with me but though we are in sexual attachment? Question 2: I am in a relationship of three years with my girlfriend and wish to marry her but her parents don't approve of me. We are from the same caste and community. Her parents are threatening her to break up with me or they'll commit suicide due to which she is now too scared to continue with me. What should I do? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are two separate situations with unique elements and entail different approaches in addressing the respective concerns. Question 1 is related to an individual who is having a sexual relationship with someone that is not committing on an emotional level or in terms of a serious relationship. In this situation, a possible course of action would be to: 1. Reflect on your own feelings and expectations: Determine if you are looking for a committed relationship or if you are fine with a casual arrangement. Knowing what you want will make addressing the situation easier. 2. Communicate openly: Talk to the person involved about your feelings, expectations, and concerns. Honest communication is crucial for understanding each other's perspectives, thereby setting the foundation for a decision moving forward. 3. Set boundaries: Establish clear boundaries that protect your emotional and physical well-being. It's crucial not to allow someone to take advantage of your feelings, and setting boundaries can help to prevent this. 4. Evaluate the relationship: Assess whether the relationship is positively affecting your life, providing you with emotional growth, and adequately fulfilling your emotional needs. If it isn't, it may be best to move on. 5. Seek professional advice: In case the situation becomes overwhelming, consider consulting a therapist or counselor to help process your feelings and guide you in making well-informed decisions. Question 2 pertains to a person in a long-term relationship facing significant external pressures due to their partner's parents' disapproval. The issue stems from the girlfriend's parents threatening to commit suicide if the relationship continues, despite sharing the same caste and community. In this scenario, the possible course of action would be: 1. Communication and understanding: Talk to your girlfriend openly about the situation, understanding her feelings, fears, and perspectives. Listen to her concerns and share your thoughts on how to handle the situation together. 2. Respect her decisions: It's essential to stand by your girlfriend's side while also respecting her decision-making process. Understand that she faces tremendous pressure and that any decision made should involve both parties' consent. 3. Seek a mediator: Consider seeking help from a trusted family member, friend, or community member who can help mediate or facilitate a conversation between the two families to help them understand your bond and intentions better. 4. Build a supportive framework: Focus on strengthening your relationship with your girlfriend and maintain emotional security, ensuring a steady support system outside her family. 5. Consider professional help: If the situation continues to escalate, both you and your girlfriend should contemplate seeking therapy or counseling to help in dealing with the emotional turmoil and guide you on your next steps. In summary, while both questions touch upon relationship complications, the underlying issues and possible solutions in each case are distinct, making them separate inquiries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We are big supporters of buying locally and we are here to tell you why it is so important for your family, the community and the environment. The concept of buying locally is simple: buy food produced, grown, or raised as close to your home as possible. Not only will your food be fresher and tastier, but you are helping protect the environment and are supporting businesses within your community and reducing pollution. Better for the environment Sustainability and global warming are such hot topics at the moment, and many people want to do their bit to help support a healthier environment. Small action carried out by many people can make a big difference. Most materials in an average North American meal have traveled about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate. To cut out a big part of this travel would greatly reduce not only pollution from transportation and refrigeration but also customers' expenses as well. Taste and nutritional content Locally-grown fruits and vegetables are usually sold within 24 hours of being harvested. Because they are picked at the height of ripeness and travel only a short distance to the market, their freshness, nutrition, and flavor are kept. Produce trucked in from far away may lose both taste and nutritional content. Community and home values When you buy direct from a farmer or buy locally-grown foods, you are engaged in a time-honored tradition between a grower and an eater.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Information: - The Master of Business Administration (MBA or M.B.A.) is a master's degree in business administration (management). The MBA degree originated in the United States in the early 20th century when the country industrialized and companies sought scientific approaches to management. The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as accounting, finance, marketing, human resources, and operations in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy. Most programs also include elective courses. - The Doctor of Business Administration (abbreviated DBA or D.B.A.) is a research doctorate awarded on the basis of advanced study and research in the field of business administration. The D.B.A. is a terminal degree in business administration, and is equivalent to the Ph.D in Business Administration. Successful completion of a D.B.A. is often required to gain employment as a university professor or researcher in the field. As with other earned research doctorates, individuals with the degree use the title \\"Doctor\\" in their name. The post-nominal letters \\"D.B.A.\\" or \\"DBA\\" are often used as well. - Deakin Graduate School of Business provides Deakin University 's major postgraduate business programs covering Master of Business Administration , Master of Commerce , Master of International Business , Master of Marketing , and Doctor of Business Administration courses as well as Executive Development programs . A range of graduate certificate and diploma courses is offered as well . Approximately 3000 students are engaged in higher degrees by coursework or research , and other courses at the business school . In each year since 2008 , the Graduate Management Association of Australia ( GMAA ) awarded Deakin 's generalist MBA course the maximum score of five stars , placing it in the top rank of Australia 's MBA courses . - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Accounting or accountancy is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494. Accounting, which has been called the \\"language of business\\", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators. Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \\"accounting\\" and \\"financial reporting\\" are often used as synonyms. - International business comprises all commercial transactions (private and governmental, sales, investments, logistics, and transportation) that take place between two or more regions, countries and nations beyond their political boundaries. Usually, private companies undertake transactions for profit; governments undertake them for profit and for political reasons. The term \\"international business\\" refers to all those business activities which involve cross-border transactions of goods, services, and resources between two or more nations. Transactions of economic resources include capital, skills, people etc. for the purpose of the international production of physical goods and services such as finance, banking, insurance, construction etc. - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - Post-nominal letters, also called post-nominal initials, post-nominal titles or designatory letters, are letters placed after a person's name to indicate that that individual holds a position, academic degree, accreditation, office, military decoration, or honour, or is a member of a religious institute or fraternity. An individual may use several different sets of post-nominal letters, but in some contexts it may be customary to limit the number of sets to one or just a few. The order in which post-nominals are listed after a name is based on rules of precedence and what is appropriate for a given situation. Post-nominal letters are one of the main types of name suffix. In contrast, pre-nominal letters precede the name rather than following it. - A master's degree (from Latin \\"magister\\") is a second-cycle academic degree awarded by universities or colleges upon completion of a course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently. - A terminal degree is a university degree that is either highest on the academic track or highest on the professional track in a given field of study. The phrase \\"terminal degree\\" is used heavily in the United States, but is used less often outside of that country. The term is not generally used in the United Kingdom or Canada, for example, and its exact meaning varies somewhat between those areas and disciplines in which the term is used. - A doctorate (from Latin \\"docere\\", \\"to teach\\") or doctor's degree (from Latin \\"doctor\\", \\"teacher\\") or doctoral degree (from the ancient formalism \\"licentia docendi\\") is an academic degree awarded by universities that is, in most countries, a research degree that qualifies the holder to teach at the university level in the degree's field, or to work in a specific profession. There are a variety of doctoral degrees, with the most common being the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), which is awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to the scientific disciplines. There are also some doctorates in the US, such as the Juris Doctor (JD), Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and the Doctor of Medicine (MD), which are generally regarded internationally as professional degrees rather than doctorates, as they are not research degrees and no defense of any dissertation or thesis is performed. Many universities also award \\"honorary doctorates\\" to individuals who have been deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or for other contributions to the university or to society. - The Master of International Business (M.I.B. or MIB) is a master's degree designed to develop the capabilities and resources of managers in the global economy. It is ideal for those seeking to establish or accelerate a career in international business. - A Bachelor of Commerce (\\"baccalaureus commercii\\", abbreviated B.Com. or B.Comm.) is an undergraduate degree in commerce (or business) and related subjects, usually awarded in Canada, Australia, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and other Commonwealth countries; however, the degree is no longer offered in the United Kingdom. - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education. - Management (or managing) is the administration of an organization, whether it be a business, a not-for-profit organization, or government body. Management includes the activities of setting the strategy of an organization and coordinating the efforts of its employees or volunteers to accomplish its objectives through the application of available resources, such as financial, natural, technological, and human resources. The term \\"management\\" may also refer to the people who manage an organization. - Deakin University is an Australian public university with approximately 50,644 higher education students in 2014. Established in 1974, the University was named after the leader of the Australian federation movement and the nation's second Prime Minister, Alfred Deakin. It has campuses in Geelong, Warrnambool and Burwood, Melbourne and learning centres in Dandenong, Craigieburn and Werribee, all in the state of Victoria. It was formally established in 1974 with the passage of the \\"Deakin University Act 1974\\". The sale of Stonnington Mansion by Deakin provoked public outrage as it involved the mansion which was at risk of redevelopment by property developers. Deakin is one of Australia's fastest growing research universities. Its combined research funding had increased from A4.5 million in 1997 to A43.4 million in 2014. - Geelong is a port city located on Corio Bay and the Barwon River, in the state of Victoria, Australia, south-west of the state capital, Melbourne. It is the second largest Victorian city, with an estimated urban population of 187,417 as at June 2015, having grown 1.8 percent since June 2014. - Commerce is the activity of buying and selling of goods and services, especially on a large scale. The system includes legal, economic, political, social, cultural and technological systems that are in operation in any country or internationally. Thus, commerce is a system or an environment that affects the business prospects of economies. It can also be defined as a component of business which includes all activities, functions involved in transferring goods from producers to consumers. - Master of Commerce (MCom or M Comm; sometimes \\"Magister Commercii\\") is a postgraduate Masters Degree focusing on commerce-, accounting-, management- and economics-related subjects. Like the undergraduate Bachelor of Commerce, the degree is offered in Commonwealths nations. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Alfred Deakin (3 August 18567 October 1919) was a leader of the movement for Australian federation and later the second Prime Minister of Australia. Deakin was a major contributor to the establishment of liberal reforms in the colony of Victoria, including pro-worker industrial reforms. He also played a major part in establishing irrigation in Australia. - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc. - Business administration is management of a business. It includes all aspects of overseeing and supervising business operations. - A public university is a university that is predominantly funded by public means through a national or subnational government, as opposed to private universities.

Stamps.com on a (Perforated) Tear \\"We've had some great things come through,\\" Stamps.com CEO Ken McBride told me on Friday. One of his favorites was from a woman in Arizona who hadn't changed her hairstyle in 20 years; when she finally did, she commemorated it by taking a photo of her new do and mailing it as a stamp to her friends. (The company has also tried to stop inappropriate stuff. However, in a stunt, thesmokinggun.com got photos of the Unabomber, executed Cold War spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and Monica Lewinsky's stained blue dress onto stamps.) With the startling recent change in Stamps.com's fortunes, the company may want to make a photo stamp out of its stock price chart. Since Stamps.com announced the new photo stamps last month, the stock has shot up 45 percent. When it announced on Sept. 2 that 40,000 sheets, or 800,000 individual stamps, had been sold in three weeks, the stock volume rocketed to four times what it had been two days before, adding 27.3 million in market cap to a company investors value at 380 million. These are pretty heady days for a company that had been near the bottom of the dotcom dog pile for years. But there's a lot to like about what Stamps.com is doing right now, and these photo stamps are just a small part. The company has been flying under the radar on Wall Street since its Icarus-like rise and fall in the late 1990s. Only two analysts cover the stock -- and one of them just started last week. But Stamps.com has quietly and cleverly changed its product lineup to address customer concerns. For instance, businesses now have the ability to hide the amount they pay for postage, so customers won't get the impression they're being gouged for shipping and handling. Stamps.com brought in new management and has inched closer to profitability while initiating large stock buyback programs. \\"They've fixed a lot that was broken,\\" says Russell Hoss, an analyst with Roth Capital Partners, who initiated coverage with a \\"buy\\" rating. \\"The underlying business is on track to be profitable in Q4.\\" Hoss didn't include any photo-stamp sales in his models for the company, but estimates that the product line carries 40 percent gross profit margins for Stamps.com. The other product lines have roughly 60 percent gross margins. Are investors overreacting to the photo stamps? Ah, yeah. At its current levels, the stock has a forward price/earnings ratio just shy of the triple digits, and though both Stamps.com and Hoss project GAAP profitability for next quarter, the recent run-up seems excessive considering it's based on an uncertain product line. I don't doubt the popularity of photo stamps -- I may buy some myself. But let's keep that in perspective. Those 40,000 sheets of stamps the company sold? They grossed Stamps.com all of about 679,600. Also, the current run is part of a two-month experiment set to expire on Sept. 30. A U.S. Postal Service spokesman won't comment on how the trial is running or what happens after Sept. 30. \\"It's a test,\\" he says. \\"We'll evaluate all aspects of the test and make our decision when it's done.\\" When it's done, it's likely that Stamps.com's competitors, most notably Pitney Bowes and Endicia, will consider launching similar services. \\"We're assuming that if this is popular, it will attract people into the market,\\" McBride says. He hastens to add that his company owns nine patents for photo stamps. But if photo stamps truly take off, I believe Stamps.com will face competition from the likes of Kodak and other photo-related firms, possibly making the product line more expensive to sustain, with increased marketing expenses. I applaud the product launch, as well as Stamps.com's other recent moves, but after its latest run-up, the stock is a little too hot for my tastes. Investors should keep their eyes on the USPS decision. They also should pay attention to the company's next earnings report, in late October, to see how the photo stamps have helped the bottom line. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Stamps.com, an online postage service, has seen its stock price surge by 45% following the launch of customizable photo stamps. The company sold 40,000 sheets, or 800,000 individual stamps, within three weeks of launching the product. Stamps.com has made changes to its product lineup, including allowing businesses to hide postage costs, and is predicted to be profitable in the fourth quarter. The future success of the product will depend on the outcome of a two-month experiment set to expire on September 30 and possible competition from rivals such as Pitney Bowes and Endicia, as well as photo-related firms."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere.

It is a hilly island, separated from East Falkland by the Falkland Sound. Its area is , 37% of the total area of the islands. Its coastline is long. - Beagle Channel is a strait in Tierra del Fuego Archipelago on the extreme southern tip of South America partly in Chile and partly in Argentina. The channel separates the larger main island of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego from various smaller islands including the islands of Picton, Lennox and Nueva; Navarino; Hoste; Londonderry; and Stewart. The channel's eastern area forms part of the border between Chile and Argentina and the western area is entirely within Chile. - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty. - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl. - The Falkland Islands are an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf. The principal islands are about east of South America's southern Patagonian coast, at a latitude of about 52°S. The archipelago, with an area of , comprises East Falkland, West Falkland and 776 smaller islands. As a British overseas territory, the Falklands have internal self-governance, and the United Kingdom takes responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs. The islands' capital is Stanley on East Falkland. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - The Anserinae are a subfamily in the waterfowl family Anatidae. It includes the swans and true geese. Under alternative systematical concepts (see e.g., Terres & NAS, 1991), it is split into two subfamilies, the Anserinae contain the geese and the ducks, while the Cygninae contain the swans. - The shelducks, genus Tadorna, are a group of large birds in the Tadorninae subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans. - Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses (Poaceae), however sedge (Cyperaceae) and rush (Juncaceae) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica. Grasslands are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. For example, there are five terrestrial ecoregion classifications (subdivisions) of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome (ecosystem), which is one of eight terrestrial ecozones of the Earth's surface. - The Patagones or Patagonian giants are a mythical race of people, who first began to appear in early European accounts of the then little-known region and coastline of Patagonia. They were supposed to have exceeded at least double normal human height, some accounts giving heights of or more. Tales of these improbable people would take a hold over European concepts of the region for some 250 years, until they were substantially debunked at the end of the 18th century. - The Tadorninae is the shelduck-sheldgoose subfamily of the Anatidae, the biological family that includes the ducks and most duck-like waterfowl such as the geese and swans. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - Tierra del Fuego (; Spanish for \\"Land of Fire\\") is an archipelago off the southernmost tip of the South American mainland, across the Strait of Magellan. The archipelago consists of the main island, Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, with an area of , and a group of many islands, including Cape Horn and Diego Ramírez Islands. Tierra del Fuego is divided between Chile and Argentina, with the latter controlling the eastern half of the main island and the former the western half plus the islands south of Beagle Channel. The southernmost extent of the archipelago is at about latitude 55 S. - Geese are waterfowl belonging to the tribe Anserini of the family Anatidae. This tribe comprises the genera \\"Anser\\" (the grey geese), \\"Branta\\" (the black geese) and \\"Chen\\" (the white geese). Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have \\"goose\\" as part of their names. More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese, and ducks, which are smaller. - Duck is the common name for a large number of species in the waterfowl family Anatidae, which also includes swans and geese. The ducks are divided among several subfamilies in the family Anatidae; they do not represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds, mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both fresh water and sea water. - The Anatidae are the biological family of birds that includes ducks, geese, and swans. The family has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on all the world's continents. These birds are adapted for swimming, floating on the water surface, and in some cases diving in at least shallow water. The family contains around 146 species in 40 genera. (The magpie goose is no longer considered to be part of the Anatidae, but is placed in its own family Anseranatidae.) - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - The coscoroba swan (\\"Coscoroba coscoroba\\") is a species of waterfowl endemic to southern South America. It is the smallest of the birds called \\"swans\\", but still a large species of waterfowl. It belongs to the subfamily Anserinae in the family of ducks, swans, and geese, Anatidae. It is placed in the monotypic genus \\"Coscoroba\\". The coscoroba swan is traditionally considered as an early branch from the common ancestor leading to true geese and swans, and recently genetic studies have associated a phylogenetic relationship between this species and Cape Barren goose (\\"Cereopsis novaehollandiae\\") as sister groups. - Swans are birds of the family Anatidae within the genus Cygnus. The swans' close relatives include the geese and ducks. Swans are grouped with the closely related geese in the subfamily Anserinae where they form the tribe Cygnini. Sometimes, they are considered a distinct subfamily, Cygninae. There are six or seven species of swan in the genus \\"Cygnus\\"; in addition there is another species known as the coscoroba swan, although this species is no longer considered one of the true swans. Swans usually mate for life, though \\"divorce\\" does sometimes occur, particularly following nesting failure, and if a mate dies, the remaining swan will take up with another. The number of eggs in each clutch ranges from three to eight. - Waterfowl are certain wildfowl of the order Anseriformes, especially members of the family Anatidae, which includes ducks, geese, and swans. Some definitions of the term 'waterfowl' include the saltwater shorebirds or waders, gulls, pelicans, and herons, as well as seabirds such as the albatross, but 'fowl' especially refers to birds used by humans for game. They have historically been an important food source, and continue to be hunted as game, or raised as poultry for meat and eggs and are sometimes kept as pets. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. - The kelp goose ( Spanish : Caranca or Cauquén Marino ) , Chloephaga hybrida , is a member of the duck , goose and swan family Anatidae .

Write a title for this article: The increase in demand comes as a new tide of high-rise condominiums is hitting Manhattan. Buyers from other countries who don’t have credit histories in the United States or who do not intend to use their apartments as primary residences have historically had trouble passing muster with co-op boards. But condos pose no problem for foreign buyers, and they often find that buying in Manhattan is less expensive than buying a comparable house or apartment in cities like London. Jonathan Miller, an executive vice president and the director of research at Radar Logic, estimates that foreign buyers have bought about 1,000 newly constructed or converted condos in Manhattan in the last 18 months, which is about a third of the condo sales in Manhattan in that period. And while in the past an influx of foreign buyers could often be traced to boom times in a particular country, brokers say that the interest in Manhattan real estate is now worldwide, with buyers from Australia, Korea, Russia, Israel, Italy and Colombia. “In the late ’80s, we totally depended on the Japanese market,” said Louise Sunshine, development director for the Alexico Group, who has sold apartments to foreign investors for more than two decades. “It’s a diversity of a different kind. There’s a huge amount of new wealth everywhere.” In her work on several Manhattan condo projects, Ms. Sunshine sees this changing market up close. Buyers from five continents inquired about condo suites at the Mark Hotel at 25 East 77th Street, she said, and people from Dubai, Indonesia and Portugal bought apartments at the Laurel at 400 East 67th Street. Manhattan real estate is also benefiting because buyers have lost confidence in other United States markets, especially Florida. “There is the fear factor that prices are going to go down even further,” especially in Miami, said Jacky Teplitzky, an executive vice president at Prudential Douglas Elliman. She said that she had seen a 20 percent jump this year in inquiries from Latin Americans about the Manhattan market and recently, more inquiries from Eastern Europeans, specifically Russians. Some buyers first learned about boom markets in their own countries. Mr. Timmons rose through the ranks, handling the carpentry for 1,000 houses built by Hollioake Homes, a construction company in Ireland. He built another 11 homes on his own to resell. Now that the Irish housing market is slowing down, he has been buying condos under construction in Dubai, London and Warsaw. He read about the Manhattan market in an Irish newspaper and to find his apartment here, he worked with a Dublin broker, Kyle Thomason, who is also licensed to sell real estate in New York. Mr. Timmons said he plans to work for another 10 years, pay off his mortgages and then live off his rental properties. Ms. Thomason said that Mr. Timmons is like many of her clients in Ireland who view these properties purely as investments. They typically don’t ask quality-of-life questions — about schools, for instance. “It’s all based on what their rental yield is going to be,” she said. Not all buyers are investors, of course. After Ana Maria Ruiz, 22, who is from Bogotá, Colombia, got an internship at the Colombian Government Trade Bureau in New York, she needed a place to live. Her parents, who run a general hospital in Bogotá, tried to rent an apartment for her, but decided against it because of the costs involved and because they had no credit history in the United States, which put off prospective landlords. Renting a studio for a year in one building would have been expensive: 33,600 in rent, with half of that amount paid upfront, plus an 8,400 broker’s fee. “My mother said that renting was like throwing your money in the trash,” Ms. Ruiz said. She added that her mother, Clara, already had some experience in foreign investment. She is making almost 1,600 a month renting out a one-bedroom apartment she bought near the Louvre in 2006, Ms. Ruiz said. And since the weakened dollar had made the Colombian peso more valuable, her mother decided to buy an apartment in New York where Ms. Ruiz could live for a year. With help from their broker, Jamie Breitman of Bellmarc Realty, the Ruizes found a 499,000 studio at 145 East 48th Street, with a view of the Chrysler Building. Clara Ruiz arranged for a 100,000 mortgage through Merrill Lynch, where she had a private banking account. Once her daughter moves out of the apartment, Mrs. Ruiz hopes to rent it for 3,000 to 3,500 a month. Brokers say that Korean families who are buying Manhattan apartments typically use them for relatives to live in rather than as rental investments. So they sometimes hold out for features they would expect in their own homes. Youngchul Kim and his wife, Namjoo, first began looking for a Manhattan apartment in 2003 when their middle daughter, Yoojung, 31, began working as an architect here. Mr. Kim invests in Korean real estate, and his wife has a practice treating patients with acupuncture and herbal remedies. But the Kims were a bit perplexed by what passed for luxury in Manhattan. They wanted to buy something new and didn’t understand why people would pay a premium for a prewar apartment. But then their daughter moved to Hong Kong, so they suspended their apartment search. Last year, the Kims’ youngest daughter, Heekyung, moved to Manhattan to work for a venture-capital firm, so the family started apartment-hunting again. “A lot of Korean people automatically associate westernization and modern architecture with luxury,” said Ms. Kim, 26. “For them ‘safer’ is new construction.” The Kims first gathered information about condos at a presentation held in Seoul by Neal Sroka, a broker with the Corcoran Group. Mr. Sroka mentioned the Avery at 100 Riverside Boulevard. They studied the project’s Web site and liked the fact that it showed the views from the apartments. The Kims were also able to talk to friends who had bought real estate in Manhattan, and they were able to take advantage of new South Korean government rules that allow citizens to invest 3 million abroad, instead of 1 million. This summer, the Kims helped Heekyung buy a 1.5 million two-bedroom at the Avery with views that rival their views of the Han River from their apartment in Seoul. Their oldest daughter, Yeonjung, 32, may relocate from Korea to live with her. For some buyers, New York itself is the main attraction, and they like the fact that they can buy apartments in buildings that are recognizable around the world from books and movies. Dr. Nick Kotsomitis, a 39-year-old orthodontist from Brisbane, Australia, owns 16 investment properties in Australia and in Greece. After Dr. Kotsomitis was invited to work in Manhattan for part of the year, he decided to buy. With help from a family friend, Jimena Yudi, a broker at Citi Habitats New York, he chose a 1.885 million studio at the Plaza over larger one- and two-bedroom apartments that cost even more elsewhere. He felt that an apartment at the Plaza would hold its value better than larger apartments in lesser-known buildings. “I have a lot of investment properties, and none of them have books about them,” he said. “They filmed ‘Crocodile Dundee’ here.” In his case, the currency markets set him back. He ended up paying more when he signed the contract in August than he would have paid today because the Australian dollar has strengthened in the interim, but he says he is still happy with the purchase. But foreign buyers quickly learn that there are limits to what they can buy in Manhattan, because it is difficult for them to get into co-ops, which make up about 70 percent of the Manhattan housing held by individual owners. When Nick Ayer moved to Manhattan from London, he was looking for a writing job and a way to invest a £500,000 inheritance (about 1 million). He made a cash offer of 700,000 for a one-bedroom co-op in Chelsea. The sellers accepted the offer, but the co-op board refused to meet with him. He said he believes that although he has United States citizenship — his mother, Dee Wells, was American — he had no credit history in the United States or steady income beyond the inheritance from his father, Sir Alfred J. Ayer, the philosopher and logician. Still, he wanted to take advantage of the weak dollar and buy an apartment. His agent, Andrusha Bohackova of Bellmarc, helped him find a 668,000 one-bedroom condo at 230 Riverside Drive. He moved into the apartment in April and says he’s happy with his investment — for now. He hopes to sell the apartment eventually, move to France or the Amazon and live off the profits. “My money increased 100 percent by just coming over here,” he said.","completion":"Global Buyers Flock to Manhattan: High-Rise Condos Attract Diverse International Investors"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the Mesoamerican region produced several indigenous writing systems beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the Cascajal Block. The Olmec hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán began to wane. Now answer this question: What is presumed to be written upon the Cascajal Block?","completion":"While the specific details of the text inscribed on the Cascajal Block are still under study and interpretation, the Cascajal Block is generally presumed to feature an example of one of the earliest-known systems of writing in the Americas. Often associated with the ancient Olmec civilization, the text on this artifact is believed to be hieroglyphic in nature, given the presence of symbolic, picture-like forms. Following the tradition of the Olmec civilization, it is likely that the Cascajal Block contains ritualistic or religious content, as the Olmec were known to associate writing with their rituals and deities. However, due to the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the Olmec language and the deteriorating state of the artifact, the exact content of the text remains largely speculative. Each side of the Block is covered with a total of 62 signs, some of which are repeated. 28 unique signs have been identified, hinting at the language's complexity and the possibility that it may have had phonetic as well as symbolic components. One proposed interpretation suggests the text possibly describes the Olmec cosmos and their religious beliefs. According to another theory, it might be an early form of a calendar or record-keeping device. These interpretations, while plausible, are based on small samples and limited understanding of the Olmec hieroglyphs and thus should be seen as tentative at best. In conclusion, while the exact content of the text on the Cascajal Block remains uncertain due to the mystery surrounding the Olmec language, it is generally agreed that the block contains an extensive inscription that marks it as one of the earliest-known examples of writing in the Americas. Given the Olmec's propensity for religious and ritualistic content in their writing, it is plausible to suggest that these themes might also feature in the script found on the Cascajal Block."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question: Jeffrey increases the number of carbon atoms to a natural gas hydrocarbon in a lab. The isomers increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"When Jeffrey increases the number of carbon atoms in a natural gas hydrocarbon in a lab, the number of isomers will increase. Step 1: Understand the relationship between the number of carbon atoms and isomers in hydrocarbons. The equation that governs this relationship is: more carbon atoms = more possible isomers. Step 2: Apply the relationship to the given scenario. In this case, Jeffrey is increasing the number of carbon atoms in a natural gas hydrocarbon. Step 3: Determine the effect on the number of isomers. Given the relationship between carbon atoms and isomers, the number of isomers will also increase as the number of carbon atoms increases.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the last names of the French critics who promoted the painter who had only a few copies of his works produced? ? El Greco was disdained by the immediate generations after his death because his work was opposed in many respects to the principles of the early baroque style which came to the fore near the beginning of the 17th century and soon supplanted the last surviving traits of the 16th-century Mannerism. El Greco was deemed incomprehensible and had no important followers. Only his son and a few unknown painters produced weak copies of his works. Late 17th- and early 18th-century Spanish commentators praised his skill but criticized his antinaturalistic style and his complex iconography. Some of these commentators, such as Antonio Palomino and Juan Agustín Ceán Bermúdez, described his mature work as \\"contemptible\\", \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"worthy of scorn\\". The views of Palomino and Bermúdez were frequently repeated in Spanish historiography, adorned with terms such as \\"strange\\", \\"queer\\", \\"original\\", \\"eccentric\\" and \\"odd\\". The phrase \\"sunk in eccentricity\\", often encountered in such texts, in time developed into \\"madness\\".With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century, El Greco's works were examined anew. To French writer Théophile Gautier, El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme. Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero (the \\"gifted\\", the \\"misunderstood\\", the \\"mad\\"), and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco's later technique. French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting. In the 1890s, Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor. However, in the popular English-speaking imagination he remained the man who \\"painted horrors in the Escorial\\" in the words of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia in 1899.In 1908, Spanish art historian Manuel Bartolomé Cossío published the first comprehensive catalogue of El Greco's works; in this book El Greco was presented as the founder of the Spanish School.

Consider for a moment what it must be like to be Uwe Boll. Somewhere, perhaps in those places that Jack Nicholson said 'you don't talk about at parties', Boll knows that David Lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him. Gore Whores, metal-heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the Teutonic helmsman's output so bereft of originality, wit or imagination that he's become the internet's bogeyman  an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement. Boll does his best to ride over these naysayers, exploiting tax credits available in Germany and Canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as Zero Mostel did with old ladies in The Producers. The difference being that Mostel's character knew he was making bowel fill. Maybe Uwe knows it too. Such is the level of hostility toward each new 'Bollbuster' that IMDb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they've seen it. Boll's attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined. Indeed he's probably the only filmmaker that's boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage. This onslaught has made Uwe a very thick skinned man, so much so that he must feel like he's wrapped in a carpet, but one who feels as if he's bullied by the entire world. Like most people in that situation he lashes out, determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding Variety's review of House of the Dead, never too far from the surface. This 'I know you are but what am I' strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of Postal, which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 9/11, Christian fundamentalism, Jihad, Nazism and paedophilia. Such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of Peter Cook and the visual imagination of Chris Morris but the closest Boll gets to either man is the o in their surname. In Seed, shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation, Boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer (is there any other kind?) who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life. Mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free, though if you'd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to, they pronounce him legally dead and bury him, only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers. Boll begins his 'exploration of nihilistic rage' with Seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes. From there we're treated to the killer's stock in trade  kidnapping dogs, babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food. We're invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are  our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition. Yes, we're worthless, gormless sadists and worse than that, we won't give Uwe a good rating on the IMDb. In short, humanity is bunk. Of course you might think that Uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it's a bit of a bipolar piece, on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness  the milk that poor old Boll has had to drink for so long, while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth. The result says nothing about society and its discontents, more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director. Poor Uwe is obviously a very angry man  one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair, no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy's about dispatching various web critics. That it's there but takes an avant-garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread, shows that Boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements. He's made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate. \\"I wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun\\" Boll told the audience at the film's world premiere and he has, on that flimsy manifesto, succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director's detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker, he'll need something genuine to say as well as a better, more original way of saying it. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer has consistently criticized Uwe Boll, the filmmaker in question, throughout the review. The review critiques the filmmaker's skills, his tactics in handling critics, and his work's lack of originality, imagination, and plot coherence. It also negatively comments on the use of graphic violence and the filmmaker's apparent anger towards his critics. The reviewer concludes with the opinion that, if the filmmaker wants to be taken seriously, he needs to have something meaningful to say and find an original way to say it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a bold declaration of its ambition, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has laid claim to leadership of the global Islamist movement, calling on Muslims worldwide to swear allegiance to its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. By claiming such preeminence, ISIS is seeking to eclipse al Qaeda and its leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in what analysts see as the most dramatic shift in militant jihadism since 9/11.

Betty is more old fashioned..","completion":"Betty is more old fashioned. Katrina and Betty were sisters, born only a year apart. They shared quite a few common interests, but their tastes differed significantly when it came to the finer things in life. One of the most apparent differences was their views on wine labels. Katrina, the younger of the two, had always been drawn to the bright, vibrant designs that decorated some of the newer wines on the market. She believed that a colorful label represented the fun and adventure she sought in her life. Whenever the sisters went shopping for wine, Katrina would carefully scan the aisles, her eyes immediately gravitating towards the most striking labels that depicted beautiful artwork, catchy graphics, and other creative elements. Step 1: Establish the differing viewpoints of Katrina and Betty Step 2: Show examples of the different wine labels they prefer On the other hand, Betty, the older sister, appreciated a more traditional approach with her wine selection. She believed that a wine's quality and history should speak for itself rather than relying on flashy visual appeal. She tended to choose her wine based on the reputation of the vineyard and the taste of the wine rather than the style of the label. For her, a minimalist and classic label represented elegance and sophistication, which in turn reflected her more old-fashioned sensibilities. Step 3: Explain Betty's preference for traditional wine labels Step 4: Connect Betty's wine label preferences to her old-fashioned nature Although their preferences for wine labels differed, Katrina and Betty loved spending time together sipping on a fine wine. They often had discussions about the various wines they tried, comparing their personal tastes and preferences. Over time, the sisters began to appreciate the reasons behind each other's choices. Katrina started to find merit in the history and legacy of traditional wines, whereas Betty admitted that some modern wines, with their artistic labels, were enchanting in their own right.

They discovered new wines they might never have tried otherwise and found common ground in their shared appreciation for the stories and experiences behind each bottle. In the end, whether they chose a colorful or a traditional label, the sisters were always happy to raise their glasses together in celebration of their unique tastes and their close-knit relationship.

For those smart Asian kiddos, it's like walking through the park: easy and carefree. _ As I arrived outside of the dining hall, already a mob of students were sitting, talking, or standing silently waiting to get in. Jones students are lucky not only to have such a testing center at school, but also the feeling of their home school where it feels comfortable and familiar. \\"ID, please,\\" my former math teacher asked at the door. \\"Okay.\\" She looked over my ID, checked off my name on her list, and pointed towards the dining hall tables inside.

At least fourteen people could sit at this table but only four were allowed to take their test here. \\"I'm glad it's multiple choices.\\" I heard one student say.

Here is a premise: \\"A woman and a little girl are making something at a pottery wheel.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The girl is the womans daughter\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise given - \\"A woman and a little girl are making something at a pottery wheel\\" - describes a scene where the two individuals are engaged in a pottery-related activity. The hypothesis proposed is that \\"The girl is the woman's daughter.\\" The premise offers limited information about the connection between the woman and the little girl. It only elucidates their participation in a pottery-related activity, but it does not provide any explicit evidence or confirmation about the girl being the woman's daughter. Therefore, we cannot determine the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the information given in the premise. There could be various possibilities as to their relationship, even if not explicitly mentioned. For instance, the woman could be the girl's mother, as the hypothesis suggests, or she could be a teacher, a relative, a babysitter, or even a family friend. This ambiguity leaves the hypothesis unconfirmed. In order to determine whether the hypothesis aligns with the premise, we would require more information on the context and relationship between the woman and the little girl. Additional context, such as conversations between the two or more background information about their history together, would be needed to either confirm or debunk the hypothesis. In conclusion, the premise does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the truth of the hypothesis that the girl is the woman's daughter.

Q:Information: - Andreas Capellanus ( Capellanus meaning \`\` chaplain '' ) , also known as Andrew the Chaplain , and occasionally by a French translation of his name , André le Chapelain , was the 12th - century author of a treatise commonly known as De amore ( \`\` About Love '' ) , and often known in English , somewhat misleadingly , as The Art of Courtly Love , though its realistic , somewhat cynical tone suggests that it is in some measure an antidote to courtly love . Little is known of Andreas Capellanus 's life , but he is presumed to have been a courtier of Marie de Champagne , and probably of French origin . - Chivalry, or the chivalric code, is a code of conduct associated with the medieval institution of knighthood which developed between 1170 and 1220. The ideals of chivalry were popularized in medieval literature, especially the Matter of Britain and Matter of France, the former based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\" which introduced the legend of King Arthur, written in the 1130s. - Courtly love (or fin'amor in Occitan) was a medieval European literary conception of love that emphasized nobility and chivalry. Medieval literature is filled with examples of knights setting out on adventures and performing various services for ladies because of their \\"courtly love\\". This kind of love is originally a literary fiction created for the entertainment of the nobility, but as time passed, these ideas about love changed and attracted a larger audience. In the high Middle Ages, a \\"game of love\\" developed around these ideas as a set of social practices. \\"Loving nobly\\" was considered to be an enriching and improving practice.

They both made great progress. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person observed that the climate becomes colder at high elevations? Hint: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate. Answer:","completion":"Jerry"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: This article: The search for a singer-actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873. Press speculation favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie, a rising star of the Opéra-Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes. He would later become a baritone, and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles. Jacques Bouhy, engaged to sing Escamillo, was a young Belgian-born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as Méphistophélès in Gounod's Faust and as Mozart's Figaro. Marguerite Chapuy, who sang Micaëla, was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her \\"one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know\\". However, she married and left the stage altogether in 1876, refusing Mapleson's considerable cash inducements to return. contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that James H.

As described in the process you mentioned, a functioning lamp is crucial for the flashlight to work properly, as it allows the light to be emitted when the circuit is complete. Now, let's analyze how the absence of a broken lamp affects each of the mentioned steps in the process: 1. Batteries are put in a flashlight: The lamp's condition has no effect on this step. 2. The flashlight is turned on: The lamp's functionality is essential in this step, so having an operational lamp results in a more effective flashlight. 3. Two contact strips touch one another: The lamp's condition has no effect on this step. 4. A circuit is completed between the batteries and the lamp: A functioning lamp will allow the circuit to be completed more effectively, resulting in better flashlight performance. 5.

Movie title: Black Orpheus Movie plot: A marble Greek bas relief explodes to reveal black men dancing the samba to drums in a favela. Eurydice (Marpessa Dawn) arrives in Rio de Janeiro, and takes a trolley driven by Orfeu (Breno Mello). New to the city, she rides to the end of the line, where Orfeu introduces her to the station guard, Hermes (Alexandro Constantino), who gives her directions to the home of her cousin Serafina (LÃ©a Garcia). Although engaged to Mira (Lourdes de Oliveira), Orfeu is not very enthusiastic about the upcoming marriage. The couple go to get a marriage license. When the clerk at the courthouse hears Orfeu's name, he jokingly asks if Mira is Eurydice, annoying her. Afterward, Mira insists on getting an engagement ring. Though Orfeu has just been paid, he would rather use his money to get his guitar out of the pawn shop for the carnival. Mira finally offers to loan Orfeu the money to buy her ring. When Orfeu goes home, he is pleased to find Eurydice staying next door with Serafina. Eurydice has run away to Rio to hide from a strange man who she believes wants to kill her. The man â Death dressed in a stylized skeleton costume â finds her, but Orfeu gallantly chases him away. Orfeu and Eurydice fall in love, yet are constantly on the run from both Mira and Death.

(CNN) -- For once it wasn't Rafael Benitez facing the hard questions. The Chelsea manager has faced a barrage of criticism from fans and media this season, but this week he has led the English club to vital victories in the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League. By contrast, much of the focus ahead of Sunday's home match against Sunderland was on the struggling team's controversial appointment of manager Paolo Di Canio. Is he a fascist or not? Will he talk about it?

Its contemporary usage originated with Akio Nakamori's 1983 essay in Manga Burikko. Otaku may be used as a pejorative; its negativity stems from the stereotypical view of otaku and the media's reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, \\"The Otaku Murderer\\", in 1989. According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as otaku, both in Japan and elsewhere. Otaku is derived from a Japanese term for another person's house or family (oZhai , otaku). This word is often used metaphorically, as an honorific second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal translation is \\"you\\". For example, early in the anime Macross, first aired in 1982, the characters Hikaru Ichijyo and Lynn Minmay use the term this way to address one another, until they get to know each other better. The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in hiragana (otaku), katakana (otaku or, less frequently, wotaku) or rarely in romaji, first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist Akio Nakamori. His 1983 series An Investigation of \\"Otaku\\" ({otaku} noYan Jiu , \\"Otaku\\" no Kenkyu), printed in the lolicon magazine Manga Burikko, applied the term to unpleasant fans in caricature. Animators Haruhiko Mikimoto and Shoji Kawamori had used the term between themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s. Supposedly, some fans used it past the point in their relationships where others would have moved on to a less formal style. Because this misuse indicated social awkwardness, Nakamori chose the word itself to label the fans. Morikawa Kaichiro, an author and lecturer at Meiji University, identified this as the origin of its contemporary usage. Another claim for the origin of the term comes from the works of science fiction author Motoko Arai, who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves. However, a different claim points to a 1981 Variety magazine essay. In 1989, the case of Tsutomu Miyazaki, \\"The Otaku Murderer\\", brought the fandom, very negatively, to national attention. Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and slasher films that were found interspersed with videos and pictures of his victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine Bessatsu Takarajima dedicated its 104th issue to the topic of otaku. It was called Otaku no Hon (otakunoBen , lit. The Book of Otaku) and delved into the subculture of otaku with 19 articles by otaku insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there negative connotations for the word?","completion":"Yes, there are negative connotations for the word \\"otaku.\\" Its negativity stems from the stereotypical view of otaku as socially awkward and obsessive individuals, as well as the media's reporting on Tsutomu Miyazaki, known as \\"The Otaku Murderer,\\" in 1989. This association with an infamous criminal case further intensified the negative perception of otaku. However, it is important to note that according to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as otaku, both in Japan and elsewhere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Jon had spent eight seasons breaking this ground to plant spring's crops and every year it got harder. Sweat beaded on his brow and he felt his cotton shirt stick to his skin under his coat. Jon took off his soft-brimmed hat and wiped his forehead. He examined the hat as he let his breath return. The hat had kept the burning sun and beating rain off his head for as long as Jon owned the farm. He wore it every day. It had been a gift given to him on the day he married Alasandra but he could not remember who gave it to him. Jon put it back on his head and pushed the tiller deep into the stubborn earth. Daven ran over the hill and down the cart path leading to their small cobblestone house.

The boy continued to run and soon the wind carried his cry to his father's ears. \\"Papa! A carriage is coming! Two horses!\\" Jon's furrowed brow remained.

They recently met and discussed their health problems over coffee. Tom had hypertension and the doc told him to change his diet. Which friend didn't have to start eating spinach? The answer is:","completion":"Jerry is the friend who didn't have to start eating spinach. Tom and Jerry, both 50 years old, reconnected after having attended high school together and had a conversation regarding their current health issues. Tom mentioned that he was diagnosed with hypertension, a medical condition characterized by high blood pressure levels. Due to this, his doctor advised him to make changes to his diet in order to manage and potentially alleviate his hypertension symptoms. Spinach is a leafy green vegetable known for its many health benefits, especially for those with hypertension. This is due to its high content of nitrates, which can help lower blood pressure by improving the function of the endothelium, the blood vessel lining. Spinach is also a good source of potassium and magnesium, which are essential minerals that help in regulating blood pressure. Since Tom was advised to change his diet to manage his hypertension, it can be inferred that incorporating healthy foods such as spinach would be beneficial for him. On the other hand, Jerry, who didn't mention any health issues related to hypertension in their discussion, is not required to start eating spinach for those same reasons. However, it should be noted that incorporating spinach and other nutrient-dense foods into one's diet is generally a good idea for overall health and well-being, regardless of whether one has hypertension or not. In summary, while Jerry didn't have to start eating spinach in relation to the specific health discussion with Tom, it could still be a valuable addition to his diet for other health reasons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: when amina faints, what appears on her wrist? Title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. and the situation: An anthropologist gathered observations for two native tribes from southern Africa. He noticed that both tribes spend the majority of the day outside, and therefore they are both exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light. He also quickly realized that one key difference between the tribes was that members of tribe A had dark skin, while members of tribe B had light skin. Answer the following question: Members of which tribe will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency? Answer:","completion":"Members of Tribe A, with dark skin, will be at a greater risk for vitamin D deficiency. This is because melanin, which is present in higher amounts in darker skin, blocks UV light from penetrating the skin. As a result, people with darker skin may not synthesize enough vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, putting them at a higher risk for vitamin D deficiency compared to those with lighter skin, like the members of Tribe B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask a question about Iran.","completion":"What are the major historical, cultural, and political factors that have shaped modern-day Iran, and how do they influence its international relationships and domestic affairs? Iran, a country with a rich historical and cultural heritage, has gone through significant transformations over several millennia. To get a comprehensive understanding of modern-day Iran, it's crucial to explore the major historical, cultural, and political factors that have shaped the nation, including the Persian Empire, Islamic conquest, Safavid Dynasty, Qajar Dynasty, Pahlavi Dynasty, the Islamic Revolution, and foreign influences. 1. Persian Empire: The roots of modern-day Iran can be traced back to the Achaemenid Empire, established by Cyrus the Great in the 6th century BCE. This empire established the foundations of Iran's unique cultural identity, centralized administration, and developed communication and transportation infrastructure. The Persian Empire greatly valued tolerance and remained multicultural and multiethnic, influencing Iran's diverse cultural makeup today. 2. Islamic Conquest: In the 7th century CE, Iran was conquered by the Arab-Muslim armies, leading to the spread of Islam and the assimilation of Iranian culture into the broader Islamic civilization. The adoption of Islam left a profound impact on Iran's religious, political, and educational life, which continues to resonate in the country's contemporary identity and political culture. 3. Safavid Dynasty: In the early 16th century, the Safavid Dynasty, established by Shah Ismail I, marked a significant turning point in Iran's history. This era witnessed the development of the Shi'a Islamic theocracy, which united the country and solidified Iran's national identity. The distinct cultural and religious identity has remained central to Iran's political and social landscape, contributing to tensions with its predominantly Sunni Muslim neighbors. 4. Qajar Dynasty: The Qajar Dynasty ruled Iran between the late 18th and early 20th centuries. During this period, Iran faced increasing pressure from European powers, particularly Russia and Great Britain, leading to the loss of significant territories and resources. This era of colonization left a lasting impact on Iran's international relations, fostering a strong sense of nationalism and suspicion of foreign intervention. 5. Pahlavi Dynasty: Established in 1925 by Reza Shah, the Pahlavi Dynasty sought to modernize Iran by implementing political, economic, and social reforms. This westernization process, however, led to increased income inequality and disregard for traditional values, contributing to widespread dissatisfaction amongst the population. 6. Islamic Revolution: The Islamic Revolution of 1979, led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, caused the overthrow of the Pahlavi monarchy and the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The revolution dramatically shifted Iran's political landscape, prioritizing Islamic values and anti-western sentiment, and instituting a theocratic government structure. 7. Foreign Influences: The role of foreign powers, such as the US and European countries, has been significant in shaping Iran's political and social circumstances. The US-backed coup in 1953 to remove Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh, the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s with Western support for Iraq, and ongoing economic sanctions have reinforced Iran's skepticism of foreign powers and its determination to maintain sovereignty and self-reliance. These historical, cultural, and political factors continue to impact Iran's international relationships and domestic affairs. Iran's complex relationships with Western nations, its contentious nuclear program, involvement in regional conflicts, and civil liberties issues within the country are all influenced by this intricate history. Understanding these factors is essential in interpreting Iran's geopolitical strategies and addressing contemporary challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Members of the government can take advantage of the natural resources (e.g., diamonds and oil in a few prominent cases) or state-owned productive industries. A number of corrupt governments have enriched themselves via foreign aid, which is often spent on showy buildings and armaments.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Some indicators that might suggest someone has stolen money in some way, especially in the context of government and corruption, are: 1. Unexplained or sudden increase in personal wealth or assets: If a government official or employee suddenly acquires expensive properties, vehicles, or other luxury items without a clear legitimate source of income, it may indicate embezzlement or corruption. 2. Missing or misused public funds: Large amounts of money may be missing from government accounts or not being used for their intended purpose, such as funds for public infrastructure, social services, or foreign aid. 3. Lack of transparency in government transactions: The absence of open and transparent bidding processes or insufficient documentation for high-value government contracts can be a sign of corruption or money being stolen. 4. Nepotism and favoritism: Government jobs, contracts, or other benefits might be awarded to friends and family members without a merit-based process, suggesting that money is being misappropriated. 5. Price inflation in government contracts: When contract prices for goods or services significantly exceed market rates, it may indicate that government officials are taking kickbacks or profiting from the contracts. 6. Extravagant public projects or spending: Government officials investing in lavish buildings, excessive military spending, or other showy projects not aligned with public needs could be a sign of money being stolen. 7. Reports of bribes or payoffs: Accusations or evidence of government officials soliciting or accepting bribes in exchange for favors, contracts, or protection from legal consequences can suggest money being stolen. 8.

PUBLISHED:. 18:25 EST, 5 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 08:01 EST, 6 December 2012. George Osborne targeted workers at the top, middle and bottom of the financial heap yesterday with a raft of money-saving measures. He ordered a tax raid on higher earners’ pensions, warning that Britain is only a third of the way through its age of austerity. He dragged 400,000 more workers into the 40p tax rate by raising the earnings threshold by just one per cent – below the rate of inflation. Scroll down for video. Smiles: Mr Osborne, grinning yesterday, targeted workers at the top, middle and bottom of the financial heap with a raft of money-saving measures. Autumn Statement: Mr Osborne admitted higher government borrowing and lower-than-expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year, to 2018. And the canny Chancellor dared Labour to oppose real-terms cuts in welfare payments to millions of unemployed and lower-income families for the next three years, declaring himself on the side of those ‘who want to work hard and get on’. In his Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne admitted higher government borrowing and lower-than-expected economic growth meant spending cuts and tax rises designed to balance the books would have to be extended by an extra year, to 2018. Official figures showed that the hardest hit by his measures will be the top ten per cent and bottom ten per cent of earners. But today Mr Osborne defended the move to increase the number of people earning just over £41,000 who will end up paying the 40p tax rate. 'I would not describe those people as wealthy. They’re better off than many of their citizens but they’re certainly not wealthy,' he told BBC News. 'What I’ve tried to do, in a very difficult situation where I’m trying to control government spending, is make sure it is done fairly across all incomes.' David Cameron, on a visit to east London this morning, also defended the need for more cuts: We've had to take very difficult decisions and I don't hide that for a minute. 'What this Autumn Statement and what this government is all about is being on the side of people who work hard and want to get on.' David Cameron, who today addressed the Electric City Conference in east London, insisted the government is 'on the side of people who work hard and want to get on' Mr Cameron today met Daniel Hirshmann, co-founder and director of electronics company Technology Will Save Us to highlight government support for entrepreneurs. The Prime Minister added: 'By lifting the personal allowance, the amount of money you can earn before you pay any income tax, it is very close now to our goal of £10,000. 'It is hugely helpful to all working people. It means for instance someone on the minimum wage but who works full-time, working hard, we have halved their income tax under this government. 'Clearly by cancelling the 3p increase in fuel duty we're helping again people who have to use their cars to get to work. So we're on the side of those who work hard.' In a boost for Middle Britain, the Chancellor announced a surprise increase in the personal income tax allowance, meaning the first £9,440 earned will be tax free. Mr Osborne won his loudest cheers as he told MPs he was scrapping a 3p increase in fuel duty pencilled in for January. But official figures show that as a result of all the tax, benefit and public spending changes implemented by the Coalition since 2010, the average household will be around £1,140 worse off by 2015, with the top fifth of households £2,370 worse off. In other key moves, corporation tax was cut by an extra penny to 21p by 2014, compared with 28p when the Coalition came to power, and small businesses were given investment tax breaks. From 2014, lifetime pension relief allowance will fall from £1.5million to £1.25million and annual allowance will be cut from £50,000 to £40,000. The point at which debt is predicted to begin falling was delayed by a year to 2016. Estimates for public-sector job losses were increased to 1.1million, though twice as many jobs will be created in the private sector. Heads will be given discretion over teachers’ pay in a move which infuriated trade unions. Basic state pension will rise by 2.5 per cent next year to £110.15 a week. The Chancellor said that as a result of his plans, government spending as share of national income would fall from 48 per cent in 2009/10 under Labour to 39.5 per cent in 2017/18. But he was forced to concede that there is ‘much more to do’ to restore the public finances to health against a backdrop of gloomy economic data. Mr Osborne conceded the budget deficit was ‘still far too high for comfort’, though he wrongfooted Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls by announcing that having already been cut by 25 per cent, the deficit will unexpectedly fall again this year – thanks in part to a £3.5billion windfall from the sale of the 4G mobile phone spectrum. He used a fresh round of spending cuts from day-to-day Whitehall budgets to pay for investment in projects designed to stimulate the economy. There will be a £5billion investment programme in new roads, 100 new free schools and academies, science laboratories, ultra-fast broadband and further education colleges. ‘We cannot relax our efforts to make our economy safe,’ the Chancellor told MPs. ‘But Britain is heading in the right direction. The road is hard but we’re making progress. It’s taking time, but the British economy is healing. ‘As well as a tax system where the. richest pay their fair share, we have to have a welfare system that is. fair to the working people who pay for it.’ Mr. Osborne announced that he is to change the law to break a link between. inflation and the ballooning welfare bill, with out-of-work benefits. rising by just one per cent for the next three years. Under previous. rules, benefits were increased every April by the inflation rate in the. previous September, which this year was 2.2 per cent. Mr Osborne said. that as a result, the incomes of those on out-of-work benefits has. soared by 20 per cent since 2007, twice the rate of a worker on average. earnings. Labour insisted. that 60 per cent of those affected by the real-terms welfare cuts,. however, were in work – because working tax credits, child tax credits,. local housing allowance, maternity allowance and statutory maternity pay. will also be affected. Statement: George Osborne said the move would return 'fairness' to the benefits system. All smiles: The Chancellor, seen with Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and David Cameron, is forcing the Opposition into a corner over whether to oppose the cap. The Chancellor said a new round of tax rises and spending cuts was necessary because the eurozone crisis had hit the economy and the recession was worse than previously thought – with almost seven per cent of national income lost in 2008 and 2009. Quoting the latest forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, he said the economy was now expected to shrink by 0.1 per cent this year compared with a previous prediction of 0.8 per cent growth. He admitted he was on course to miss his target that debt should start falling as a proportion of GDP by 2015/16 – the year of the next election. Instead he said it would take another year. Mr Balls, pictured, said the Autumn Statement illustrated the ¿true scale of this Government¿s economic failure¿. Announcing the cut in corporation tax to 21 per cent, compared with 40 in the US, 33 in France and 29 in Germany, the Chancellor said: ‘This is the lowest rate of any major western economy. Britain is open for business.’ Mr Balls said the Autumn Statement illustrated the ‘true scale of this Government’s economic failure’. He added: ‘The Chancellor’s fiscal strategy has been completely derailed. The defined purpose of the Government, the cornerstone of the Coalition, the one test they set themselves – to balance the books and get the debt falling by 2015 – is now in tatters.’ Labour would not say whether it intended to vote against legislation limiting benefit increases and a move to cap overall benefit payments, saying it would study the detail.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The South Western Ambulance Service pilot began in February. It gives staff three minutes, rather than the current government target of one minute, to assess calls that are not immediately life threatening. The trial was launched in response to the \\"unprecedented increase in demand for ambulance services\\". It was announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in January and covers Cornwall, Isles of Scilly, Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Somerset and South Gloucestershire. He said the aim was to establish if allowing a longer assessment could help ambulance services maintain or even improve the clinical outcomes for patients. In situations where a patient is not breathing or unconscious, an ambulance is still dispatched within the 60 seconds. Neil Le Chevalier, South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust's director of operations, said since the pilot began it had doubled its \\"hear and treat\\" rate because it had the time to assess and advise over the phone. \\"It's been very successful and there have been no safety issues,\\" he told BBC News. He said the main benefit was being able to determine the most appropriate response. \\"When somebody dials 999, they're in a panic, so it can take up to 45 seconds just trying to find out where the patient is and we're frequently sending an ambulance out under blue lights on an address incident only, not knowing what we're dealing with,\\" he said. \\"This new pilot gives us two extra minutes to ascertain exactly what's wrong.\\" In the first 26 weeks, he said more than 400,000 emergency calls had gone through the system with \\"70,000 ambulances not dispatched\\". Mr Le Chevalier said call handlers ask a series of questions using a triage system of assessment approved by the Royal College of Surgeons and they also have a directory of services available to them. \\"Instead of dispatching an ambulance, we can send a mental health team, a falls team or indeed refer to a GP if that's more appropriate,\\" he added.","completion":"So, there is a special group of people who help take care of others when they are hurt or sick and need a ride to the hospital. They use really fast cars with lights and loud noises called ambulances. Sometimes, lots of people need help at the same time, and it can be hard for them to figure out who needs help the most. They used to have only one minute to decide, but now they get three minutes, except if someone is really, really sick, they still send help as fast as they can. They have been trying this new way for a little while, and it helps them make better choices about what kind of help to send. Sometimes people need a doctor, or a special team, instead of an ambulance.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In organic chemistry, an alkene is an unsaturated hydrocarbon that contains at least one carbon--carbon double bond. The words alkene and olefin are often used interchangeably (see nomenclature section below). Acyclic alkenes, with only one double bond and no other functional groups, known as mono-enes, form a homologous series of hydrocarbons with the general formula CH. Alkenes have two hydrogen atoms fewer than the corresponding alkane (with the same number of carbon atoms). The simplest alkene, ethylene (CH), with the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name ethene, is the organic compound produced on the largest scale industrially. Aromatic compounds are often drawn as cyclic alkenes, but their structure and properties are different and they are not considered to be alkenes. What's the best answer to this question: can alkenes have more than one double bond?","completion":"Yes, alkenes can have more than one double bond. When an alkene has two or more double bonds, it is called a polyene or a diene, triene, etc., depending on the number of double bonds.

Article: Britain's oldest man made his first visit to London yesterday at the age of 101. Mr. John Evans had never found the time or money to make the trip from his home in Forest Fach, near Swansea. But, when British Rail offered him an all-expenses-paid birthday trip to the capital he just could not refuse. He arrived at Paddington Station and smartly turned out in his best suit, favorite Panama hat and a red rose in his buttonhole. \\"It's very exciting. There's no doubt about it,\\" he said. Until yesterday he had never been far from home, except for one trip to Aberdeen. \\"But I've been on the seas to that faraway land called Ilfracombe 21 miles from home,\\" he joked. Mr Evans, who spent 60 years working as a miner in South Wales, almost made the journey to London once before, at the turn of the century. \\"There was a trip to the White City but it was ten shillings return from Swansea -- too much I thought. All my money went to the family then,\\" he said. During the next two days Mr. Evans will be taken on a short tour of London to see the sights. Top of his list is a visit to the House of Parliament organized by his MP, Mr. Gareth Wardell. The only arrangement he does not care for is the wheelchair provided for him if he gets tired. \\"I don't like the chair -- people will think I am getting old. \\" he said. His secret for a long and healthy life has been well publicized -- no wine, no tobacco and no anger.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Determine What You Can Afford Understanding your financial capacity is crucial, as it helps you plan for various milestones in life like buying a home, pursuing higher education, or preparing for retirement. Here are some steps to guide you in determining what you can afford: a. Calculate your monthly income: Assess your total income by adding up your salary, bonuses, and other forms of earnings.

Be as comprehensive as possible, including rent, utilities, groceries, loan payments, insurance premiums, and entertainment expenses. c. Analyze your debts: Take a comprehensive look at your outstanding debts, such as student loans, credit card balances, or personal loans. Determine your debt-to-income ratio (the percentage of your income that goes towards paying off debts). d. Set financial goals: Establish both short-term and long-term financial goals. Short-term objectives may include building an emergency fund or saving for a vacation. Long-term goals could involve planning for retirement or purchasing a house. e.

The brand new furniture didn't fit in the room because we forgot to measure, and the Available choices: -- furniture was too small.; -- room was too small.;","completion":"-- room was too small. It was a sunny morning as Emma and Jack stood in their new house, eagerly examining each room, envisioning the future they'd build together in their very first home. The couple decided to refurbish the house by buying some new furniture; however, they had failed to predetermine the sizes and dimensions they'd require for each room. As the delivery truck arrived containing various pieces of their newly purchased furniture, the excited couple couldn't help but notice a sense of impending doom. The boxes seemed quite large, and they were growing increasingly concerned about their compatibility with the limited space available in the rooms. Starting with the living room, it was immediately apparent that their gorgeous L-shaped sofa, complete with a chaise lounge attachment, was much too large for the room. The high-pile, intricately woven rug that was meant to sit beneath the coffee table was barely visible due to the sprawling mass of the sofa. Proceeding to the dining area, their excitement was once again dampened. They had chosen a stunning, long, 8-seater solid oak dining table, perfect for hosting grand dinner parties. However, the room's dimensions were much too small, as the table left no space for chairs to successfully slide under. The matching buffet table was forced to be propped against the far wall, partially obstructing the window, resulting in a further loss of natural light. In the bedroom, the issues persisted. Their luxurious, king-size sleigh bed, along with two elegant nightstands on either side, created a cramped and uncomfortable experience. It was impossible to open the room's door fully, as it would hit the edge of one of the nightstands. Even the heavy, floor-length curtains were unable to drape properly because the window was too close to the bed. The couple realized that their enthusiasm had prevented them from accounting for the room sizes in their new home. Feeling embarrassed and disappointed, they agreed upon the necessity of returning or exchanging some of the bigger pieces and downsizing their furniture selection. This predicament, however, proved to be an opportunity for the couple to come together, addressing the situation constructively. They began by taking precise measurements of each room and created a list of appropriately sized furniture that would still reflect their tastes and styles while matching the actual dimensions of the house. Soon enough, they were able to find more suitable alternatives. The L-shaped sofa was replaced with a comfortable, yet compact, loveseat. The massive dining table made way for a stylish and modular 4-seater version. The bedroom saw the king-size sleigh bed swapped out for a cozy, appropriately sized queen bed that provided enough space for the nightstands and other necessary furnishings. During this process, the couple gained a better understanding of their new home and the importance of scaling their purchases to match the space available. More importantly, they learned how to work together as a team, considering each other's preferences and incorporating their individual styles into their shared space. They found the silver lining in their initial disappointment and, ultimately, built a harmonious and beautiful home that they could both enjoy. In the end, although the room was initially too small for their extravagant furniture choices, the lessons they learned and the compromises they made together led to the creation of a warm, welcoming, and well-designed living space where they could grow and thrive in their new life together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox.

White team warmed up before the race, but Blue team arrived with a bus late and didn't have time to warm up properly before the race. Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Emily Davies. The widow of a fusilier shot dead on a training exercise has told of her disgust after it emerged the soldiers who killed her husband will be released from prison today and be allowed to rejoin the army. Newlywed James Wilkinson, 21, was killed by machine gun fire during a mock battle in training with the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in Kenya in 2011. Last summer Corporal Colin Bell, 30, and Staff Sergeant Patrick Price, 43, were given sentences of 14 months and 21 months respectively at a court martial for negligently performing a duty. Distraught: Sarah Wilkinson has blasted the appeals granted for the servicemen that shot her husband James in mock battle in Kenya in 2011. They had been married for four months when Private Wilkinson was killed. Sarah was pregnant with their daughter Annabelle, now aged two. James helped her bring up her first son Connor (all pictured together) Private Wilkinson’s widow, Sarah, spoke of her horror that the two men were yesterday granted appeals against their sentences. Their orders barring them from the army were quashed and the judge reduced them both to the rank of private. Mrs. Wilkinson, 23, said: ‘I’m absolutely shocked and disgusted that the men. responsible for taking my husband’s life are being let back into the. army like they have done no wrong. ‘Their. original sentence was not harsh and if they had any respect for James. or any compassion for my children and I they would have just kept their. heads down and got on with it.’ The couple had been married for four. months when Private Wilkinson was killed and Mrs Wilkinson was pregnant. with their daughter Annabelle, now aged two, at the time. He had helped raise her son Connor, now aged four, from a previous relationship, whom he treated as a son of his own. Private Wilkinson was killed by a machine gun, which went off in the hands of Colin Bell, 30. Widow Sarah claims Bell and Patrick Price, who was supervising, wouldn't rejoin if they had compassion for her. ‘They didn’t just take one life that day, they took several,’ she said. ‘I will always love James with all my heart and I will never forgive anyone involved for letting him die in vain. 'I hope people question who some of the heroes of our country are. I know I would die before I let my son serve with these irresponsible men.’ Private Wilkinson died when a malfunctioning machine gun accidentally fired. Price supervised the exercise and Bell was holding the weapon when it went off. Mrs Wilkinson criticised the decision to release Bell and Price from prison and to allow them to rejoin the army. She said: 'I will never get over losing my husband. I will never accept that there is no justice' ‘I will never get over losing my husband. I will never accept that there is no justice. I just wish they could accept the consequences of their actions. ‘I want to be honest with my children as they grow up. 'Before at least I could tell them that the men who killed their dad were punished for what they did, but now they have the anguish of knowing the men can continue to represent our country with pride.’ Appeal judge, Lord Justice Pitchford, said reducing their ranks was sufficient but dismissed Price’s appeal against his conviction. ‘While we accept that the consequence of the appellants’ negligence was both extremely serious and tragic, we do not concur in the view that these offences could be regarded as at or near the most serious of their kind,’ he said. ‘In our judgment, theirs was not a reckless disregard for safety but a failure under pressure of circumstances to recognise a danger which, in other circumstances, would have been clear to them.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"This article is about a situation where a soldier named James Wilkinson was accidentally killed during a training exercise.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: gwen was captured by a wildvine? Movie title: Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix Movie plot: During a battle with Dr. Animo, Ben Kirby Tennyson's destruction of the scientist's \\"DNA bomb\\" accidentally sets off a self-destruct protocol in the Omnitrix. Its activation alerts Tetrax (known as Hoverboard in \\"Hunted\\"), who travels with his alien blob-like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he's hiding out on: Xenon. Vilgax, who has also picked up on the Omnitrix's self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix (an alien who also appeared in 'Hunted' and tracks Ben). While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax, who has escaped the Null Void and has commandeered a ship to track down Ben. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though Gluto is killed in the conflict while protecting Gwen. Gwen blames Ben's selfishness despite the fact that Ben had nothing to do with it. Tetrax's ship crashes on Azmuth's homeworld. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna (Wildvine's species) which capture Gwen. Ben is depressed, and blames... Answer:","completion":"Yes, I can help answer your questions regarding the film proposal for \\"Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix.\\" In the movie plot you provided, Gwen was indeed captured by a Florauna, which is the species of the \\"Wildvine\\" alien from the Ben 10 series. These creatures are known for their plant-like features, vine growth abilities, and agility. This moment where Gwen is captured adds a sense of tension and urgency to the story, as Ben must now not only worry about the self-destructing Omnitrix but also the safety of his cousin. As for the movie title, \\"Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix\\" is an appropriate choice since the storyline revolves around the protagonist, Ben Tennyson, discovering more about the origin and creator of the Omnitrix device, which is a key element in the series. It also implies that there are hidden aspects of the Omnitrix that both Ben and the audience have yet to uncover, adding a sense of curiosity and intrigue to the film. When it comes to the movie's plot, the film focuses on the urgency of Ben's quest to stop the self-destruct countdown of his powerful Omnitrix device. This is accomplished by introducing new and returning characters that provide information and assistance throughout his journey. The stakes are high since the Omnitrix self-destructing would result not only in Ben's death, but also the obliteration of a significant portion of the universe, including Earth. Some points to consider while deciding on investing in this film proposal include the popularity and longevity of the Ben 10 franchise, which has a dedicated fan base. Additionally, the proposal presents an engaging storyline with high stakes and character development. The inclusion of familiar faces from the series and the introduction of new characters, such as Myaxx and Gluto, may attract more fans and promote the film's success. In the end, deciding to invest in this film proposal depends on factors such as the potential target audience, budget, and the reputation of the creators and production team. Weighing the benefits of investing in this proposal, such as the popularity of the franchise and an exciting storyline with high stakes, against potential downsides like the financial commitment and risks of the investment, will help determine if it is a worthwhile and profitable endeavor."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As fate would have it, Charlotte meets Diego at a local marketplace, and, in an instant, the pair falls deeply in love. Diego is captivated by Charlotte's enchanting beauty and fierce spirit, while Charlotte is drawn to Diego's kindness and bravery. Unfortunately, their whirlwind romance is short-lived, as Esteban quickly learns of their secret affair. Furious at Diego's defiance and determined to eliminate his sworn enemy once and for all, the cunning Esteban devises a diabolical plot. He kidnaps Charlotte and threatens to execute her if Diego does not surrender to him. Consequently, the Sanciscos and the townspeople are left in utter dismay, fearing the loss of their beloved leader and their chance to overthrow the oppressive Montenegro regime.

Q: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Part #2: The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. Usage: \\"jump opposite left and run\\" instructs the agent to perform \\"I_JUMP\\" in the opposite left direction, followed by \\"I_RUN\\". The 'and' indicates that the next part of the command will be executed after the jump action is completed. Part #3: The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction, and the word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. Usage: \\"run opposite left\\" means the agent will perform \\"I_RUN\\" while turning backward in the left direction. This aligns with the criteria because the agent is performing the run action along with turning in the specified (left) direction, but in the opposite way. Part #4: The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Usage: \\"run opposite left thrice\\" means the agent will execute the \\"I_RUN\\" action in the opposite left direction three times.

A bank draft is a type of payment instrument issued by a bank, guaranteeing the payment of a specific amount to the recipient. To obtain a bank draft, a person needs to visit their bank, request a draft for the desired amount, and provide the bank with the necessary funds. The bank will then issue the draft, which can be securely handed over to the recipient in lieu of cash or other forms of payment. The second question, \\"Why do I see the size of Injustice: God among us as 2.11gb on my device whereas 1.24gb on other devices?\\", pertains to the storage space occupied by the game \\"Injustice: Gods Among Us\\" on different devices. This question is unrelated to banking or financial instruments, and instead concerns file size discrepancies between devices, which can be caused by various factors. For example, different devices may have distinct variations of the game optimized for their hardware or operating system, leading to differences in file size.

They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish. - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m. Its length is up to 15 cm. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. What is the relationship between 'scaly gurnard' and 'species'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'scaly gurnard' and 'species' is that the scaly gurnard (Lepidotrigla brachyoptera) is a specific species of sea robin belonging to the family Triglidae.

The teenager was spotted by an anti-crime patrol unit driving in an unmarked police car in a neighborhood in Brooklyn, according to official reports. The incident began when members of the NYPD who were patrolling the area noticed a group of men congregating on a street corner, with the 16-year-old among them. The officers paid particular attention to the teenager, who appeared to be fidgeting with his waistband as he walked away from the group. Given the city's increased focus on reducing gun violence, the officers decided to approach the young man for questioning. As the officers left their unmarked vehicle and moved closer to the teenager, police reports state that the situation escalated quickly when the 16-year-old turned on the approaching officers and allegedly aimed a .357 caliber revolver at them. The sudden show of aggression left the officers with little choice but to open fire on the teen in self-defense, resulting in his death. The identity of the deceased teenager has yet to be released, pending notification of his family, and an investigation into the incident is currently ongoing. NYPD has not disclosed the specific number of shots that were fired but confirmed that the teenager was declared dead at the scene. It is not yet clear whether the .357 caliber revolver found in the possession of the teenager was legally registered or if he had any previous criminal record. This disturbing incident comes at a time when gun violence in New York City has seen a marked uptick in recent months, prompting a significant increase in police presence and patrols in certain neighborhoods. With Mayor Bill de Blasio focusing on reducing crime rates as a part of his public safety agenda, incidents like this one highlight the challenge the city faces in addressing the growing concerns around gun violence and community safety. The actions of the NYPD officers involved will undoubtedly come under scrutiny, as officer-involved fatalities continue to be a point of contention and debate nationwide. Police departments across the United States have grappled with calls for reform, increased accountability, and more transparent practices as communities demand more responsiveness from their law enforcement agencies. As the investigation into this incident continues, the NYPD and the city's leadership will face tough questions on how best to balance the need to ensure public safety while also rebuilding trust between the police and the communities they serve. While the shooting may have been the result of an immediate threat to the officers' lives, critics may argue whether there could have been alternative solutions or approaches that wouldn't have ended in the loss of a young life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Seconds Movie plot: Seconds is an expressionistic blend of horror, thriller and science fiction about the obsession with eternal youth and misplaced faith in the ability of medical science to achieve it. Arthur Hamilton (John Randolph) is a middle-aged man whose life has lost purpose. He has achieved success in his career, but finds it unfulfilling. His love for his wife of many years has dwindled.

The movie does not provide a clear answer to the identity of the person whose body was given to Hamilton. The \\"Company\\" probably acquires bodies through a secretive and ethically questionable process, likely involving individuals who are desperate or in vulnerable situations. The film serves as a commentary on the lengths people are willing to go for a shot at eternal youth and a perceived fresh start, as well as the potential consequences of trying to escape one's past instead of facing it head-on. Overall, the film is a thought-provoking exploration of the human pursuit of everlasting youth and raises ethical questions about the potential of medical science to give people an opportunity to start anew in a different, younger body."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the first name of the person in whose place Hugh Robertson was appointed complex manager at Rockefeller Center? Answer the above question based on the context below: The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza. Merle Crowell set up a viewing platform on the east side of Rockefeller Center and founded the facetious \\"Sidewalk Superintendents' Club\\" so the public could view construction.

The full name of this person is John Todd."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help.

New England is a region in the northeastern part of the United States, comprising six states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Each of these states has its own unique characteristics and offerings, but Maine is the largest of them in terms of land area. Maine, also known as the Pine Tree State, covers an area of approximately 35,385 square miles (91,646 square kilometers), making it the 12th largest state overall in the United States. It has a population of around 1.3 million people according to the latest estimates, making it one of the least densely populated states in the country. The state of Maine is known for its picturesque landscape, which includes dense forests, spectacular coastline, and numerous lakes, rivers, and mountain ranges. Acadia National Park is a must-see destination for nature lovers, and Mount Katahdin, the highest peak in the state, attracts hikers and outdoor enthusiasts from around the world. In addition to its natural beauty, Maine is also renowned for its charming towns and fishing villages along its extensive coastline and the numerous lobster shacks, where one can taste some of the best seafood in the region. The state's economy is mainly driven by agriculture, fishing, forestry, and tourism, but it also has a growing high-tech sector.

Jessica was much less friendly. (b). Tanya was much less friendly.","completion":"Tanya was much less friendly. Jessica took the lead in social situations with Tanya since Tanya was much less friendly. Tanya's introverted nature made it difficult for her to feel comfortable or charismatic during interactions with new people. As a result, Jessica often assumed the role of the catalyst, making introductions and initiating conversations on behalf of the duo. Jessica had thought about the origins of Tanya’s introverted nature and believed it might trace back to her childhood. Growing up in a strict household, Tanya's parents always emphasized the importance of obedience and compliance. As a result, Tanya developed an innate fear of displeasing others that had followed her into adulthood. This fear manifested in her social interactions, often leading her to avoid initiating conversations or sharing her opinions openly, lest she unintentionally offend someone. On the other hand, Jessica grew up in a relatively carefree environment. Her upbringing was filled with love, laughter, and encouragement to pursue her dreams. As a result, Jessica developed a strong sense of self-confidence which shined through when engaging with others. To help Tanya feel comfortable in social scenarios, Jessica adopted a few key strategies. Initially, she ensured that they always arrived at events together, establishing their united presence upon arrival. This tactic allowed Tanya to feel safe and secure, knowing that she had someone to rely on throughout the gathering. Additionally, Jessica made it a point to inquire about Tanya's interests and opinions prior to attending gatherings, providing her with talking points to focus on during conversations. Armed with this knowledge, she began nudging Tanya into fray, gently encouraging her to speak up when the conversation shifted to familiar territory. While this was challenging at first, over time, Tanya became more adept at recognizing opportunities to contribute and found her voice in these settings. Furthermore, Jessica intentionally engaged Tanya in conversations with thoughtful questions and commentary, subtly bridging gaps between Tanya and other party-goers. This approach not only provided Tanya with validation and reassurance but also allowed others to view her as a valuable and engaging conversationalist. With time and patience, Tanya's social skills slowly began to evolve. She started discovering her own unique conversational style, and though she still leaned heavily on Jessica’s support, she began to grow more comfortable articulating her thoughts and ideas. Jessica's unwavering kindness and understanding played a crucial role in reshaping Tanya's perspective on social settings, leading her on a journey towards becoming a more generous and open-hearted individual. As their friendship blossomed, it became evident that Jessica's extroverted nature complemented Tanya's introverted disposition. Their bond strengthened as they taught each other valuable lessons about communication, empathy, and the beauty of embracing the differences that existed within themselves and others. Ultimately, Jessica and Tanya discovered that their contrasting personalities were instrumental in forming the foundation of a rich, lasting friendship that transcended the nuances of social expectations and norms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Judge Carlos Samour Jr. will send out 5,000 jury summons and expects at least 3,200 people will end up in court, he ruled on Thursday. That would mean each of the 450,000 Arapahoe County residents eligible for jury duty would have a 1 in 90 chance of being called, for this one case alone, court spokesman Rob McCallum told CNN. The idea is to bring in 800 prospective jurors at a time on Thursdays and Fridays early next year, a process that","completion":"is expected to take several weeks to complete. Once all prospective jurors have been given the opportunity to report to the court, the selection process will begin to whittle down the large pool to a final jury of 12, with a few alternates. This process will involve extensive questioning in both individual and group settings, as well as careful background checks to ensure that each juror is unbiased and able to fulfill their duties. Due to the high-profile nature of the case and the severity of the alleged crimes, finding impartial jurors may prove to be a challenging task. The attorneys from both the prosecution and defense will play a critical role in this phase, raising objections and striking potential jurors based on their beliefs, opinions, and personal experiences. The judge, in turn, will have the final say in approving or excusing these individuals from serving on the jury. Once the jury has been selected, the trial will commence, with both the prosecution and defense presenting their cases. The prosecution will aim to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Holmes is guilty of the charges against him, while the defense will work diligently to create doubt in the jurors' minds and fight for an acquittal or lesser charge. The trial is expected to be lengthy, given the complexity of the case, the numerous witnesses, and the vast amount of evidence to be reviewed. As the trial progresses, emotions will undoubtedly run high, with both the family members of the victims and the survivors themselves likely to provide heart-wrenching testimony. The intense media coverage and public interest will place an additional layer of scrutiny upon every aspect of the trial. In light of this, Judge Samour will have to maintain a firm grip on proceedings to ensure that decorum and order are maintained. Following the closing arguments from both prosecution and defense, the jury will be sequestered, tasked with the monumental job of deciding the fate of James Holmes. They will be required to weigh all the evidence, testimonies, and arguments presented before them and reach a unanimous decision. This process could take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, given the gravity of the charges and the intricacy of the case. Ultimately, the resolution of the Colorado theater shooting trial hinges on the determination and diligence of these citizens, as they fulfill their civic duty in search of the truth and justice. Regardless of the outcome, the trial will undoubtedly serve as a somber reminder of the tragic events that occurred in Aurora, and the need for continued efforts to prevent such acts of senseless violence in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For climates that occasionally go without rain for several days to several weeks, additional watering is almost certainly needed. Check the condition of the soil on a regular basis. Once the surface feels dry, you should give the soil a thorough drenching. Never let the roots stay too dry for too long, even after the plant is established. Rather than giving small watering every day, give a heavy watering every few days. Feed the plant with a slow-release fertilizer at the start of spring, and give them an additional dose six to eight weeks later. You can either use an all-purpose fertilizer that contains equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, or you can opt for a fertilizer that contains higher levels of nitrogen and phosphorus. Phosphorus helps with root and flower development, while nitrogen aids in the establishment of full, vibrant foliage. Note that you should only apply fertilizer when the soil is wet. Water the soil upon application so that the fertilizer washes down below the surface. Fertilizer should also be applied during the early morning or evening, when the temperatures have cooled. Following both of these measures will prevent the fertilizer from burning your plant. Use bark chips or any other type of mulch that retains moisture well. Scattering a solid layer of mulch around the plant base helps the soil stay moist and also acts as a type of weed control. Additionally, decomposing mulch can add more nutrients to the surrounding soil. The plants spread quickly, and as they spread, large clumps of root form. The crowns of these clumps tend to rise above the soil. You should cover the crowns with loamy soil to keep the roots from drying out. The most common insects and diseases to attack the Astilbe plant include the tarnished plant bug, powdery mildew, and bacterial leaf spots. Even so, the plant is not especially prone to pests. If any of these problems do emerge, you can apply an appropriate insecticide or fungicide then. Preventative pesticides are not recommended, however. Every spring, you should take divisions of the Astilbe plant's roots to prevent the roots from choking each other out. You can replant these divisions to create new plants, give them to gardening friends, or discard them. You can use your divided plants to form a solid bed of color, or line a shaded garden pathway with your beautiful flowers. Summary:","completion":"This article discusses caring for Astilbe plants in various climates, stressing the importance of regular soil check, thorough watering, using slow-release fertilizer, mulching, protecting roots and crowns, managing pests and diseases, and dividing roots annually to maintain healthy growth and vibrant foliage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: A 42-year-old man, understood to be Robert Daniel, was treated for an arm injury after being shot outside his home in Stepps on Sunday evening. Detectives are treating the \\"targeted\\" attack as attempted murder. They believe a white Audi estate driven by the suspects fled along the M80 towards Glasgow. They are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have dashcam footage. The victim was reversing his car out of his drive in Honeywell Drive, Cardowan, just after 21:00 on Sunday when a white Audi estate car pulled up and several shots were fired. A car matching the description was later found burnt out in the Haghill area. Officers are still trying to establish how many occupants were in the Audi and said inquiries had revealed it sped off down Honeywell Drive and into Dewar Road. It then drove onto the M80 heading towards Glasgow before finally ending up in Hogarth Park, Haghill. Det Supt Kenny Graham said: \\"We are following up a number of lines of enquiry. However, we know several people were walking in Dewar Road and in the surrounding areas around the time of the incident. I would urge these people to contact us as I'm sure they have information which could assist our ongoing investigation. \\"In terms of the M80, I am appealing to motorists who were on that road on Sunday night, in particular, anyone with any dashcam footage is asked to pass it on to police. \\"It could offer us vital footage on the occupants of the car which could lead us to tracing whoever is responsible for this crime.\\" Detectives have previously said the shooting may be linked to organised crime. Officers were continuing to carry out door-to-door inquiries and CCTV footage was still being examined. Summary:","completion":"A man got hurt in his arm because someone shot at him outside his house. The police think it was on purpose and are trying to find the people who did it.

Choices: - behind - loose - feverishly - slowly - lightly The rationale to choose \\"lightly\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"Lightly Step 1: Analyze the question and choices First, we need to understand the question and available choices. The question asks how John's feet touched the ground when he ran very fast. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant choices We can eliminate some choices right away if they do not relate to the manner in which John's feet touched the ground while running fast. We can remove \\"behind\\" as it is not relevant to how John's feet touch the ground. \\"Loose\\" and \\"feverishly\\" can also be eliminated, as they do not describe the contact between feet and the ground. Step 3: Compare the remaining choices Now, we are left with two choices: \\"slowly\\" and \\"lightly.\\" Let's analyze both options in the context of the question. Step 4: Analyze the \\"slowly\\" option When someone runs very fast, their feet generally do not touch the ground \\"slowly.\\" In fact, it would be contradictory, as running fast implies quick movements and less time in contact with the ground. Step 5: Analyze the \\"lightly\\" option Running fast requires minimal ground contact time and proper running form. A faster runner typically lands more lightly on their feet since they spend less time contacting the ground and more time propelling themselves forward. This option makes sense in the context of the question. Step 6: Choose the most appropriate answer Based on the previous steps, we can conclude that \\"lightly\\" is the most suitable answer, as it describes how John's feet touched the ground when he ran very fast. The rationale for choosing \\"lightly\\" is that it corresponds to the reduced ground contact time and better running form typically associated with faster running."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Elections to the Senate are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years, Election Day, and coincide with elections for the House of Representatives.

The Elections Clause of the United States Constitution grants each state (and Congress, if it so desires to implement a uniform law) the power to legislate a method by which senators are elected. Ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates also vary from state to state. Can we conclude that does the whole state vote for both senators?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that the whole state votes for both senators, but it is essential to recognize that senators' elections are staggered and not held simultaneously. In the United States, the Senate is composed of two senators from each state, and every senator serves a six-year term. However, these terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the Senate seats are up for election every two years. These staggered elections are intended to preserve the Senate's stability and maintain a balance of power across the nation. In every even-numbered year, Senate elections are held alongside elections for the House of Representatives. Each state, as a whole, votes for their senators in a statewide election. The election system for senators varies according to each state's preferences and regulations. It can involve a primary election followed by the general election or other procedures, such as a caucus or convention, to determine the final candidates for the general election. The Elections Clause of the United States Constitution grants the power to each state (and Congress, if it chooses to implement a uniform law) to legislate a method by which senators are elected. Furthermore, ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates may differ from state to state. These regulations impact candidate qualifications, filing deadlines, and the requirements for appearing on the ballot. In summary, the whole state votes for both senators in a statewide election for each senator's six-year term. However, these elections are staggered, ensuring that only one senatorial position is up for grabs in each state during every standard election cycle. The method of conducting these elections and regulations regarding ballot access and candidate qualifications are subject to each state's legislative decisions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some guy named John Cohen. I guess this was the first screenplay he's ever worked on. Someone should've told him you're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say. And who directed this? Scott Marshal? Son of Gerry Marshall. My the nut has fallen far from the tree. Someone might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a cab in New York, and it will look real, and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. Might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from Jessica Simpson, but hopefully he's learned that lesson now. And Jessica Simpson... naturally she can't act. Hell, she makes Jessica Alba look like Audry Hepburn, and yet she's starring in this movie. OH wait, it was produced by her father. Okay, that's why she got the part. That's really the only reason I can think of. So should I be surprised it's bad? No. Should I be amazed at how bad it is? I think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as I did. I mean you expect a movie starring Jessica Simpson to be bad, but this... it's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic film. Think of a great Woody Allen movie, this film is as bad as that film is good. It's the Anti-Annie Hall. I am so glad I didn't pay to see it, I stopped watching ten minutes in cus I couldn't go on. No doubt I would've walked out of the theater sooner. In fact I wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. The film starts out laughably bad, and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of Chinese water torture. And then, around when the first act is ending, you realize it'll only get worse, and that's when you either need to leave, or kill yourself.

He goes to a rural church to photograph some graves. Meanwhile, three farmers are attempting to remove an ominous stone column from a field. Two of the farmers head home. A thunderstorm appears out of nowhere, and smoke pours from the ground. Lightning strikes the column. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt. Howard meets Declan O'Brien (Ronan Wilmot), who directs him to Reverend Coot. The curious O'Brien approaches the altar and places his hand on it. Images flash before his eyes.

Please answer the following question: Background: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying.

Lee, Courtney Kube, Kristen Welker and Stephanie Ruhle WASHINGTON — White House chief of staff John Kelly has eroded morale in the West Wing in recent months with comments to aides that include insulting the president's intelligence and casting himself as the savior of the country, according to eight current and former White House officials. The officials said Kelly portrays himself to Trump administration aides as the lone bulwark against catastrophe, curbing the erratic urges of a president who has a questionable grasp on policy issues and the functions of government. He has referred to Trump as \\"an idiot\\" multiple times to underscore his point, according to four officials who say they've witnessed the comments. Kelly called the allegations \\"total BS.\\" \\"I spend more time with the president than anyone else and we have an incredibly candid and strong relationship,\\" said Kelly in a statement. \\"He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS. I am committed to the president, his agenda, and our country. This is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration’s many successes.\\" Three White House spokespeople said they don't believe it's accurate that Kelly called the president an \\"idiot,\\" adding that none of them has ever heard him do that or otherwise use that word. Officials said Kelly's public image as a retired four-star general instilling discipline on a chaotic White House and an impulsive president belies what they describe as the undisciplined and indiscreet approach he's employed as chief of staff. The private manner aides describe may shed new light on why Kelly now finds himself — just nine months into the job — grappling with diminished influence and a drumbeat of questions about how long he'll remain at the White House. \\"He says stuff you can't believe,\\" said one senior White House official. \\"He'll say it and you think, 'That is not what you should be saying.'\\" President Donald Trump talks with then Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly during commencement exercises at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on May 17, 2017. Susan Walsh / AP file Trump, who aides said has soured on his second chief of staff, is aware of some though not all of Kelly's comments, according to the current and former officials. The White House spokespeople said they haven't heard Kelly talk about himself as the one saving the country, and that if anything he may have spoken in jest along those lines. Presidential historian Michael Beschloss said Kelly's comments about Trump, when compared to previous White House chiefs of staff, \\"suggest a lack of respect for the sitting president of a kind that we haven't seen before.\\" Beschloss said the closest similarity would be President Ronald Reagan's chief of staff during his second term, Don Regan, who \\"somewhat looked down on\\" his boss and eventually lost the support of the staff and the president. Regan was replaced after two years by Howard Baker. The last time it became public that one of Trump's top advisers insulted his intelligence behind his back, it didn't go over well with the president. White House aides have said Trump never got over former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson calling him a \\"moron\\" in front of colleagues, which was first reported by NBC News. Trump later challenged Tillerson to an IQ test and fired him several months after the remark became public. Current and former White House officials said Kelly has at times made remarks that have rattled female staffers. Kelly has told aides multiple times that women are more emotional than men, including at least once in front of the president, four current and former officials said. And during a firestorm in February over accusations of domestic abuse against then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter, Kelly wondered aloud how much more Porter would have to endure before his honor could be restored, according to three officials who were present for the comments. He also questioned why Porter's ex-wives wouldn't just move on based on the information he said he had about his marriages, the officials said. Some current and former White House officials said they expect Kelly to leave by July, his one-year mark. But others say it's anyone's guess. What's clear is both Trump and Kelly seem to have tired of each other. \\"Kelly appears to be less engaged, which may be to the president's detriment,\\" a second senior White House official said. Kelly has maintained at least two close allies in the West Wing — Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, and White House counsel Don McGahn, current and former officials said.

Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post via Getty Images file The White House spokespeople conceded that Trump gets frustrated at times with Kelly, particularly when he feels Kelly is not giving him all the information he needs and wants. They said Kelly and Trump have an open, candid relationship. The spokespeople disputed that staff has lost confidence in Kelly, saying he's still chief of staff so when he issues an order aides comply and that \\"for the most part the staff still respects and genuinely likes Kelly.\\" The White House spokespeople said they haven't seen Kelly have a negative effect on the morale of women staffers. If anything, they said during meetings Kelly is the \\"bigger gentleman\\" who steps in when aides use foul language to note \\"a lady is present\\" and similarly says he shouldn't use foul language in front of a lady if he's used an expletive. The spokespeople, who would not speak for the record, said it's possible Kelly may have said women are more emotional than men, with one of them agreeing that \\"generally speaking, women are more emotional than men.\\" \\"We've got to save him from himself\\" Kelly entered the White House with a mandate to instill order in a West Wing where aides regularly had unfettered access to the president. He adopted some key changes, such as shrinking the number of people in meetings and limiting access to the Oval Office. He has also pushed back against the president on some foreign policy and military issues, current and former White House officials said. In one heated exchange between the two men before February's Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kelly strongly — and successfully — dissuaded Trump from ordering the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula, according to two officials. For Kelly, the exchange underscored the reasoning behind one of his common refrains, which multiple officials described as some version of \\"I'm the one saving the country.\\" \\"The strong implication being 'if I weren't here we would've entered WWIII or the president would have been impeached,'\\" one former senior White House official said. Kelly has made similar comments to lawmakers, at times making fun of what he sees as Trump's lack of knowledge about policy and government, current and former officials said. He's been particularly cutting when it comes to immigration issues, which he considers one of his policy strong suits, having served as Homeland Security secretary and head of the combatant command for U.S. military operations in Central America and South America, the officials said. Kelly held a series of meetings in his office with White House officials during negotiations with lawmakers on funding for the president's border wall and a resolution on a program — known as DACA — that allows some people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children to remain in the country, according to four officials who either attended or were briefed on the meetings. He often used the settings to express concern that Trump would agree to a deal that's not hardline enough on immigration and criticized the president's knowledge of the issues to underscore his point, the officials said. \\"He doesn't even understand what DACA is. He's an idiot,\\" Kelly said in one meeting, according to two officials who were present. \\"We've got to save him from himself.\\" After the talks on a bipartisan deal fell apart, a collapse Kelly helped orchestrate with some conservative Republicans, he told aides in his office: \\"If it weren't for me the president was going to agree to some hasty deal,\\" according to two officials who were present at the time. \\"He doesn't even understand what DACA is. He's an idiot.\\" Three White House press spokespeople said Kelly did express concern in meetings that Trump would agree to a deal that was too soft on immigration, and after bipartisan talks collapsed told staff that if it weren't for him the president would have cut a bad deal. The spokespeople also said Kelly may have said something along the lines of, \\"The president doesn't know the full impact of DACA.\\" But they said they don't believe he called him an \\"idiot.\\" The spokespeople disputed that Kelly is less engaged in his job. They said he still sees the president and is in the Oval Office more than anyone else. They said Kelly put a much-needed system in place in the West Wing and has over time felt the need to hover less over the president. They said Kelly is still the first person in the White House at 6 a.m. \\"The president talks to a lot of people but no one talks to him more than the chief of staff,\\" one of them said. The spokespeople said they have not heard Trump talk seriously about withdrawing all troops from the Korean Peninsula. One person who has known and worked with Kelly over the years said he uses \\"coarse language\\" when he is in what he believes to be trusted company. The public has seen some glimpses of the Kelly that White House officials describe privately. In October, he made comments about a Florida congresswoman that were not accurate. He also remarked that when he was growing up \\"women were sacred,\\" suggesting he holds some antiquated views of women's roles. And Kelly angered the president in January when he suggested on Fox News that Trump wasn't fully informed on immigration issues. Trump \\"felt misled\\" Multiple White House staff pointed to the controversy over the allegations against Porter as an instance where the frustrations aides have had with Kelly intersected to make a bad problem worse. They said aides were particularly taken aback by his attempt to inaccurately portray his role in Porter's ouster. While Kelly initially defended Porter publicly, he was even more emphatic in private, four current and former officials said. Kelly, who had access to Porter's FBI file, suggested to aides that he had information that told a different story than news reports and urged Porter for some 18 hours not to resign, the officials said. Once Porter resigned, Kelly stunned aides when he urged senior White House officials in a staff meeting to advance the false narrative that he had ousted Porter less than an hour after learning the details of the allegations, the officials said. One official said that aides who have details that others may not say Kelly is correct that he moved within less than an hour to fire Porter. Kelly has similarly been less than forthcoming at times with the president, officials said. The two men clashed early on over who would replace Kelly as Homeland Security secretary, three current and former officials said. Trump had wanted to consider Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach and tasked Kelly with bringing him a short list of candidates, the officials said. After some informal interviews with potential nominees, Kelly gave Trump two choices, according to the officials: Kobach and Kelly's deputy Kirstjen Nielsen. Trump later became convinced Kelly had manipulated the process so he'd pick Nielsen, given the doubts that Kobach could get confirmed, the officials said. \\"He felt misled,\\" said a senior White House official who was there at the time. Trump was suspicious that Kelly would similarly try to ensure someone he favored would replace former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, three current and former officials said. Trump had for months complained that McMaster's briefing style was irritating and would do impressions of the three-star general bellowing out a list of points in staccato, his body puffing up and down as he spoke, the officials said. Sometimes Trump would see McMaster on his schedule and ask aides to have him write up a memo instead, the officials said, so he didn't have to meet with him. The president ultimately settled on a successor for McMaster whom officials said was not a Kelly pick, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. Most recently, Trump fumed over reports on a passage in former FBI Director James Comey's book about Kelly calling Comey, after the president unceremoniously fired him, to say he didn't want to work for \\"dishonorable\\" people, according to five officials. When reports of the phone call first surfaced last summer, Kelly denied disparaging the president, three officials said. The White House spokespeople said the list of candidates the Office of Presidential Personnel had to succeed Kelly was longer than Kobach and Nielsen, but that doesn't mean it didn't come down to those two once it went to the president. They said after Trump chose Nielsen he saw criticism of her from conservatives and confronted Kelly about it. They did not dispute that Trump imitated McMaster and pushed him off his schedule at times in favor of a memo. They confirmed that Bolton was not Kelly's preferred choice. The spokespeople said Kelly denies saying anything negative about the president to Comey and that it was merely a call to wish him luck. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

(Associated Press) Director of Oval Office Operations Jordan Karem, left, and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly stand in the door of the Oval Office before a news conference with President Donald Trump and Nigerian... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — New details emerged on the rift between White House chief of staff John Kelly and President Donald Trump, with one former administration official saying Kelly privately called Trump \\"an idiot\\" last year. Kelly's insult to the president's intelligence, confirmed to The Associated Press by the former official, came as his clashes with Trump over policy and personnel grew louder and more frequent. Kelly, who has cast himself as safeguarding the public from the president, has also threatened to quit the White House on several occasions. Kelly's disparaging remark was first reported Monday by NBC News. In a statement Monday, Kelly called the report \\"total BS,\\" and characterized his relationship with Trump as \\"incredibly candid and strong.\\" He added of the president, \\"He always knows where I stand and he and I both know this story is total BS.\\" Kelly's top aide, Zachary Fuentes, also disputed the characterization, saying he had never heard Kelly describe the president that way. \\"Remember, he is a Marine. Once a Marine, always a Marine,\\" said Fuentes. \\"The office of the commander in chief is held to the highest regard.\\" Trump appeared to react to the NBC report on Twitter on Monday evening. He tweeted, \\"The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don't exist).\\" He added, \\"The White House is running very smoothly.\\" In recent months, Trump has chafed at Kelly's management style, and has occasionally talked with friends about replacing him. Indeed, Trump has floated the idea of appointing Kelly to run the Department of Veterans Affairs in calls with outside allies, said two people familiar with the conversations, though there are other possibilities in the mix and the president often floats ideas without taking action. Kelly has made clear he wouldn't accept such an offer. In his early days in the White House, Kelly imposed strict controls on access and the flow of information to Trump, though his direct influence has waned somewhat since then, aides said. Kelly allies insist he has merely trained the staff to follow his management protocols, but officials note that Trump has grown more willing to act unilaterally, ignoring or simply not seeking out the advice of his top aide. The disagreements between the retired four-star general and the businessman-turned-president have grown more animated, and on one such occasion last year Kelly blasted the president as \\"an idiot\\" to staffers, the former administration official told the AP. The former official was not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations and requested anonymity. Kelly has also told confidants that he has at times served as a guardrail, protecting the American people from Trump, according to a person familiar with his views. The person, and others who spoke about private conversations, was not authorized to discuss private conversations by name and requested anonymity. Frustrated with his chief of staff, Trump has taken to paying more attention to the advice of former campaign aides like Corey Lewandowski, who appeared alongside the president at a rally in Michigan Saturday. During the rally, which one person likened to a trial, Trump called Lewandowski on stage and praised him for not being a \\"pushover\\" or a \\"patsy.\\" The president also recently told an ally that he was still frustrated by an interview that Kelly gave to Fox News more than three months ago in which he suggested that Trump had \\"evolved\\" in his thinking about the need for a wall on the Mexican border. Trump's anger about that remark — the president believed it insulted his intelligence and made him look like a flip-flopper on a signature campaign issue — was \\"the beginning of the end\\" for Kelly, according to several Trump confidants. Moreover, a number of people whom Kelly ousted or blocked from the West Wing — including Lewandowski and Anthony Scaramucci — are known to frequently fill the president's ears with attacks on the chief of staff while telling Trump that Kelly has been holding him back. Kelly's handling of domestic violence accusations against then-White House staff secretary Rob Porter earlier this year caused consternation among White House staffers, who believed Kelly wasn't truthful. The public revelation of an insult directed at the president's intelligence is reminiscent of leaks last year that then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Trump a \\"moron.\\" That episode created what White House officials described as an irreparable rift between Trump and his chief diplomat, and ultimately led to Tillerson's unceremonious March firing. Kelly said NBC's report \\"is another pathetic attempt to smear people close to President Trump and distract from the administration's many successes.\\" Still, Kelly has told people close to him that while he wanted to make the one-year mark in the position — that would mean late July — though he no longer is confident he will. Fuentes, meanwhile, said that Kelly is distressed to see his name tainted, but: \\"The reason that Kelly's here is because he believes in this country and he's a man of service.\\" \\"His relationship with the president is great, never been better,\\" he added. \\"They aren't having any issues whatsoever.\\" __ Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"White House Chief of Staff John Kelly has been reported to have eroded morale in the West Wing by allegedly insulting President Trump's intelligence and portraying himself as the savior of the country.

Article:","completion":"Title: Rising Politician Smith Embroiled in Scandal Involving Grooming and Assault of A Minor In a shocking revelation that has sent tremors through the political sphere, a prominent politician, referred to as Smith, has been accused of assaulting a 17-year-old victim while other politicians allegedly walked by, unconcerned. The young victim has come forward with harrowing details of being groomed over 18 months, with the attacks progressively worsening over time. Overcome with distress and shame, the victim shared, \\"I was and still am deeply ashamed about what I let him do to me.\\" As this distressing news comes to light, questions arise about the integrity of those in positions of power who reportedly turned a blind eye to these heinous acts. As the public attempts to process the gravity of these allegations, political consequences loom on the horizon, forcing all parties to reevaluate the values and actions they condone through their representatives. The victim's account of being groomed by the politician for over 18 months and the ensuing attacks paints a horrific picture of the abuse of power by someone who should have been a pillar of the community. This incident underscores a frightening trend of politicians exploiting their authority for nefarious purposes, taking advantage of vulnerable individuals who find it nearly impossible to escape their clutches. What is perhaps even more alarming is the apparent complacency of other politicians who purportedly walked by while the assaults were taking place. Their failure to intervene highlights the need for a more rigorous vetting process and a stronger ethical compass within our political institutions. Confronting this culture of complicity will require an unrelenting push for transparency, accountability, and justice. The victim's proclamation of being \\"deeply ashamed\\" is a heartrending reminder that survivors of abuse often carry a lasting burden of self-blame and stigma. As we prioritize the pursuit of justice, it is our collective responsibility to ensure a supportive environment for those who have been mistreated by upholding their dignity and validating their experiences. As the investigation into Smith's actions unfolds, it is crucial for all parties involved to do so with sensitivity, respect, and diligence. There is an opportunity through this horrifying incident to galvanize change in our society, which demands responsible leadership and zero tolerance for predatory behavior. Through the enactment of stricter policies, proactive monitoring, and accountability in the political system, we can work towards preventing such scandals from recurring and ensure the integrity of the leaders who govern us. In conclusion, the allegations against Smith are deeply disturbing and have exposed a revolting underbelly of abuse in the political sphere. As we strive to illuminate this darkness and hold those involved accountable, we must use this moment as a catalyst for systemic change that recognizes the vulnerability of victims, forces complicit parties to confront their silence, and champions the cause of justice and safety for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Gilda Context: Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford) and Gilda (Rita Hayworth) \\"Gilda, are you decent?\\" Johnny Farrell (Glenn Ford), a small-time American gambler newly arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, narrates. When he wins a lot of money cheating at craps, he has to be rescued from a robbery attempt by a complete stranger, Ballin Mundson (George Macready). Mundson tells him about an illegal high-class casino, but warns him not to practice his skills there. Farrell ignores his advice, cheats at blackjack, and is taken by two men to see the casino's owner, who turns out to be Mundson. Farrell talks Mundson into hiring him and quickly gains his confidence. However, the unimpressed washroom attendant, Uncle Pio (Steven Geray), keeps calling him \\"Mr. Peasant\\". One day, Mundson returns from a trip with a beautiful and spirited new wife, Gilda (Rita Hayworth). It is immediately apparent that Johnny and Gilda have a history together, though both deny it when Mundson questions them. Johnny visits Gilda alone in the bedroom she shares with her husband, and the two have an explosive confrontation that elucidates both their past romantic relationship, which ended badly, and their loveâhate dynamic. While it is unclear just how much Mundson knows of Gilda and Johnny's past relationship, he appears to be in ignorance when he assigns Farrell to keep an eye on Gilda. Johnny and Gilda are both consumed with their hatred of each other, as Gilda cavorts with men at all hours in increasingly more blatant efforts to enrage Johnny, and he grows more abusive and spiteful in his treatment of her. Mundson is visited by two German businessmen. Their secret organization had financed a tungsten cartel, with everything put in Mundson's name to hide their connection to it.

Answer:","completion":"Gilda's loyalty is complex and evolves throughout the film. Initially, it appears that Gilda is loyal to her husband, Ballin Mundson, as she marries him and becomes his spirited new wife. However, as the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that Gilda and Johnny Farrell, Mundson's right-hand man, have a tumultuous past romantic relationship that continues to influence their actions and emotions. Gilda's loyalty to Mundson begins to wane as her hatred for Johnny intensifies. She starts to cavort with other men in an attempt to enrage Johnny, displaying disloyalty to her husband. Meanwhile, Johnny becomes increasingly abusive and spiteful towards her. This mutual animosity between Gilda and Johnny drives a wedge in Gilda's relationship with Mundson. As the film progresses, it is revealed that Mundson is involved in illegal activities with the German businessmen, and his refusal to transfer ownership of the tungsten cartel puts him in a dangerous position. The police take an interest in the matter, making the situation even more precarious. In the end, Gilda's true loyalty lies with Johnny despite their love-hate relationship. After Mundson's presumed death and the unraveling of the cartel, Gilda and Johnny reunite, recognizing their lingering feelings for one another and attempting to reconcile and leave their past behind. Although their relationship is far from perfect, their connection is undeniable and ultimately overcomes the various challenges and betrayals they faced throughout the film. In summary, Gilda's loyalty is primarily to Johnny Farrell, as evidenced by their ultimate reconciliation and willingness to work through their tumultuous past. While she initially appears to be loyal to her husband, Ballin Mundson, this loyalty is overshadowed by her complicated history and unresolved feelings for Johnny."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Information: - Apatow Productions is an American film and television production company founded by Judd Apatow in 1999. - Gregory J. \\"Greg\\" Mottola (born July 11, 1964) is an American film director, screenwriter, and television director. Mottola wrote and directed the 1996 independent film \\"The Daytrippers\\", then concentrated for several years on directing in television for series such as \\"Undeclared\\" and \\"Arrested Development\\". More recently, he has directed the feature films \\"Superbad\\", \\"Adventureland\\", and \\"Paul\\". - Comedy is a genre of film in which the main emphasis is on humor. These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue. - Judd Apatow (born December 6, 1967) is an American producer, writer, director, actor, and comedian.

Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans.

Question: The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said. Chief Justice John Roberts, who often sides with conservatives on the court, said the central question was whether the cellphone information should be accessible to the government \\"without a warrant.\\" According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

A:","completion":"\\"Bookstore\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a type of retail establishment where a clerk works and assists customers in purchasing goods – in this case, primarily books. In a bookstore, customers seek and buy various books, magazines, and sometimes other related items, such as stationery or gifts. The presence of a clerk in a bookstore is quite common, as they help customers find specific books, make recommendations, manage inventory, and handle transactions at the cash register. The other mentioned answers, such as shop, post office, hotel, and airport, also involve situations where a customer might interact with a clerk. Each of these places employs personnel who perform tasks like providing information, managing transactions, and offering services to customers.

Unfortunately, with the provided context, it is not possible to pinpoint exactly what this structure or place might be. It could be another building, a mural, or even a sign outside a store or restaurant that evokes the idea of a face. The mention of \\"Lawsons,\\" which seems to be a nearby convenience store, suggests that this entire setting might be in an urban area. As you've mentioned that it was your go-to place for snacks and other items, this indicates that \\"Lawsons\\" might be a popular store chain like Lawson, a Japanese convenience store franchise, or any other locally popular convenience store brand. Furthermore, you mentioned your regret about not purchasing instant noodles at this location, which further supports the idea that the store mentioned was likely a convenience store, as they typically carry a variety of instant foods. However, this tidbit still does not provide enough information to accurately identify the \\"thing\\" with a face across the street from the hotel. To sum up, the \\"thing\\" being referred to with a sort of face is rather ambiguous and could refer to any number of different structures or features generally found in an urban setting. It is likely not related to Lawsons in any significant way, other than being in close proximity. The only way to provide a more specific identification would be to gather additional details about the surroundings, the area, the overall context, and potential local characteristics that could help narrow down the possible interpretations of the mentioned \\"face of sorts.\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.
