The movie, directed by Steve McQueen, focuses on Northup's heart-wrenching experiences, as he spends twelve long years as a slave before regaining his freedom. The narrative of \\"12 Years a Slave\\" takes place in multiple locations across the United States. The events span a period from 1841 to 1853 and are set in several key locations: 1. Saratoga Springs, New York: The movie begins in Saratoga Springs, where Solomon Northup (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) resides with his wife and children as a free man and a skilled violinist. He is lured to Washington, D.C., under the pretense of a job opportunity. 2. Washington, D.C: Upon arriving in Washington, D.C., Solomon is kidnapped and sold into slavery. This city, which still allowed slavery despite being in a free state, represents the turning point in his life. 3. Louisiana: After being sold to a slave trader, Solomon is taken to New Orleans and then transported to various plantations in Louisiana. Much of the film's narrative focuses on his time at these plantations, which include those owned by the cruel Edwin Epps (played by Michael Fassbender) and the more humane William Ford (played by Benedict Cumberbatch). The plantations depicted in \\"12 Years a Slave\\" poignantly illustrate the harsh and brutal reality of life for slaves in the southern United States during the early 19th century. Racial injustice is palpable, as Solomon and other slaves endure the dehumanizing conditions under which they are forced to live and work. In sum, \\"12 Years a Slave\\" takes place primarily in the United States' northeastern region and the Deep South, set against the backdrop of Saratoga Springs, Washington D.C., and various plantations in Louisiana. The film exposes the harrowing circumstances of life as a captive in a world that denied some people, like Solomon Northup, their most essential rights and dignity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Richard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle, the twelfth of thirteen children of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville at the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the \\"Wars of the Roses\\", a period of \\"three or four decades of political instability and periodic open civil war in the second half of the fifteenth century\\", between supporters of Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth)--\\"Yorkists\\"--in opposition to the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and those loyal to the crown (\\"Lancastrians\\"). When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. Richard's Council of the North, described as his \\"one major institutional innovation\\", derived from his ducal council following his own viceregal appointment by Edward IV; when Richard himself became king, he maintained the same conciliar structure in his absence. It officially became part of the royal council machinery under the presidency of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in April 1484, based at Sandal Castle in Wakefield. It is considered to have greatly improved conditions for northern England, as it was, in theory at least, intended to keep the peace and punish law breakers, as well as resolving land disputes. Bringing regional governance directly under the control of central government, it has been described as the king's \\"most enduring monument\\", surviving unchanged until 1641. In December 1483, Richard instituted what later became known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal representation could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts. Richard's death at Bosworth resulted in the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, which had ruled England since the succession of Henry II in 1154. The last legitimate male Plantagenet, Richard's nephew, Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of Richard III's brother Clarence), was executed by Henry VII in 1499. The only extant direct male line of Plantagenets is the House of Beaufort, headed today by Henry Somerset, 12th Duke of Beaufort. But the Beaufort line was barred from the succession by Henry IV. Were there any other notable figures that worked with Richard III on the Court of Requests?","completion":"Alright child, let me tell you a story. A long time ago, there was a man named Richard III who lived in England. He was born on October 2, 1452, in a castle. Richard was a part of a big family, and his dad was an important man who wanted to be king. There were two groups of people, called Yorkists and Lancastrians, who were fighting for the throne. When Richard was very young, his dad and older brother Edmund sadly died in a battle. Later, another brother of Richard became King Edward IV. Richard wanted to make things better in his country, so he created a special group called the Council of the North to help with problems and make sure people followed the laws. He also made a place called the Court of Requests, where people could go when they had problems and needed help. This was especially helpful for people who didn't have much money. Richard made many other good changes, too. He made sure that buying and selling land was fair, he helped protect people who were accused of crimes, and he made sure that written laws were in English, so more people could understand them. But, one sad day, Richard died in a battle, and it marked the end of a very old family that had ruled England for a very long time. Now, you asked if there were other important people who worked with Richard on the Court of Requests, right? Unfortunately, we don't know their names, but we do know that they worked together to help those in need. Remember, the Court of Requests was a place where people, even ones with not much money, could go for help with their problems. This was a very important job, and Richard and those who worked with him made a big difference in their country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If your room is too warm, try to cool it down by opening a window, using fewer blankets, or turning a fan or air conditioning. If your room is too cold, try to wear warmer clothing to sleep or using more blankets.

When Wednesday refuses to participate in the Thanksgiving play, they are punished by being forced to watch upbeat Disney and family films. However, afterwards, Wednesday pretends to be cheerful and agrees to be part of the play, but only to plot a revolt against Camp Chippewa.

When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team lead a less safer experiment? Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. A:","completion":"Team A led a less safe experiment because they heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, which could result in the can exploding due to increased pressure inside."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Orci was born in Mexico City on July 20, 1973, to a Mexican father and a Cuban mother. His mother immigrated to the United States with her parents after Fidel Castro came to power. Orci grew up in Mexico, and moved with his family to the United States at the age of 10. He was raised in Texas, Los Angeles and Canada. Context: Orci's first credit solely as a producer came with the film Eagle Eye, where he worked once again alongside Kurtzman. He said in an interview with the magazine Extra that he had previously been involved in productions where the producers had writing backgrounds and had looked to them for help, and he was happy to provide that same support to the writers on Eagle Eye. The director of the film, D. J. Caruso, praised the duo saying that \\"What's unusually cool about them is that they have maintained the producer-writer power that they earned in television and carried that over into the feature film area, and that is extremely rare.\\" Following their work on Eagle Eye, they were executive producers on the Sandra Bullock film, The Proposal. Despite their film careers, Orci and Kurtzman continued to create television series. These included Sleepy Hollow, which they developed alongside Phillip Iscove. They pitched the series to a number of networks, and it was picked up by Fox. Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television, with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew. It was created for Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network, and Rodriguez's one demand of the show was that he could direct the pilot episode. Orci later explained in an interview that it was an easy decision, and he needed to pretend to consider it. Orci and Kurtzman also worked together as executive producers on the animated television series, Transformers: Prime, due to their involvement with the live action movies. Following the end of the series they were hopeful to be involved in a future animated series based on the premise, which Orci saw less like a reboot of the show and more of a continuation in a different guise. He felt that while Prime was sophisticated, there were concerns that it was leaving younger viewers behind because of its complexity and intensity. Question: what did the producer-power do. Whats the answer?","completion":"So, the producer-power, which is Orci and Kurtzman, is a team that makes movies and television shows. They help create stories, find the right people to work on them, and make sure everything goes smoothly so the movie or show turns out great.

After everyone has left and they are no closer to an answer, Annie realizes that one person did not come to the dinner, so Jackie pays a late-night visit to the only absentee: the reclusive Ned Devine (Jimmy Keogh). He finds Ned in his home in front of the TV, still holding the ticket in his hand, a smile on his face and dead from shock. That same night, Jackie has a dream that the deceased Ned wants to share the winnings with his friends, as he has no family to claim the ticket.

What is the answer?","completion":"The Samoyed breed of dog originated in Siberia, specifically in northwestern Russia. The Samoyed, named after the indigenous Samoyedic peoples who lived in the region, was initially bred for various purposes, including herding, hunting, and sled-pulling in the harsh Siberian climate. The Samoyed people belonged to the larger Uralic group, residing in areas around the Ob River, Karelia, and the Yenisei River. They mostly lived a nomadic lifestyle, relying on reindeer for their survival and moving seasonally to various locations. The Samoyed served as invaluable companions in these challenging conditions, mainly due to their strong work ethic, impressive endurance, and adaptable nature. Additionally, the Samoyed had a remarkable rapport with their human families, resulting in a unique bond. These dogs were not only instrumental in day-to-day tasks but also provided warmth on cold nights by sleeping close to their human companions, becoming living blankets. The Samoyed breed is instantly recognizable by their dense, double-layered white coat, which serves as effective insulation against the extreme cold. They also have a trademark \\"Samoyed smile,\\" characterized by upturned corners of their mouths, and a distinctive foxy expression thanks to their wedge-shaped head, almond-shaped eyes, and erect, triangular ears. The breed's outgoing, friendly temperament and strong working instincts have continued to make the Samoyed a popular choice among dog owners worldwide. The first Samoyeds came to Europe in the late 19th century, attracting the attention of dog enthusiasts and quickly gaining popularity, which further expanded to the United States soon after. In modern times, the Samoyed can be seen participating in dog shows, excelling in various dog sports, and undertaking a variety of roles, from therapy dogs to family pets. Affectionate, intelligent, and social, this Siberian breed has maintained its enduring appeal for centuries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - People dig up coal from the ground - People burn coal for heat or electricity - Pollution from the coal goes into the sky - Coal pollution enters clouds - Clouds rain over an area - The polluted rain becomes acid rain. Question: suppose the government regulates coal emissions happens, how will it affect more acid rain forms. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If the government regulates coal emissions effectively, it will likely result in less acid rain formation. The supposed perturbation, which is the regulation of coal emissions in this case, will mainly influence the release of pollution from the coal burning process. When coal emissions are regulated, it means that there will be controls and limitations in place to reduce the amount and type of pollutants that are released into the atmosphere. These controls may include stricter laws, cleaner technologies, and better management practices. As a result of these measures, there will be a reduction in the amount of pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, being released into the air. Since sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the key contributors to acid rain formation, a reduction in their emissions will consequently lead to a reduced likelihood of acid rain formation. As the pollution that enters the clouds becomes less acidic, the rain that falls over an area will also be less acidic. In summary, an effective government regulation of coal emissions will have a positive impact by reducing the chances of acid rain formation. This perturbation will influence the second effect mentioned – acid rain – by causing it to occur less frequently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Step 2: Compare the components of the premise and the hypothesis. - The components of the hypothesis are all included in the premise, except for one phrase \\"have a stake.\\" Step 3: Analyze the importance of the missing component. - The phrase \\"have a stake in\\" from the premise highlights that employees are not just participating in the process, but they also have a vested interest in the outcomes.

It is important to acknowledge that there are wide variations among individuals in both populations, and these generalizations cannot apply to everyone. 1. Israeli people: Israel is a diverse country that has welcomed Jews from all over the world. Therefore, Israeli facial features might vary depending on the individual's ancestry. However, some common traits may include: - Olive to fair skin tone - Dark brown or green eyes - Curly or wavy hair, ranging from light to dark brown or black - A prominent or straight nose 2. Arab people: Arabs represent a large population spread across the Middle East and North Africa. They, too, exhibit a wide range of facial features due to differences in genetics and geography. Some shared characteristics might be: - Olive to darker skin tone - Brown or dark brown eyes - Straight or wavy hair, typically dark brown or black - A curved or straight nose, sometimes with a prominent bridge To answer your second question: No, the questions are not the same, as they are inquiring about the common facial features of two different groups of people.

Summarize this article: The 37-year-old closed with a bogey-free three-under-par 67 to hold off Australia's world number one Jason Day (67) and win on 14 under. American Daniel Summerhays (66) was third on 10 under, while Open champion Henrik Stenson faded with a 71 to finish joint seventh on eight under. \\"It is surreal, an incredible finish,\\" said Walker, ranked 48th in the world. England's Tyrrell Hatton (68) and Paul Casey (67) ended on seven under. For the first time since 2011, all four of the year's majors have been claimed by first-time winners. England's Danny Willett won the Masters in April, American Dustin Johnson took the US Open in June, while Swede Stenson won the Open two weeks ago. He opened his week with a five-under 65 to lead the tournament and followed it with a 66 to hold the halfway lead on nine under with American Robert Streb. Walker did not play on Saturday, when the threat of storms forced play to be abandoned, but returned with 49 others on Sunday morning for round three. He carded a 68 to take a one-shot lead over defending champion Day, who had shot a 67, into the afternoon's final round. Walker holed half-a-dozen putts of between three and five feet as he opened with nine straight pars to reach the turn on 11 under. He then pitched in from a bunker on the 10th for a birdie and followed that with a 30-foot putt on the next to get to 13 under. A run of five pars was ended by a third birdie on the par-five 17th, but it turned out to be a more nervy finish than Walker would have hoped for. With a three-shot lead on the last, he opted for the safety of an iron off the tee. But then Day rolled in a 14-foot eagle putt to close the deficit to one and Walker then hit his second shot into greenside rough. He chipped his third to 35 feet and had two putts for the win, eventually holing from three feet to seal the title. \\"I made it a little more difficult than I would have liked but I did it,\\" said Walker. Defending champion Day and Stenson, who had earlier posted a third successive 67 in round three to reach nine under, were both within one shot of Walker during the final round but neither were able to catch the American. Two bogeys in his opening three holes meant Day dropped back to eight under but he holed three birdies in seven holes from the fifth to get to 11 under. Although he finished with an eagle, the six pars that preceded it proved costly. \\"The eagle was nice,\\" said Day. \\"I had to step up and do something and I hit two good shots with my two-iron. \\"I wanted to give Jimmy something to think about but it wasn't quite enough.\\" Stenson looked the more likely to challenge after a birdie on the sixth got him to 10 under, but, like many, he struggled with the pace of rain-soaked greens. He then sent his approach to the 15th over the back of the green and looked a beaten man after fluffing a chip and carding a double-bogey six. He finished tied with Martin Kaymer as the top European after the German eagled the par-five 18th to close with a four-under-par 66 and eight under total. England's Justin Rose (68) and Scotland's Russell Knox (69) both finished on four under for the championship. Ross Fisher's 69 moved him up to two under, alongside Welshman Jamie Donaldson (70) and one ahead of fellow Englishmen Matthew Fitzpatrick (67) and Andy Sullivan (69). Andrew Johnston delighted his new-found fans with a birdie on the last to finish with a one-over 71 to finish one over par. Masters champion Danny Willett closed with a level-par 70 to finish five over, as did Wales' Bradley Dredge, while England's Lee Westwood finished with a double-bogey seven on the last in a round of 75 to finish seven over.

Mike flees from Boulton mortuary in the hearse, while Reggie is trapped inside by The Tall Man's spheres. Rather than kill Reggie, The Tall Man lets him go, saying he is doing so \\"to play one last game\\", then The Tall Man leaves Boulton. Mike's brother Jody, now a steel sphere that can occasionally resume its human form, persuades a reluctant Reggie to go looking for Mike. On the way, Reggie is attacked by a mysterious psychopathic demon disguised as a police officer. Reggie escapes only after shooting, stabbing, and immolating the demon. Later, Reggie rescues a woman named Jennifer from her overturned car and takes her to the next town. They stay the night at an abandoned motel where Reggie tells her the story of The Tall Man. A disbelieving Jennifer rejects his advances before Reggie falls asleep and dreams of Mike. Disturbed, Reggie seeks solace from Jennifer and discovers she has two spheres where her breasts should be. The spheres attack Reggie, who manages to destroy one with a sledgehammer but is pinned to the wall by the other. In desperation he strikes his tuning fork and the sphere explodes. Reggie then dispatches the demon Jennifer with the sledgehammer before leaving. Mike, trying to uncover the mysteries of The Tall Man in order to escape his transformation, drives through abandoned towns and remembers the last days of his youth before The Tall Man's arrival.

My partner’s parents decided to help with all the planning and set up for his sister’s wedding. I am sure part of the reason was because they had offered to foot part of the expenses. There came a point in the planning, when his mom seemed to sort of run-amok with her ideas. His sister ended up accepting some plans for her wedding that I don’t think she was really that fond of, but she went along with them anyways. One of the things that stands out the most to me, was this idea that they would make a large wooden box with a hole in it, and people would smash their dinner plates into the box. Then the fragments of the broken plates would be put into metal keepsake tins for the guests to take home. (The tins were cute, the trash inside seemed very weird to me.) So imagine it’s the evening of your wedding reception, and people are in a corner of the room smashing their plates into a box. And then part of your wedding party is supposed to go in the back and fix up the tins of broken ceramic ware. It was like an exercise in how to needlessly generate extra stress hormones in a large room full of people. My partner’s sister looked like she cringed every time someone threw a plate in the box. It is weird (and wasteful) to propose to break brand new plates for a tradition that isn’t even part of your ancestry. It’s weird to railroad the people getting married into accepting to do things they don’t really want. Soon after that, my partner’s mother offered that she would be happy to help us plan and throw our wedding too, just like they did for his sister. I think the experience made us both content to elope. Question: After the end of the story the partner is feeling how about having mother involved in planning her wedding? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"After the end of the story, the partner is likely feeling hesitant and apprehensive about having her partner's mother involved in planning her wedding. The experience at her partner's sister's wedding, where the mother seemed to take over the planning process and imposed her own ideas, left her feeling uneasy. Witnessing the sister's discomfort in accepting plans that she didn't genuinely want, and the stress generated by unnecessary activities like breaking dinner plates, made the partner question whether having her partner's mother involved in planning her own wedding would be a wise decision. Moreover, the wasteful nature of the plate-breaking tradition and its lack of connection to the couple's ancestry added to the partner's bewilderment. She is likely concerned that her partner's mother might inadvertently impose her own taste and preferences on her wedding, rather than ensuring that the couple's wishes and preferences are respected and incorporated. This fear is reinforced by the fact that her partner's sister seemed to accept plans she wasn't fond of, just to please her mother. This entire experience made the partner lean more towards the idea of eloping, as it would allow them to avoid the stress and potential conflicts with her partner's mother during the planning phase of their wedding. Overall, the partner is feeling cautious and uneasy about involving her partner's mother in the planning of her wedding, and instead, would prefer a more intimate and personalized celebration that reflects their unique tastes and desires as a couple."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Photo: Tony Leys/The Register)Buy Photo Donna Rayhons may have responded positively to her husband's hugs and kisses, but that doesn't prove she was mentally capable of consenting to sex, one of her doctors testified Monday. The issue could be key to whether Henry Rayhons winds up being convicted of sexually abusing his wife, who was living in a nursing home here. Dr. John Brady, who is medical director of Concord Care Center, testified that Donna Rayhons had severe dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. He said any positive reaction to her husband's affectionate advances could be termed a \\"primal response,\\" not a conscious decision to reciprocate. MORE: Was Henry Rayhons a loving husband or selfish abuser? Defense lawyer Joel Yunek pressed the doctor on the matter. \\"If the testimony is that Donna is happy to see Henry — hugs, smiles, they hold hands, they talk — would that indicate that she is in fact capable at that point of understanding the affection with Henry?\\" Yunek asked. \\"No,\\" Brady answered. He likened the situation to the instinctive response of a baby to affection shown by a mother. The lawyer asked: \\"Isn't a primal response a decision that we make?\\" No, the doctor said. \\"I don't believe an infant makes an informed decision.\\" CLOSE Witnesses testified to Donna Rayhons' mental state during trial proceedings Monday in Garner, Ia. Brady is one of several healthcare professionals who have testified on behalf of the prosecution in the unusual trial. Henry Rayhons, 78, is charged with a felony for allegedly having sex with his wife last May after Brady determined she no longer had the mental capacity to consent. Rayhons, a former state legislator, has denied any wrongdoing in his actions toward his wife, who died last August. Brady testified Monday that Donna Rayhons had declined rapidly in the months before the incident last May 23. He said she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's based on several tests. One was a standard cognitive test, in which patients are asked simple questions, such as what day it is or whether they can repeat back three words that are spoken to them. By last May, Brady said, Donna Rayhons scored a zero on the test. Any score below eight signifies severe impairment, he said. PREVIOUSLY: Henry Rayhons' stepchild denies that bitterness played a role Two other doctors who testified for the prosecution Friday also said they were confident Donna Rayhons was suffering severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. One of the doctors, neurologist Alireza Yarahmadi, disputed any notion that such an Alzheimer's patient could vary greatly in her ability to understand what was going on around her. \\"When they're severe, they're going to stay severe,\\" Yarahmadi testified. Yunek, the defense lawyer, has been suggesting that dementia patients have \\"good days and bad days,\\" in which they're more or less capable of making decisions. Yunek also has suggested that even if they lose cognitive abilities, dementia patients maintain an emotional ability to reject activities, such as hugging or kissing. The neurologist disagreed with that idea. \\"They do have feelings, but they don't have good judgment,\\" Yarahmadi said. On Monday morning, the prosecution showed jurors security camera video from the night of the alleged incident. The silent, black-and-white video, shot in the nursing home's hallways, shows Donna Rayhons wandering around the hall. Then it shows Henry Rayhons walking into the facility and going into her room with her. He stays in the room about 28 minutes. Near the end of that time, a nurse's aide goes into the room, reportedly to answer a call light from Donna Rayhons' roommate. Prosecution witnesses have said the roommate was upset by sounds she heard from behind a curtain, which authorities contend were from sex. The defense denies the couple had sex. This still photo, taken from a video from security cameras at the Concord Care Center in Garner, shows Rayhons dropping his wife’s underwear in a laundry cart after leaving her room last May 23. Prosecutors allege he was trying to hide evidence that he’d just had sex with his wife, but the defense lawyer has said Henry Rayhons often placed his wife’s dirty laundry in the hamper. (Photo: Special to the Register) At the end of the video shown to jurors, Henry Rayhons comes out of the room, walks down the hall and drops something into a laundry cart. Nursing Director Laura Studer testified that a staff member later retrieved Donna Rayhons' underwear from the laundry. Yunek said in his opening statement last week that his client often put his wife's dirty laundry in the cart, although prosecutors contend Henry Rayhons was trying to stash evidence of his misdeed. Studer testified that the facility's staff called police about the incident. She said they are required by state law to report any suspicions of criminal activity in the facility. She denied that Donna Rayhons' daughters instigated the report. Yunek has said his client was at the losing end of a power struggle with two of his stepdaughters, who didn't like the way he wanted Donna to continue living as normal a life as possible. In cross-examining prosecution witnesses Monday afternoon, Yunek tried to heighten doubts about whether the couple had sex that evening. One of the witnesses was Luann Engels-Hepker, a Mason City nurse who specializes in examining sex abuse victims. She described how she performed a thorough examination on Donna Rayhons that night after the police chief brought the elderly woman to the hospital. Rayhons did not appear agitated, but also did not seem to understand what was going on, Engels-Hepker testified. Under Yunek's questioning, the nurse said she found no signs of physical injury, though she said that doesn't necessarily mean a person wasn't abused. It could just mean there wasn't a lot of force used, she said. The jury also heard from former nursing home staff nurse Shari Dakin, who recounted how Donna Rayhons' roommate became distraught after the alleged incident. The roommate indicated Henry Rayhons had done something awful after pulling a curtain shielding his wife's bed from the roommate's view. \\"She said she just hated that man, just hated him,\\" Dakin said. The roommate told staff members she knew what the sounds were. \\"I'm not stupid. I know what was going on behind that curtain,\\" Dakin recalled her saying. The defense lawyer asked Dakin if the roommate ever specifically said the sounds were from sex. \\"No,\\" the nurse replied, \\"but she insinuated very strongly that's what it was.\\" Monday afternoon, the judge told jurors they would not be hearing testimony in the case Tuesday but the trial should resume Wednesday. Yunek told reporters afterward that the interruption was because of an emergency in his family. Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1yoGZMp ||||| GARNER, Iowa – Concord Care Center staff continue their testimony in the trial of Henry Rayhons which includes the first look at surveillance footage from May 23, 2014. Physicians and nurses from the Concord Care Center testified that Donna Rayhons, wife of former Iowa legislator, Henry Rayhons was in no place mentally to give consent to any sexual interactions with her husband. Rayhons is on trial for allegedly engaging in a sex act with Donna, who had been diagnosed with dementia and deemed unfit to give consent. Dr. John Brady was first to take the stand as the primary physician for the Concord Care Center. He described the downward decline of Donna’s mental state and her capacity for decision-making. He says given Donna’s decreasing score on the BIMS (Brief Interview for Mental Status), he determined Donna lacked the cognitive ability to give consent to sex. On May 15, during a care conference between Henry, staff and the daughters of Donna, the topic of sex between spouses was discussed briefly. In the document provided to all parties, the document asks, “Given Donna’s cognitive state, do you feel she is able to give consent for any sexual activity?” To which Dr. Brady writes, “no” and then later signs his initials. Dr. Brady says in his 20 years of practicing medicine, this is the first time he has ever been asked to make a judgement about a person’s mental capacity to have sex with their spouse while in nursing home care. Later, Laura Studer, Director of Nursing at the care facility gave her testimony on the events of May 23. After being made aware of an incident regarding Henry and Donna where sex may have been involved, she reviewed the surveillance tapes. There, she says you can see Donna being redirected to her room by Henry, after she had wandered through the halls. Nearly 30 minutes later, Henry is seen leaving the room and walking down the hallway. He would stop and drop something, later discovered to be Donna’s underwear, in the laundry hamper. Studer says outside of the concerns addressed by Donna’s roommate, no other care staff recalled anything out of the ordinary. It was only until Donna’s roommate alerted staff by saying, “I know what I heard, I’m not stupid.” From there staff began investigating what they believed to be sexual abuse. Luanne Engels-Hepker, administered the sexual abuse exam on Donna and says that she was unable to find any secretions, or any evidence of damage to Donna’s vagina. In cross-exam, Engels-Hepker says Donna was very cooperative and did not restrict the investigation in any way. According to prosecutors, it was later discovered the same underwear thrown in the laundry hamper contained seminal fluid consistent with the DNA of Henry Rayhons. Several nurses, care specialists and even a local police officer took to the stand to testify to Donna’s cognitive abilities. Head charge nurse, Shari Dakin explained how Donna was often times, “in her own little world.” Others like nurse, Patricia Barrick illustrated the extent of Donna’s dementia by recalling an event when she met Donna for a meal. “She was holding a sandwich like this and looking down and just shaking your head. What do I do? Not saying that, but just looking blankly at the food,” said Barrick. Barrick says it was then that she began to notice a sharp decline in Donna’s cognitive functions.

The case revolves around whether she was mentally capable of consenting to sex. Dr. John Brady, medical director of the nursing home, testified that any positive reaction to her husband's advances was a \\"primal response\\" and not a conscious decision to reciprocate. The defense argued that dementia patients can have \\"good days and bad days\\" and maintain emotional ability to reject activities, but the neurologist disagreed, claiming they have feelings but lack good judgment.

Taking advantage of gaming laws that allow him to work in a casino while his gaming licence is pending, Sam doubles the casino's profits, which are skimmed by the mafia before they are reported to income tax agencies.

Sam meets and falls in love with a hustler and former prostitute, Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone). They conceive a daughter and marry, but their marriage is proven difficult by Ginger's strong independence and love for her former boyfriend, con artist-turned pimp Lester Diamond (James Woods), who is ordered beaten severely by Sam and Nicky after they catch him conning Ginger out of some money. Ginger subsequently turns to alcohol. Meanwhile, Sam makes an enemy in county commissioner Pat Webb (L. Q. Jones) for firing his brother-in-law Don Ward (John Bloom) for incompetence. When Sam refuses to reinstate him, Webb pulls Sam's licence from the backlog, forcing him to face a hearing for his gaming licence while secretly arranging for the board to deny Sam. Sam blames the incident on Nicky's recklessness and the two argue furiously in the desert after Sam attempts to tell Nicky to leave Las Vegas.

I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity don't exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it.

Q:You are given a new situation: A scientist named Kathy walks into her office to see two neon signs plugged into the wall and hanging above her desk. Confused, she looks around to see if there's any clue as to who put them there. Seeing nobody, she flips the light switch on and walks in. Upon flipping the light switch, only the large sign lights up. Even though they are clearly both plugged in, the small sign isn't turning on. Kathy leaves her office to find someone to ask who put these random signs up in her room. and a hint : Noble gases are also used to fill the glass tubes of lighted signs like the one in the Figure below . Although noble gases are chemically nonreactive, their electrons can be energized by sending an electric current through them. When this happens, the electrons jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original energy level, they give off energy as light. Different noble gases give off light of different colors. Neon gives off reddish-orange light, like the word “Open” in the sign below. Krypton gives off violet light and xenon gives off blue light. Please answer this question : Are the electrons in the small sign more or less energized than the large sign's electrons? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it appears that the small neon sign is not functioning properly as it does not light up when Kathy flips the switch, unlike the large sign. In contrast, the large sign is working properly and emits light upon switching it on. The electrons in the small sign seem to be in their original energy levels since the sign is not emitting any light. They are not energized enough to jump to higher energy levels, which is required for the emission of light. On the other hand, the electrons in the large sign are being energized as an electric current passes through them. This causes the electrons to jump to higher energy levels and, upon returning to their original energy levels, emit energy as light. Considering these factors, it can be stated that the electrons in the large sign are more energized compared to those in the small sign. The malfunction or lack of functionality in the small sign might be due to several reasons such as faulty wiring, insufficient electrical current, or problems with the noble gas content in the tubes. However, from the provided information, we can conclude that the electrons in the small sign are less energized than the large sign's electrons, as the small sign is not emitting light as it should."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a new situation: John is studying a species in two similar countries, country A and country B. Country A has large population, but country B has small population of that species. John is pondering about how this species would fare in the future in these two countries. But I can use this background: In nature, when the population size is small, there is usually plenty of food and other resources for each individual. When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. What is an answer for this question: Would country A see higher or lower growth rate of the species than country B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, country A, with a large population of the species, is likely to experience more competition for resources such as food. As a result, individuals in country A may struggle to reproduce at a high rate, which would lead to a decrease in population growth rate. On the other hand, country B has a smaller population, which means there would be more abundant resources available per individual. This relatively abundant food and other resources could enable the organisms in country B to reproduce more easily, leading to higher birth rates and an increased population growth rate. Therefore, in this scenario, country B would likely see a higher growth rate of the species compared to country A due to the difference in population sizes and the availability of resources."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The process you described is related to the operations of the human renal system, more specifically, the role of kidneys in waste management and water regulation in the body. The nephrons in the kidneys filter out wastes and excess water from the blood, leaving only the necessary nutrients and electrolytes. The cleaned blood is then routed back into the body's circulation, while the waste and excess water are converted into urine, excreted from the body through the urinary system. The scenario envisaged about the absence of lava in the volcanic chambers has no direct relationship to the renal process described above and thus wouldn't have an effect on it. Volcanic activities, such as lava flow, occur on a geological scale and are part of Earth's way of renewing its surface. This is a wholly physical process involving the Earth's tectonic plates and has no direct interaction with biological systems such as the renal system. On a larger scale, if volcanic activity were to reduce significantly due to the absence of lava, it might create impacts on the global climate, such as a slight cooling effect due to fewer volcanic emissions - gases and particles that can block sunlight. But even these changes won't affect the function of kidneys. Hence, if there's no lava in the chambers, it will have no effect on the process of the kidneys expelling excess water and waste from the body.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Our family had been staying at Grandview for many years. We have enjoyed the rooms, pool, and location in the past. However the quality of the customer service and the basic maintenance and cleanliness of the property has declined to such a low, that we will no longer choose Grandview as our place to stay when we visit Las Vegas. During our stay in September 2011 there were several issues with our rooms. Light bulbs out, missing sink parts, etc. that we had to get taken care of when we checked in. Then during the stay there was some kind of fire on our floor which triggered the sprinklers and flooded the hall. We were not informed that there was a fire, evacuated, or anything. Then when we asked about the flooding, carpet pulled up, huge loud fans, etc. we were told the fire department had sprayed it down and caused the damage (which the manager denied later, saying it was only the sprinklers). The whole floor began to stink terrible on top of the noise. We were never given the option to move to another floor or building. When we brought this all to the attention of the Front Desk Manager, he apologized and said that the next time we come he will make sure we have a \\"VIP room\\" where he would personally make sure everything in the room is perfect and he insisted that an apology gift of a fruit basket (or similar) would await us. When I made my reservation for our next trip in November 2012 I called him and he told me that he couldn't write down the VIP thing right then and I would have to call when it got closer to the check in date to remind him. Quite a lot of work for me, to get the apology executed. I did as he asked and he said everything would be ready when we came, however, when we got to the rooms there were things missing and dirty and there was no basket. So the \\"VIP\\" experience did not happen at all. It was just as bad a before and no efforts were made to make it better for us. When we spoke to the same manager about the issues and the basket he sent someone to fix things (which took a long time out of our vacation) and then said they had \\"run out\\" of baskets so we were just going to have to do without. Really? At this point we were ready to say never mind, let's go somewhere else and never return, but being nice and reasonable people we wanted to give them another chance to make things right. Our last trip was May 2013. What we encountered was beyond our worst nightmares. Not only was the room filthy with fingerprints, stains, black mold, etc., but all the furniture was banged up, holes in the walls, paint on lamp shades, etc. When we went to cook dinner the usual mini salt/pepper was missing and when we called the front desk to have them send one up, they said they don't provide that anymore. So we had to stop cooking and run to the store to buy a large shaker of each, which we had to leave behind since we were flying home. The first night the shower was clogged and it was backing up into the sinks (disgusting). Someone came to clean out the drain and then housekeeping had to come clean up their mess. A few days later the toilet would not flush correctly and we had to have another person come fix that. We washed our clothes in the washer machine in the unit prior to flying home and found there were these greasy looking spots all over everything. Some of the clothes have been ruined. To top it all off there was a dead roach in our room that wasn't there when we checked in. On top of the issues with the room, we were lied to and accosted by the sales team. At check in we were told that you wanted people who had not seen the new building to view the new rooms and give feedback in a short survey about what we liked about the rooms. For doing the survey we would get a coupon for a free lunch buffet and a gift card for the Cosmopolitan. We asked if this was a timeshare thing and were told absolutely not, it was just a short, no time commitment survey. We were interested in seeing the new rooms, especially since we had been having such issues with the current rooms, so we agreed. They took 20 cash to hold our spot, which we thought was weird for a survey. The day of the tour the salesman who picked us up walked us over to the South Point and literally watched us eat our buffet. That was the most unprofessional and creepy thing ever. I guess the goal was to get us to hurry up so we did not enjoy our meal. Then we went over to the Iris building that we were staying in and looked at a model room that was nothing \\"new\\", followed by a timeshare pitch.

I read this background article the other day: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. I am facing a new situation today: Dr. Bill studies 2 groups of patients, group S composed of individuals with siclke-cell anemia, and group N with normal blood and no health issues. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group had people with less hemoglobin clumping together? A:","completion":"Group N, composed of individuals with normal blood and no health issues, would have people with less hemoglobin clumping together. This is because they do not have the mutation in the gene for hemoglobin that causes the structural change leading to the clumping effect found in sickle-cell anemia (which affects group S)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the derivative of [math]ax^2 +2hxy+by^2=1[/math]? My parents think I'm trying to replace them with my boyfriend's parents. How can I convince them this is not the case? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: 1). no 2). yes","completion":"1) Derivative: A derivative is like finding out the speed at which something changes. Imagine you're riding a bike and you want to know how fast you're going uphill or downhill. In math, we use derivatives to find how fast a curve is changing at any point. The equation you provided, ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 = 1, is for a shape called an ellipse. But this equation has two variables, x and y, so we can't directly find the derivative like we do for simple functions with only one variable. However, we can find partial derivatives, which are like finding how fast the shape changes in just the left-right (x) direction or the up-down (y) direction at a specific point (x, y). For the x direction, we'll find the partial derivative with respect to x (denoted as ∂/∂x): ∂/∂x (ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2) = 2ax + 2hy. For the y direction, we'll find the partial derivative with respect to y (denoted as ∂/∂y): ∂/∂y (ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2) = 2hx + 2by. These partial derivatives tell us how fast the curve is changing at a point (x, y) in the x and y directions. 2) Parents problem: Think of your family as a special team, and each person in your family is a valuable team member, like in a soccer game. Your parents are worried that you like your boyfriend's parents (another team) more than your own team. To convince your parents that you don't want to replace them, spend more time with them and show them love, like hugging, talking, and sharing your feelings. Also, tell them that they are important to you and that no one can replace them. You can still be friends with your boyfriend's parents, but your own parents will always be your special team. 3) Multi-choice problem: These two questions are different.

Would \\"It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"Low self-esteem refers to an individual's negative evaluation of their own self-worth or intrinsic value. It encompasses the thoughts, emotions, and beliefs they hold about themselves. A person with low self-esteem tends to harbor feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, and a lack of confidence in their abilities. It can manifest in various aspects of one's life, such as personal relationships, academic achievements, professional growth, and social interactions. The statement, \\"It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self,\\" is indeed a reasonable answer to describe low self-esteem since it accurately captures the essence of both the cognitive and emotional aspects of this phenomenon. Let's break this statement down into two parts to provide further clarity: 1. Judgement of oneself: Low self-esteem arises when individuals perceive themselves negatively, focusing on their shortcomings and perceived failures. They may have a tendency to compare themselves unfavorably with others and believe they do not measure up. These critical judgments, often rooted in past experiences or internalized messages from others, feed a distorted self-image that does not accurately reflect their true capabilities or worth. 2. Attitude toward the self: This component highlights the emotional and behavioral consequences of negative self-evaluations. Individuals with low self-esteem may demonstrate a pervasive lack of confidence, insecurity, and self-deprecation. They may be overly sensitive to criticism, prone to self-blame, and experience heightened feelings of shame, guilt, or worthlessness. The negative attitude toward oneself may also lead to the development of self-defeating behaviors, such as excessive perfectionism, procrastination, social withdrawal, and avoidance of challenges or opportunities for growth. Low self-esteem can be influenced by various factors, including upbringing, personality traits, mental health issues, trauma, or societal pressures and expectations. Addressing and overcoming low self-esteem typically involves identifying and challenging distorted self-beliefs, cultivating self-awareness and self-compassion, fostering positive relationships, and developing coping strategies to cope with life's challenges. In conclusion, low self-esteem is a multifaceted phenomenon that involves both the judgment of oneself and an attitude toward the self, which contribute to a person's overall sense of personal worth and competence. The statement provided accurately captures this concept and encourages a broader perspective on the complexities of self-esteem and its impact on individuals' lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His last ride came in 1999. He currently lives with his wife in Asheboro, North Carolina. He is the brother of former fellow NASCAR competitor Jim Bown. Context: In 1994, Bown moved back up to the Cup series, driving the No. 12 Ford Thunderbird for Bobby Allison. He won the pole for the Food City 500, setting a new track record. He was seriously injured in a wreck at Pocono Raceway which sidelined him for the season. Bown returned to racing in 1995 in four Busch races, finishing ninth at Charlotte Motor Speedway in the No. 05 Key Motorsports Ford. He competed in nine Cup races in the No. 32 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for Active Motorsports, his best finish a 21st at Charlotte. In 1996, Bown drove for a variety of teams in the Busch Series, his best finish 21st at Darlington Raceway. He drove the Sadler Brothers Racing' No. 95 Ford in three Winston Cup Series events but only finished one race. In 1997, Bown began racing in the Craftsman Truck Series, driving the No. 99 Ford F-150 for Roush Racing. Despite not winning a race, he had four top-fives and finished ninth in the standings. The next season, Bown qualified on the pole at the season opener at Walt Disney World Speedway, but finished 25th. After that race, he was released from Roush due to downsizing. He movted to the No. 57 CSG Motorsports Ford driving in six events before being released. He ended the season driving the No. 67 Chevrolet Silverado in a pair of races, finishing seventeenth at Phoenix. In 1999, Bown returned to Hensley to drive their No. 63 Chevrolet. Despite a seventh-place finish at Charlotte, Bown was released from the team halfway into the season, and soon retired. Question: What did Chuck Bown do in his final years? Answer:","completion":"In Chuck Bown's final years as a professional race car driver, he faced multiple challenges and transitions in his career, moving between different racing series and teams. In 1997, he joined the Craftsman Truck Series, driving for Roush Racing's No. 99 Ford F-150. Although he did not win any races, he secured four top-five placements and finished ninth in the overall standings. In 1998, the season started on a high note with Bown qualifying on pole at Walt Disney World Speedway, but he only managed to finish 25th in the race. Due to Roush Racing downsizing, he was released from the team after this event. Bown then moved to CSG Motorsports to drive the No. 57 Ford in six events, but he was released from the team as well. He concluded 1998 by participating in two races driving the No. 67 Chevrolet Silverado, securing a 17th place finish at Phoenix. Bown's final year in racing came in 1999, when he returned to Hensley to drive their No. 63 Chevrolet in the NASCAR Busch Series. Despite achieving a seventh-place finish at Charlotte, his performance did not meet the team's expectations. Bown was released from Hensley halfway into the season, and he ultimately decided to retire from racing. Throughout his final years, Chuck Bown navigated a myriad of challenges that characterized the end of his racing career, including multiple team changes and releases. However, he left behind a legacy as a tenacious and talented driver, given his impressive racing record in NASCAR.

A man jumps onto a balance beam. they","completion":"In this scenario, a man jumps onto a balance beam. Most naturally, the following events would occur: 1. Regaining Stability: Immediately after jumping onto the balance beam, the man will need to regain his stability. This will require him to engage his core muscles, maintain a straight posture, and evenly distribute his weight over his feet. He might use his arms to help regain balance, extending them out from his sides. 2. Adjusting Foot Placement: Once stable, the man will begin carefully adjusting his foot placement as he prepares to move forward or perform various exercises on the balance beam. This may involve shifting his feet to be in line with each other or placing one foot in front of the other. He must maintain focus and concentration to prevent any missteps. 3. Walking, Hopping, or Performing Acrobatics: Depending on the man's level of skill and the specific exercises he wishes to perform, he may begin moving along the balance beam in various ways. This could include walking slowly and deliberately, hopping from one foot to the other, or even incorporating acrobatic moves such as cartwheels, handstands, or flips. 4. Focusing on Technique and Form: As the man navigates the balance beam, he will need to pay close attention to his technique and form. This is crucial for maintaining his balance and ensuring a safe and successful training session or performance. Proper form generally involves straight posture, controlled movements, and keeping the body's center of gravity aligned with the beam. 5. Building Confidence and Endurance: Over time and with consistent practice, the man will begin to develop increased confidence and endurance on the balance beam. As he masters basic techniques, he can gradually progress to more advanced exercises and combinations. This ongoing improvement will help him maintain an interest in the activity and continue progressing. 6. Completing the Routine or Exercise: Once the man has successfully executed his desired moves or routine on the balance beam, he will carefully dismount the beam. This can be done by simply stepping off, completing a controlled jump, or executing a more advanced dismount such as a flip or aerial maneuver. 7. Practicing and Refining Skills: After completing his routine or exercise on the balance beam, the man will likely reflect on his performance and identify areas for improvement. He may continue to practice specific exercises or combinations to further develop his skills and master more advanced moves. Additionally, he may seek feedback from a coach, instructor, or training partner to help improve technique and form. In summary, after a man jumps onto a balance beam, what most naturally follows is regaining stability, adjusting foot placement, walking or performing acrobatics, focusing on technique and form, building confidence and endurance, and practicing and refining skills on the beam. These steps help create a safe and successful experience for the individual in a fascinating and physically demanding activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose only known architectural subject is a drawing of the interior of the Old Church , can you please find it? During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon.

It does feature in his only... A:","completion":"The answer to your question is Jacob van Ruisdael. He's the one whose only known architectural subject is a drawing of the interior of the Old Church. Ruisdael was a prominent Dutch painter during the Golden Age. Throughout his career, he had been known for his wide range of subjects, and his ability to beautifully illustrate them. Ruisdael’s work throughout his career primarily revolved around landscapes. He worked with all sorts of landscapes, except for Italianate landscapes and foreign landscapes that were not Scandinavian. A theme he favored was the portrayal of forests, rivers, dunes, country roads, panoramas, imaginary views, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Ruisdael’s imaginary landscapes were said to reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. This indicates Ruisdael's deep understanding and appreciation of the aesthetics and principles of landscape gardening, leading him to produce works of art that represented this beauty and complexity. Windmills were often featured throughout Ruisdael's career. One of his most famous works is \\"Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede,\\" which shows the convergence of typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water, and expansive sky on a dominant cylindrical windmill. His portrayal of windmills throughout his career highlights his ability to depict the elements that characterize the Netherlands. Ruisdael also created many panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds, a genre known as \\"Haerlempjes,\\" with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. One recurring feature in these paintings is Saint Bavo's Church, where Ruisdael was eventually buried. Despite living in Amsterdam for over 25 years, it rarely featured in his work. To sum up, although Jacob van Ruisdael had a wide repertoire of landscape subjects in his oeuvre, when it came to architectural rendering, he is only known for a drawing of the interior of the Old Church. This element elevates the uniqueness of that art piece in Ruisdael's portfolio."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Q: Species divergence often, but not always, occurs because of what type of barrier between species? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Sympatric Speciation Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland. ” A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied. One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.14). Choices: - emotional - visible - language - physical A: Answer:","completion":"Physical barriers are often, but not always, the cause of species divergence. Based on the provided paragraph, it explains that species divergence can also occur due to sympatric speciation, where species diverge within the same habitat without the presence of physical barriers. Sympatric speciation can be initiated by mechanisms like chromosomal errors during cell division, leading to conditions such as aneuploidy. Thus, the correct answer is physical barriers, although it is important to note that species divergence can occur without them as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The incident in question occurred when he dismissed Australian batsman Matthew Hayden with a leg before wicket (lbw) ruling. Akhtar gestured for Hayden to head to the dressing room, which was considered unsportsmanlike and against the spirit of the game. This behavior led to a charge of level one misconduct being brought against him. Cricket, as a sport, not only emphasizes performance on the field but also values sportsmanship and respect between players, regardless of the intensity of the competition. Level one misconduct is the most lenient of penalties given to cricketers for breaching game conduct. It can include minor offenses like showing dissent towards the umpire or using language deemed offensive. Nevertheless, the charge stands as a reminder for players to maintain a certain level of decorum while participating in the sport. This incident took place during a Test match, considered the most traditional form of cricket. Test matches span up to five days, with each team getting two innings. The longer duration allows the game to develop in terms of strategies and tactics on both sides. It, therefore, demands a high level of patience and focus from the players. As a result, maintaining proper conduct becomes an essential part of the game. Shoaib Akhtar is a notable figure in the cricketing world, known for his aggression and fast-paced bowling. Besides his skill and prowess, Akhtar was also known for controversies involving behavior and disputes. Throughout his career, he faced various misconduct-related charges and bans. Despite such incidents, cricket as a sport continues to draw large audiences and fans from around the world. It provides a platform that enables countries to showcase their talents and compete healthily. Ensuring that players maintain a proper conduct enables the game to progress positively and enhances the spirit of sportsmanship. In conclusion, this event occurred within the realm of sports, specifically cricket, as it involved two international teams - Pakistan and Australia. The charging of Shoaib Akhtar with level one misconduct is a reminder that adherence to proper conduct is important in the world of cricket. It ensures the spirit of the game remains intact, and players on and off the field continue to foster a culture of mutual respect, competitive spirit, and fair play."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During her youth, she suffered from numerous health problems including chronic asthma, which also plagued her at a later age. Because his daughter was so frail and sickly, Charles Lenglen, the owner of a carriage company, decided that it would be good for her to compete in tennis and gain strength. Her first try at the game was in 1910, when she played on the tennis court at the family property in Marest-sur-Matz. The first major female tennis star to turn professional, Lenglen was paid US50,000 by American entrepreneur Charles C. Pyle to tour the United States in a series of matches against Mary K. Browne. Browne, winner of the US Championships from 1912 to 1914, was 35 and considered to be past her prime, although she had reached the French final earlier that year (losing to Lenglen 6-1, 6-0). For the first time in tennis history, the women's match was the headline event of the tour (which also featured male players). In their first match in New York City, Lenglen put on a performance that New York Times writer Allison Danzig lauded as \\"one of the most masterly exhibitions of court generalship that has been seen in this country.\\" When the tour ended in February 1927, Lenglen had defeated Browne, 38 matches to 0. She was exhausted from the lengthy tour, and a physician advised Lenglen that she needed a lengthy period away from the game to recover. Instead, Lenglen chose to retire from competitive tennis to run a Paris tennis school, which she set up with the help and money of her lover Jean Tillier. The school, located next to the courts of Roland Garros, slowly expanded and was recognised as a federal training centre by the French tennis federation in 1936. During this period, Lenglen also wrote several books on tennis. Lenglen was criticised widely for her decision to turn professional, and the All England Club at Wimbledon even revoked her honorary membership. Lenglen, however, described her decision as \\"an escape from bondage and slavery\\" and said in the tour programme, \\"In the twelve years I have been champion I have earned literally millions of francs for tennis and have paid thousands of francs in entrance fees to be allowed to do so.... I have worked as hard at my career as any man or woman has worked at any career. And in my whole lifetime I have not earned 5,000 - not one cent of that by my specialty, my life study - tennis.... I am twenty-seven and not wealthy - should I embark on any other career and leave the one for which I have what people call genius? Or should I smile at the prospect of actual poverty and continue to earn a fortune - for whom?\\" As for the amateur tennis system, Lenglen said, \\"Under these absurd and antiquated amateur rulings, only a wealthy person can compete, and the fact of the matter is that only wealthy people do compete. Is that fair? Does it advance the sport? Does it make tennis more popular - or does it tend to suppress and hinder an enormous amount of tennis talent lying dormant in the bodies of young men and women whose names are not in the social register?\\"","completion":"This text is about Suzanne Lenglen, a French tennis player who became the first major female tennis star to turn professional.

Is \\"European model sports clubs were formed with the spreading popularity of football matches in 19th century Constantinople.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, your statement is generally correct. European model sports clubs began to form in the Ottoman Empire during the late 19th century, primarily centered around Constantinople (present-day Istanbul). With the increasing influence of Europe during this period, traditional Ottoman sports began to coexist with modern, imported sports like football (soccer). Here, I will provide a more detailed account of the development of European sport clubs in the Ottoman Empire. The introduction of European sports into the Ottoman Empire can be traced back to the second half of the 19th century when contact between the Ottoman Empire and Europe increased due to trade, diplomacy, and international events. These exchanges brought new ideas, practices, and ways of life, including sports and physical education. European sports clubs first emerged in the Ottoman Empire among the non-Muslim and foreign communities that resided in the empire, particularly in cosmopolitan cities such as Constantinople. These early clubs were formed about the same time as their counterparts in Europe, albeit on a much smaller scale. Initially, these clubs mainly served the expatriate and minority communities in the empire, but they quickly grew and began to attract the attention of the larger Ottoman population. The spreading popularity of football (soccer) matches played a vital role in the establishment of European sport clubs in the Ottoman Empire. The first football match ever recorded in the Ottoman Empire took place in 1895 between Cadi-Keuy Rugby Club and a team of British sailors. Inspired by these matches, Ottoman societies quickly began to form their own football teams, and the sport quickly gained popularity. Many of the first football clubs in the Ottoman Empire were founded by the non-Muslim minorities, such as Greeks, Armenians, and Levantines. Notable clubs founded at this time included the Imogene Football Club established in 1904, the Greek Pera Club founded in 1901, and the Armenian Mektebi Football Club established in 1899. Over time, Turks themselves began to actively participate in European sports and formed their own clubs. One of the first Turkish football clubs, the Black Stockings, was founded in 1910. The rapid rise in popularity of football in the Ottoman Empire led to the formation of a football league in Constantinople in 1904. Known as the Istanbul Football League, this was one of the first football leagues outside of the British Isles and featured teams from various backgrounds and ethnicities, reflecting the diversity of the Ottoman Empire. In conclusion, European model sports clubs, particularly those dedicated to football, began to form in the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century. The spreading popularity of football matches in Constantinople, as well as the increasing influence of Europe during this period, played a significant role in the establishment of these clubs, which initially catered to foreign and non-Muslim communities in the empire. By the early 20th century, however, these clubs had gained widespread popularity and began to attract the larger Ottoman population, leading to the formation of football leagues and the further entrenchment of European sports in the Ottoman Empire."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Where is a very bad place to find a crab?

A group of four boys walk up to Bleek Gilliam's brownstone and ask him to come out and play baseball with them. Bleek's mother insists that he continue his trumpet lesson, to his chagrin. His father becomes concerned that Bleek will grow up to be a sissy, and a family argument ensues. In the end, Bleek continues playing his trumpet, and his friends go away. The next scene brings us to the present (over twenty years later), with an adult Bleek (Denzel Washington) performing on the trumpet at a busy nightclub with his jazz band, The Bleek Quintet (Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts, Wesley Snipes, Giancarlo Esposito and Bill Nunn). Giant (Spike Lee, one of his boyhood friends from the previous scene and current manager of Bleek's band), is waiting in the wings, and advises him to stop allowing his saxophone player Shadow Henderson (Snipes) to grandstand with long solos. The next morning Bleek wakes up with his girlfriend, Indigo Downes (Joie Lee). She leaves to go to class, while he meets his father by the Brooklyn Bridge for a game of catch, telling him that while he does like Indigo, he likes other women too and is not ready to make a commitment. Later in the day while he is practicing his trumpet, another woman named Clarke Bentancourt (Cynda Williams) visits him. She suggests he fire Giant as his manager; he suggests that they make love (which he refers to as \\"moâ better\\"). She bites his lip and he becomes upset about it, saying, \\"I make my living with my lips\\", as he examines the bleeding bottom lip. Giant is with his bookie, betting on baseball. Then he goes to the nightclub and argues with the doormen about what time to let the patrons into the club. He meets Bleek inside with the rest of the band, except for the pianist, Left Hand Lacey (Esposito), who arrives late with his French girlfriend and is scolded by Giant.

Water density increases as salinity increases: This means that salt water is denser than regular (fresh) water because of the increased concentration of salt (increased salinity). 2. Water density increases as pressure increases: In the context of your question, this fact may not apply directly, unless we consider depths of water bodies where pressure changes are significant. However, for simplicity, we will focus on the salinity and temperature factors. 3. Water density increases as temperature decreases: This implies that colder water is denser than warmer water. However, in your case, no specific temperature variation is indicated between the regular and salt water. Given this information, and without considering significant temperature differences between the two types of water, the salt water would sink because it is denser than the regular water due to its higher salinity. And here is the elaborated thinking process: Step 1: Confirm that the only difference between the two types of water in this scenario is the presence of salt. Step 2: Recall from the provided facts that the presence of salt increases water density (water density increases as salinity increases). Step 3: Understand that an object (or a fluid) will sink in another if it is denser than the other fluid.

Input: A team of 20 doctors, including surgeons, neurosurgeons, anesthesiologists and nurses, will be deployed to the region of Marche in central Italy for two weeks, Italian ambassador to Ukraine, Davide La Cecilia told Reuters. “The national health service in our country is very stressed. So we badly need medical personnel and are very happy that Ukraine is sending this humanitarian aid,” said La Cecilia at Kiev’s airport, before the medical mission’s departure. Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, who accompanied the ambassador, said Kiev would send more medical aid and disinfectant to Italy in the coming days. “It is an honour for us to help Italy during such tough times. We know that many Ukrainians live and work in Italy. By helping Italy, we are helping our citizens,” said Avakov. Ukraine’s health ministry has reported 1,096 cases, including 28 deaths since March 3, when the first case was recorded. But as thousands of Ukrainians have recently returned home from abroad, the ministry expects a much bigger outbreak ahead. The daily tally of new cases increased to 154 on Saturday from 138 on Friday, up from 62 last Monday. The head of the Ukrainian medical mission, neurosurgeon Andriy Miroshnichenko, said that all the team members volunteered to work in Italy. “After they come back home, they will be able to treat patients and work having practical experience and knowledge about the disease,” said Miroshnichenko.

Background: Thomas Michael Cousineau (born May 6, 1957) is an American former college and professional football player who was a linebacker in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons during the 1970s and 1980s. He played college football for Ohio State University, and twice earned All-American honors. He was the first overall pick of the 1979 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the CFL's Montreal Alouettes and the NFL's Cleveland Browns and San Francisco 49ers. Cousineau is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, elected in the class of 2016. Context: Cousineau attended Ohio State University, where he played for legendary coach Woody Hayes' Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1975 to 1978. During that span, Ohio State had an overall record of 36-10-2 and 28-4 in the Big Ten, were three-time Big Ten champs. The Buckeyes played four bowl games after each of the seasons he played: in the Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl and Gator Bowl. They were a Top 5 team for 36 weeks over these four years and the No. 1 team in the nation for eight weeks in 1975, and ultimately finished fourth, sixth and 12th in the final Associated Press polls in 1975, 1976 and 1977, respectively. Cousineau majored in marketing. It is rumored that he frequently ate Ken Boock's lunch while attending Ohio State. He was a consensus first-team All-American, breaking the school record with 211 tackles in a single season in 1978, an average of 17.5 a game. He also broke the school record for most tackles in a game with 29 against Penn State in 1978, and was the MVP of the 1977 Orange Bowl. Cousineau's last game for the Buckeyes was the infamous 1978 Gator Bowl against Clemson, during which Coach Hayes punched Clemson linebacker Charlie Bauman in the final minutes of the game. Hayes was fired the following day for the incident. Cousineau still holds many of Ohio State's tackling records. As of 2016, he holds six of the top 10 single-game tackling records, 29 single-game tackles (since tied by fellow College Football Hall of Famer Chris Spielman), most solo tackles in a single game, (16 against SMU in 1978). He also ranks second on both the all-time OSU tackle list with 569 (three behind Marcus Marek) and on the career solo tackles list with 259. He was named an All-American in 1977 and 1978. The Chicago Tribune named him the MVP of the Big Ten in 1978. He graduated from OSU in 1979. In 2016, he became the 25th Ohio State player, along with seven Buckeye coaches, to be named to the College Football Hall of Fame. Question: What was the school record? Answer:","completion":"The school record that Thomas Michael Cousineau set was for the most tackles in a single season. In 1978, he made 211 tackles, which was the highest number of tackles made by a player at Ohio State University at that time. This means he was really good at stopping the other team's players during the games."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"where did fred west work?\\" Answer:","completion":"Fred West was a notorious British serial killer who, along with his wife Rosemary West, was convicted of murdering several young women between the 1960s and 1980s. Despite his criminal activity, Fred West held various jobs throughout his lifetime, which primarily centered on labor and construction work. One of the places where Fred West worked was as an ice cream van driver in Gloucester, England. He started this job in the mid-1960s after meeting his first wife, Catherine \\"Rena\\" Costello. Selling ice cream allowed him to have regular contact with young people and children in the local community. This job played a significant role in enabling his predatory behavior, as it put him in close proximity to potential victims. In addition to working as an ice cream van driver, Fred West was often employed in the construction industry as a builder, laborer, and handyman. He worked on numerous construction sites and projects in and around the Gloucester area, including laying roads, building houses, and performing maintenance work. Notably, his skills in building and construction became a horrifying factor in his crimes, as he frequently used these abilities to hide the remains of his victims by burying them beneath concrete or dismembering their bodies in order to dispose of them more easily. Although Fred West held multiple jobs during his lifetime, it is crucial to remember that his employment does not define him; he will forever be remembered as a brutal, sadistic serial killer who committed horrendous crimes against innocent young women. In conclusion, Fred West's work history included working as an ice cream van driver and being employed in various construction-related jobs in the Gloucester area. These occupations not only provided him with an income but also allowed him to interact with potential victims and use his construction skills to hide his nefarious activities.

Answer the following question: Background: The frequency of sound waves is measured in hertz (Hz), or the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a second. Human beings can normally hear sounds with a frequency between about 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Sounds with frequencies below 20 hertz are called infrasound . Sounds with frequencies above 20,000 hertz are called ultrasound . Some other animals can hear sounds in the ultrasound range. For example, dogs can hear sounds with frequencies as high as 50,000 Hz. You may have seen special whistles that dogs but not people can hear. The whistles produce a sound with a frequency too high for the human ear to detect. Other animals can hear even higher-frequency sounds. Bats, for example, can hear sounds with frequencies higher than 100,000 Hz. Paragraph: David wants to categorize animals according to the sound waves they can hear. Eventually, he was able to categorize them in three different groups, group A, group B, and group C. He placed the animals that can only hear ifrasound in group A. Then he placed the animals that are only able to hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do in group B. The last group of animals were able to hear only ultrasound. He placed them in group C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group would be able to hear higher frequency, group A or group B? Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, group B would be able to hear higher frequency sound waves compared to group A. This is because group A consists of animals that can only hear infrasound, which has frequencies below 20 hertz, whereas group B comprises animals that can hear the same frequency of sound waves as humans do, which is within a range of approximately 20 to 20,000 hertz. The audible frequency range for humans is generally significantly higher than the infrasound range.

Similarly, forcing more randomly moving molecules into the same amount of space will cause an increased number of collisions over a given length of time, providing the reactants with more opportunities to transform into products. Now, I have a new situation: John is a chemical engineer with a pharmaceutical company. He is trying to develop a drug that can be absorbed by the system in different rates. To that end, he conducted two experiments. In one case, he used lower concentrations of reactants, he called it case A. Then he used the same reactants in a higher concentration. He called it case B. Answer this question please: Would case A have higher or lower rate of reactions than case B? Answer:","completion":"Case A would have a lower rate of reactions than case B. Since case A uses lower concentrations of reactants, there will be fewer collisions between molecules in comparison to case B, where higher concentrations of reactants lead to more frequent collisions and hence, a higher rate of reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Exile: There is growing evidence that several cardinals do not want Benedict XVI to live in an apartment block inside the walls of the Vatican The Pope is under pressure to go into exile from Rome after he retires so that he does not interfere with the work of his successor, senior Roman Catholic sources indicated yesterday. There is growing evidence that several cardinals are anxious that Benedict XVI should not carry through his plan to live in an apartment block inside the walls of the Vatican. They fear the close presence of a retired Pope will create difficulties for the new man who will take over the Papacy this spring. The suggestion that Benedict should be effectively evicted from his planned retreat and dismissed from Rome came just two days after the","completion":"82-year-old Pontiff shocked the world by announcing his intention to retire on February 28 due to his declining health and diminishing strength. This decision marks the first time in nearly 600 years that a Pope has chosen to step down from his position voluntarily. The concern among several cardinals is that Benedict's continued presence in Rome and close proximity to the new Pope may cast a shadow over his successor's authority, potentially leading to divisions within the Church and affecting its ability to deal with the numerous challenges it currently faces, including the ongoing clergy sexual abuse scandals, financial mismanagement, and the struggle to maintain a united global community of believers. To avoid potential conflicts and to ensure a smooth transition, some high-ranking church officials are proposing alternative locations for Benedict to reside post-retirement. Possible locations include monasteries or other religious institutions in Italy or even his native Germany. A remote retreat in a different country could also provide the former Pope with much-needed privacy and an opportunity to dedicate the remainder of his life to prayer and reflection, as he has indicated as his intention. Of course, the final decision about where Benedict XVI will reside after his resignation will likely depend on multiple factors, including his health, personal preferences, and input from the new Pope and other key decision-makers within the Catholic Church. The Vatican is expected to address these concerns and to provide more information about the proposed arrangements for the retired Pope in the coming weeks. It is important to note that regardless of where Benedict XVI ultimately decides to live in his retirement, the Catholic Church will need to make a collective effort to support his successor and to honor the unique circumstances that have led to this historic change in leadership. By demonstrating unity and solidarity, the Church can showcase its commitment to its central mission and prepare for a new chapter in its history. In conclusion, while the most logical way to complete this passage emphasizes concerns surrounding a retired Pope living within the Vatican walls, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context. Ultimately, the Catholic Church should strive for a peaceful transition that respects Benedict XVI's wishes and supports the new Pope in addressing the pressing challenges that the institution faces. Whether this includes an exile from Rome or an alternative arrangement remains to be seen, but the goal should be a united Church that can continue its spiritual mission and effectively address the issues confronting it today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He wore a white cap and drove a white truck. Of course, he delivered more than milk. There was cheese, eggs and so on. If we needed to change our order, my mother would write a note -- \\"Please add a bottle of buttermilk next delivery\\". Then she put the note and the empty bottles into the milk box. The next day, the buttermilk would magically appear. There was also a close relationship between families and their milkmen. Mr. Basille even had a key to our house, for those times when it was so cold outside that we put the box in the house, so that the milk wouldn't freeze.

Given the question: - The magma cools - Particles inside the magma move closer together - Crystals are formed - The crystals contain minerals. What might be the first step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The first step of the process, leading to the formation of crystals containing minerals, is the intrusion of magma deep within Earth's crust. To provide a better understanding of this process, let us delve deeper into each of the subsequent steps that occur from the initial formation of magma to the development of crystals with minerals. 1. Formation of Magma: Magma is formed as a result of partial melting of the Earth's mantle or crust due to certain geological processes, such as tectonic plate movement and subduction. This molten rock material consists of various elements, minerals, and volatile substances, such as water and carbon dioxide. The temperatures at which magma is formed can vary between 700 to 1300°C (1300 to 2400°F) depending on the specific composition and geological setting. 2. Intrusion of Magma: Magma intrusions typically occur within the Earth's crust, although they can sometimes reach the surface through volcanic eruptions. The magma may accumulate in chambers called magma reservoirs, situated several kilometers underneath the Earth's surface. Magma movement within Earth's crust is influenced by factors such as buoyancy, pressure, and the melting of surrounding rocks. The intrusion process can be slow, taking thousands to millions of years, and may lead to the eventual cooling and solidification of the magma. 3. Cooling of Magma: As the magma intrudes into the crust, it starts to cool down and lose its heat to the surrounding rocks. The rate of cooling depends on various factors, including the size and depth of the magma intrusion and the temperature of the surrounding rocks. Slow cooling generally occurs at deeper levels of the crust and facilitates the growth of larger crystals, while rapid cooling on or near the Earth's surface results in the formation of smaller crystals or volcanic glass. 4. Crystallization of Minerals: During the cooling process, the particles of elements and minerals within the magma move closer together and bond with each other to form crystals. The crystallization process is governed by a specific sequence called Bowen's Reaction Series, which defines the order in which minerals crystallize based on their temperatures and chemical compositions. Crystallization typically starts with the formation of minerals containing high-temperature elements like olivine, pyroxene, and calcium-rich plagioclase, followed by the creation of minerals containing lower-temperature elements, such as biotite, amphibole, and potassium-rich feldspar. 5. Formation of Igneous Rocks: Once the magma has fully cooled down and solidified, the resulting mass of interlocking crystals and minerals forms an igneous rock. Based on the size and distribution of the mineral crystals, igneous rocks are classified as either intrusive (plutonic) or extrusive (volcanic). Intrusive rocks, such as granite and gabbro, have large, well-formed crystals due to slow cooling processes, while extrusive rocks, like basalt and rhyolite, have smaller crystals or a glassy appearance due to rapid cooling on or near the Earth's surface. In conclusion, the first step in the process that leads to the formation of crystals containing minerals within magma is the formation and intrusion of magma within the Earth's crust. This sets off a sequence of events, including cooling and crystallization, that ultimately result in the development of various igneous rocks. These rocks provide a glimpse into the dynamic processes taking place deep within our planet and contribute significantly to the continuous evolution of Earth's crust and surface."},{"prompt":"Question: The Fred Krause House on W.

Гран-при Великобритании 1953 года Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The phrase \\"Гран-при Великобритании 1953 года\\" translates into English as \\"The 1953 British Grand Prix\\". The British Grand Prix is a race in the calendar of the FIA Formula One World Championship. It is currently held at the Silverstone Circuit near the village of Silverstone in Northamptonshire in England. The 1953 British Grand Prix, in particular, was the 6th round of the 1953 Formula One season, and was held on July 18th. During the race, the reigning Champion Alberto Ascari led for most of the event. However, due to a slow pit-stop and a persistent misfire to his Ferrari, he was narrowly beaten by the Maserati of Fangio. The Argentine ace was able to push hard and took his first victory of the season. This race was significant in several ways. Firstly, it was the first British Grand Prix held after the adoption of the World Driver's Championship in 1950. Secondly, it was the first race that could have crowned a World Champion as it was the penultimate round of that year's Championship, and both Ascari and Fangio were contenders. Furthermore, this was the first race in which the Ferrari’s and Maserati’s new, larger, 2.5 L engines were allowed to compete against each other. The performance advantages of the new engines were immediately apparent, as the pole time of this event set by Ascari was a massive 2 seconds quicker than the previous record. The race also saw English drivers compete in their home Grand Prix. Mike Hawthorn, who would later become the first British driver to win a World Championship in 1958, made a big impression in his second season with Ferrari. He ended up finishing in fourth place, though he would have been third but for a spin during the race. Lastly, the 1953 British Grand Prix was notable for its competitive nature. The lead changed hands multiple times, and there were intense battles for position throughout the field. Such a level of competition was rarely seen in Grand Prix races at that time. All in all, the 1953 British Grand Prix isn't just a race, but a special event in the motorsport history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The only remotely amusing thing about the Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco, the best actor in this movie. Also, it is rated NC-17, shunning away the only people that might tolerate it. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as overwhelmingly negative and highly critical. The reviewer seems extremely disappointed, dissatisfied, and even offended by the content of the movie in question. They emphasize their distaste for the movie by stating that \\"words cannot describe how utterly abysmal\\" it is, which implies that the reviewer's negative feelings toward the film are incredibly strong. The reviewer goes on to provide examples of some of the movie's elements that they found repulsive, such as the \\"random, unfunny clips,\\" the \\"stupid Batman spoof,\\" and the \\"disturbing\\" scene involving a character engaging in inappropriate behavior with an old dead lady. These specific examples reinforce the reviewer's overall condemnation of the movie. Moreover, the reviewer offers a backhanded compliment to Joey Buttafuoco as the best actor in the film, suggesting that the rest of the cast performed even worse than him. This further emphasizes the review's overwhelmingly negative sentiment. Lastly, the reviewer points out the NC-17 rating of the film, implying that this rating actually alienates the only audience that might have potentially enjoyed the movie. This observation is an indirect jibe at the filmmakers, suggesting that their choice of content and rating was counterintuitive and ultimately detrimental to the movie.

Talk things over with a family member, friend, counselor or minister. There are times when something is so personal that it can be hard to open up to those who know us. You may consider making an appointment with a counselor or clergy member. Feelings have a way of jumbling up, making them difficult to articulate. An objective third party individual can help by asking you the right questions to untangle your emotions without inserting their own opinions. The important part here is to simply start talking, rather than getting stuck in your own head where there is no one to help validate or correct your thoughts. Write a letter to your loved one. Then, let it go to signify your own mental choice to let him go. Some people find it cathartic to burn their letter, signifying a definitive end. Or you may prefer something more considerate of the place this person will always hold in your heart. This may be more appropriate if you are letting go because this person has passed. You might prefer placing your message in a helium filled balloon and setting it free. Another option is creating a sky lantern with words of love written on it and sending it off as though mailing your loved one. You may also choose to journal your feelings. Give space to the feelings you feel now, as well as the ones you hope to restore. Journaling allows you to be completely honest with yourself because your words are for your eyes only. This practice also helps you to identify patterns in your thinking, your actions and behavior. Changing even the slightest thing in your life can help you feel refreshed and remind you that life is still fun. Rearrange your furniture. Try a new haircut. Drive a different way to work. Eat dessert first. Whatever you choose to change, no matter how small, pick something enjoyable. It may only be a temporary mood lifter, but that may be all you need to remind yourself that you can still smile and enjoy life.

As a predominantly Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of Ireland, or at least those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. The English scholar D. D. R. Owen, who specialises in the literature of this era, writes that \\"Professional storytellers would ply their trade from court to court. Some of them would have been native Scots, no doubt offering legends from the ancient Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when appropriate, but in French for most of the new nobility\\". Almost all of these stories are lost, although some have come down in the Gaelic or Scots oral tradition. One form of oral culture extremely well accounted for in this period is genealogy. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the Mormaers of Lennox and Moray to the Scottish king himself. Scotland's kings maintained an ollamh righe, a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations.Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. Dauvit Broun has shown that a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, in places such as Loch Leven and Brechin into the thirteenth century, However, surviving records are predominantly written in Latin, and their authors would usually translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with researching a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, Gilla Brigte became Gilbert, Áed became Hugh, etc. As far as written literature is concerned, there may be more...

To do this, we must determine if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. Step 4: Evaluating the strength of the connection In this case, the premise states that the speaker's defense is completely meaningless. This suggests that any argument they present in court will have no impact on the outcome. However, the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, as there might be other factors at play, such as: 1. The prosecutor could have a weak case or make mistakes. 2. There might be strong evidence in favor of the speaker that doesn't rely on their defense. 3. The jury might be biased towards the speaker for various reasons. 4. The judge might find errors in the legal process, leading to the case being dismissed. Step 5: Conclusion Since there are scenarios in which the premise can be true without guaranteeing the truth of the hypothesis, we can conclude that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis \\"I will lose the case.\\" There might be a correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, but it's not a definitive causal relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize: A good way to make putting your outfit together easier is to pick one item and craft the entire outfit around that item. Usually the specific item is one of the statement pieces, but it doesn't have to be. Example: If you're looking to showcase a big gorgeous necklace, wear a plain, neutral t-shirt with a neck that's cut so that the necklace can be seen. Pair this with jeans and a pair of flats. This way the necklace acts as the most important part of the outfit with nothing to draw attention away from it. You can also work an outfit around a specific color. So for instance, one week you could wear something red each day and make outfits around that color and the next week you could move on to green. For instance you could pair a red skirt with a black blouse, navy tights, black boots and blue jewelry. ' This means find the two or three basic ensembles you like to wear and put together outfits using these as bases, while you mix things up a little. These will be the outfits that you feel most comfortable in. For example, you could find that you tend towards an ensemble of skinny jeans (black and denim), a few different t-shirts (both long and short sleeve) with varying footwear (for instance, you could dress the outfit up with a pair of ankle boots or some flats). If you wear a lot of jeans you could mix things up a bit by rolling up the cuffs (a good spring or summer variation). You could vary between jeans and a sweater and skirts and a sweater. This would give you more range. The color and type of sweater could change and you could vary it with different jewelry, scarves and shoes, but the basic outfit would either be jeans and sweater or skirt and sweater. Mixing and matching clothing is your basis for choosing different outfits each day. This way you don't have to wear the same t-shirt and jeans routine that you always do (although that's perfectly okay if that's what you like). Using a black blazer as an example: you could put the blazer with jeans, a white t-shirt, a bright blouse and flats. You could pair the blazer with a pale spring skirt, ankle boots and chunky jewelry. Or you could put the blazer over a long, colorful summer dress and wear sandals. With only 8 different pieces of clothing you can make a variety of outfits. Pick a solid colored and a print t-shirt, a pair of jeans, a skirt, a dress, a cardigan, a blouse, and a vest. You could wear the print t-shirt with the jeans and the vest and a pair of sandals. You could wear the dress, the cardigan and a skinny belt, or the dress, the vest and a pair of boots. You could pair the skirt with each of the tops in turn and wear either the vest or the cardigan over them. Pair with jewelry, a scarf, and a shoes. You can change your wardrobe around as the seasons change (if you live in a place where that happens). Save the warmer scarves and sweaters for fall and winter along with your warmer jackets. Have boots work as your cool weather footwear, while flats and sandals can be your warmer weather go-tos. Colors, too, can change depending on the season. In warmer parts of the wear you could wear paler colors to keep you cooler and more floral prints to reflect the flowers. In winter it's fun to wear some brighter colors especially if you live in a dark or rainy place, so that your bright gold scarf or red dress brings a flare of color to an otherwise drably colored day. As you try out outfits, mixing and matching and determining what your base style is, take pictures, or write down a description, of each outfit. This way you can remember what worked and what didn't, so that you either recreate the outfit, or you can remember that that particular outfit didn't work. This can also help you decide what to wear if you're feeling unsure. Just go back through your outfit photos and pick the one you liked the best. You'll feel confident because you know it looks good and your decision will have been made. Look everywhere for outfit ideas. Look at mannequins in store windows, look a catalogs and fashion magazines, look at what people are wearing as you're out and about. These will give you ideas for what you can try out. You don't have to go out and buy all new things based on an outfit you saw in a magazine or on the street. Instead, go through your wardrobe and see what clothing you already own that you can use to recreate the look. This way you won't be copying exactly, you'll be putting your own style onto it. This is the most important part of putting together outfits and especially in getting good at it. You have to try out different styles and clothes and outfits before you find the ones that you really like. Only re-wear the outfits that you liked and that you felt comfortable and confident in. Comfort and confidence are the keys to looking good.","completion":"To make putting your outfit together easier, choose one item or color to build the entire outfit around.

By 1945, and after a string of solid WWII propaganda pieces, Errol Flynn’s hold over U.S. box office had started to decline so, in spite of the increased burden of waning looks, he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name: the swashbuckler. The first of these was a good one actually – ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN (1948) – but it also proved to be his last big-budget Hollywood starring vehicle. The rest of his sword-wielding days were spent wandering all over Europe: in England for KIM (1950), THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE (1953) and THE DARK AVENGER (1955), in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN (1951) and Italy for the aborted THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL (1953) and the little-seen CROSSED SWORDS (1954). However, Hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways – albeit for a modestly-budgeted Universal picture rather than a Warner Brothers ‘A’ production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak… Still, the glorious Technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and, while an older and flabbier Flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self, his red-headed leading lady Maureen O’Hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady. Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his larger-than-life starring vehicles, so here he is typically seen as the baddie – the pirate captain Roc Brasiliano, a role he attacks with gusto. Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH (1954) – a viewing of which preceded this one – AGAINST ALL FLAGS takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant TV viewing when vintage Hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring Italian channels. For all I know, this might well have been the very first pirate movie I’ve ever seen and I cringe at the thought of today’s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy is what buccaneering is all about! As I said earlier, AGAINST ALL FLAGS might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it’s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same. Nowadays, the amorous persistence of the child-like Indian princess (Alice Kelley) towards her pirate captor Flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it – despite clearly not scaling the heights of THE SEA HAWK (1940) and THE BLACK SWAN (1942), to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars – is briskly paced and reasonably engaging. Incidentally, the film would later go on to be remade as THE KING’S PIRATE (1967) with Doug McClure! For what it’s worth, the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on DVD and, as a matter of fact, AGAINST ALL FLAGS itself was the one gem in a poorly-thought out “Pirates Of The Golden Age Movie Collection” set from Universal which also consisted of obscure dross like BUCCANEER’S GIRL (1950; with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951; with Donald O’Connor) and YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952; with Jeff Chandler)! Value for money, perhaps but, so far, I have only acquired the Errol Flynn flick from other sources; even so, if the mood strikes me in future, I might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like Edward Dmytyk’s MUTINY (1952), the afore-mentioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA (1961).

In the first quarter, Houston took the early lead with RB Ron Dayne getting a 1-yard TD run. However, the Dolphin answered with kicker Jay Feely getting a 23-yard field goal, along with RB Ronnie Brown getting a 3-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Texans' recent struggles continued as Miami managed to get 40-yard and a 33-yard field goal from Feely. The Texans would end the half with kicker Kris Brown getting a 54-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Houston began to retaliate with Brown nailing a 43-yard and a 54-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins managed to get a 48-yard field goal.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]\\", answer the following question.

Please answer this question: Which company made the first pocket sized transistor radio","completion":"The first pocket-sized transistor radio was made by a Tokyo-based Japanese company called Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, now famously known as Sony Corporation. The device, the TR-63, was developed and released in 1957. Following the invention of the transistor in 1947 by Bell Laboratories, several companies began to explore ways to leverage transistor technology for commercial applications. Transistors were revolutionary since they served as an alternative to older vacuum tubes, which were large, fragile, and power-consuming. Transistors, on the other hand, were smaller, more durable, and energy-efficient. In the early 1950s, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo entered the race to create a new compact radio that would utilize transistor technology. The company's co-founders, Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita, envisioned the potential for portable entertainment devices, such as transistor radios, to revolutionize communication. To realize this vision, they collaborated with American companies Bell Laboratories, Western Electric, and Regency Electronics, which were all involved in transistor manufacturing and research. Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo licensed the transistor technology and produced the TR-55, their first transistor radio, in August 1955. However, the radio was not small enough to be pocket-sized, even though it was considerably more compact than previous models. Two years later, the company introduced the TR-63 model. It was smaller in size, measuring just 4.5 x 3 x 1.5 inches, making it the first pocket-sized transistor radio. To achieve this size, engineers redesigned the radio's circuitry and used novel approaches in manufacturing components. The device became a massive success in Japan and later in the United States. The innovation brought by the TR-63 had a substantial impact on the transistor radio market, starting a trend for compact, portable radios. Furthermore, it greatly expanded the company's global reputation, eventually leading to it being renamed Sony Corporation in 1958. In conclusion, the credit for the first pocket-sized transistor radio goes to Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, now known as Sony Corporation. Their pioneering work on the TR-63 model in 1957 led to the popularization of portable transistor radios and played a pivotal role in shaping the portable electronics industry we enjoy today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The increase is attributed to the support provided by the decline in oil prices. However, Johnson & Johnson's stock performance, which caused the Dow to be dragged, is also mentioned in the report. The source of concern is the possible 24 billion takeover of Guidant Corp, a cardiovascular device maker. The news highlights how market and stock movements are influenced by such events, such as mergers and acquisitions, in addition to the broader changes in the market landscape, such as changes in oil prices. Mergers and acquisitions can have a significant impact on the stocks of companies involved in the transaction, and in this case, there are concerns about Johnson & Johnson's role in a potential takeover of Guidant Corp, which has seemingly pulled down their stock and weighed on the Dow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) is a major stock market index that tracks the performance of 30 large publicly-traded companies in the United States. It includes stocks of widely held companies from various industries, and the fluctuation in this index offers a snapshot of the overall U.S. financial market's performance. In this context, the case of Johnson & Johnson and Guidant Corp is noteworthy, as their stock prices' movement affects the index's performance, which in turn impacts investor sentiments and the broader market trends. The reference to lower oil prices in the article also indicates the influence of commodity pricing on the stock market. Oil prices play a crucial role in the global economy due to their far-reaching impact on transportation, energy production, and manufacturing industries. Any changes in oil prices can impact the profits of various companies, ultimately affecting their stock prices. Low oil prices generally benefit companies and industries, as reduced operating costs can translate into higher profits, driving up stock prices and consequently overall market performance. In conclusion, this news article showcases the interconnected nature of the stock market, where individual company events like mergers and acquisitions, and broader market changes like fluctuations in oil prices, can impact market performance and investor sentiments. The case of Johnson & Johnson and Guidant Corp, alongside lower oil prices, offers a glimpse into the ever-evolving market landscape and its constant reaction to numerous factors that drive the stock prices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's sort out what our equation means. We have 8 times a number (let's pretend it's the number of chocolates), then we subtract 16 times the same number (or same number of chocolates). So, it's like saying, you had 8 chocolates, and then you gave away 16 chocolates, and now you owe someone 32 chocolates. This is what -32 implies, you're in debt of 32 chocolates. Here's how it looks: 8*o - 16*o = -32 You can simplify the left-hand side by combining similar terms, because both contain 'o' (the chocolates). So if you have 8 chocolates and you give away 16 chocolates, you'll have '8 - 16 = -8' chocolates left. So it becomes -8*o = -32 Now you want to find out what's the value of 'o', how many chocolates one 'o' represents. The equation becomes o = -32 / -8 The minus divided by minus gives a positive so it becomes o = 32 / 8 When you divide 32 chocolates among 8 people, each person gets 4 chocolates. So, o = 4 So, the answer to the problem is that 'o' equals 4. It means one 'o' represents 4 chocolates!

Input: The populist rhetoric appears to be giving way to a more nuanced strategy focused on making the pharmaceutical market more open and competitive, with the aim of lowering costs for consumers. It’s an approach that could avoid a direct confrontation with the powerful pharmaceutical lobby, but it could also underwhelm Americans seeking relief from escalating prescription costs. On Friday, Trump is scheduled to give his first speech on an overarching plan to lower drug prices. Administration officials previewing the speech Thursday touted it as the most comprehensive plan to tackle prescription drug costs that any president has ever proposed, but offered few specifics. Officials said the plan would increase competition, create incentives for drugmakers to lower initial prices and slash federal rules that make it harder for private insurers to negotiate lower prices. The result would be lower pharmacy costs for patients — a key Trump campaign promise. The plan will not include giving the federal Medicare program power to directly negotiate prices with drugmakers, they noted. Trump campaigned on the idea, which is vigorously opposed by the pharmaceutical industry. Public outrage over drug costs has been growing for years, because Americans are being squeezed in a number of ways: New medicines for cancer and other life-threatening diseases often launch with prices exceeding 100,000 per year. Drugs for common ailments like diabetes and asthma routinely see price hikes around 10 percent annually. Meanwhile some companies have been buying up once-cheap older drugs and hiking prices by 1,000 percent or more. Since entering the White House, Trump has backed away from reforms directly targeting drugmakers and staffed his administration with appointees who have deep ties to the industry, including his health secretary, Alex Azar, a former top executive at Eli Lilly. Still, administration officials ratcheted up the rhetoric ahead of Trump’s speech. Azar promised bold action. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb — another Trump appointee with industry connections — hinted at a plan to “dismantle” the convoluted system of discounts and rebates between drugmakers and health care middlemen. On Thursday, administration officials also vowed to address foreign governments that rely on U.S. medicines but pay drastically lower prices due to government controls. The U.S. accounts for 70 percent of the world’s brand-name drug profits, according to a White House report released earlier this year. Here are some of the drivers of U.S. prescription drug prices, proposals for reducing the costs and what’s at stake: LACK OF REGULATION Drugmakers generally can charge as much as the market will bear because the U.S. government doesn’t regulate medicine prices, unlike most other countries. Medicare is the largest purchaser of prescription drugs in the nation, covering 60 million seniors and Americans with disabilities, but it is barred by law from directly negotiating lower prices with drugmakers. Democrats have long favored giving Medicare that power, but Republicans traditionally oppose the idea. The powerful pharmaceutical lobby has repeatedly fended off proposals that could lower prices, such as Medicare negotiations or importing drugs from countries that regulate pricing. With no direct government price regulation, the primary check on prices comes from buyers in bulk — such as insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, which handle prescription coverage for insurers, employers and other big clients. But because there are so many players in the fragmented system, the discounts achieved in the U.S. are generally far more modest than those in other countries. The result is that the U.S. spends more on medicines than any other nation. In 2015, the U.S. spent 1,162 per person on pharmaceuticals, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That compares with 756 for Canada and 497 for the United Kingdom, both of which have government measures to control drug prices. LACK OF TRANSPARENCY The U.S. system for pricing drugs is notoriously complex, so much that the “real” price for most medicines isn’t clear. Critics contend that this lack of transparency limits competition and drives prices higher. Pharmaceutical companies often launch their drugs with high initial prices. But they argue list prices are merely a starting point for negotiations because they give substantial rebates and discounts to pharmacy benefit managers. Those price concessions are almost never disclosed and it’s unclear what portion actually flows back to consumers. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb and others say the lack of transparency in the current system creates perverse incentives in which drugmakers and other health care companies benefit from rising prices — at the expense of patients. Trump officials have suggested requiring Medicare pharmacy benefit managers to share rebate payments with patients. Another proposal would do away with rebates altogether to encourage more upfront discounts in Medicare. But the benefit managers and insurers say that they use rebates to lower health care premiums overall and that doing away with them would drive up costs. PATENTS AND ANTI-COMPETITIVE TACTICS Patents last longer in the U.S. than most countries, typically giving companies a dozen years of competition-free marketing after a drug launches. Most drugmakers increase their prices annually during this monopoly period, and until recently double-digit price hikes were the norm. Drugmakers also have developed a number of techniques to block competitors from launching lower-cost generic drugs. Companies often tweak drug formulations to extend their patents. In other cases, companies directly pay would-be competitors to stay off the market in so-called “pay-to-delay” deals. Gottlieb has promised a crackdown on some of these techniques used to “game the system.” He’s highlighted a practice in which drugmakers use tightly controlled distribution systems to prevent rival manufacturers from purchasing their drug. This effectively blocks the development of generic versions because generic drugmakers must test their products against the original medicine before they can win FDA approval. PUBLIC PERCEPTION A majority of Americans say bringing down prescription drug prices should be a “top priority” for Trump and Congress, according to recent polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation. And experts who study drug pricing say it’s encouraging that the discussion around the issue has moved from outrage to sophisticated reforms. But some warn there is no guarantee that unraveling the current pricing-setting bureaucracy will lead to lower prices, because it all starts with drugmakers’ prices. “Until we get closer to policy solutions that address the ability of drug manufacturers to set whatever price they want and increase prices year after year we may only be scratching the surface of this problem,” said Juliette Cubanski, a health care expert with the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Dan Mendelson, a health care consultant, said: “If they don’t address the cost that patients see at the pharmacy counter it’s not going to be seen as responsive.” ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education. The AP is solely responsible for all content. Output:","completion":"The Trump administration aims to make the pharmaceutical market more open and competitive by increasing competition, creating incentives for drugmakers to lower initial prices, and slashing federal rules that hinder private insurers from negotiating lower prices, in order to reduce pharmacy costs for patients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Abby Newman is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. The character was introduced on November 13, 2000, as the daughter of Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson) and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). The role was portrayed by Darcy Rose Byrnes as a child until 2008, when the character was rapidly aged to a teenager, with Hayley Erin assuming the role the following year. In 2010, the character was rapidly aged again to an adult, with Marcy Rylan cast as Erin's replacement. Context: In 2010, Abby was romantically linked with Daniel Romalotti. Soon after, she began flirting with Daniel Romalotti when the two begin sharing romantic interactions. Abby had sex with Daniel in the Newman pool house, and she recorded it for her reality show. Abby and Daniel's relationship was outed when Nikki Newman and Daniel's mother, Phyllis Summers, saw Abby and Daniel making out in public. Their relationship continued for a while, but when Abby found out that Daniel fathered a child with Daisy Carter, she broke up with him. Upon Abby's return, Abby was romantically linked to Marco Dapper's Carmine Basco, when the two begin dating much to him being shunned by the town, but Abby is able to convince some of them that Carmine is a good soul. However the relationship wasn't given closure upon Rylan's exit from the soap opera. Dapper admitted in an interview that the writers \\"didn't really know what to do with him after Abby left the first time\\". He also stated that he hoped Carmine would have more of a \\"darker turn\\", and that he still believes there is a \\"left over spark\\" with Abby as their storyline \\"was never finished\\" and \\"nothing was wrapped up properly\\". Shortly after her failed relationship with Carmine, Abby took romantic interest in Detective Ignacio Serricchio's Alex Chavez, and they began dating. However, the relationship was short-lived when the writers soon began developing Abby's relationship with Redaric Williams's Tyler Michaelson. According to Williams, Tyler is \\"intrigued\\" by Abby's unpredictable nature and said that their natural attraction could lead to romance. However, Williams hinted that Tyler's interest in Abby could be his attempt to \\"suppress his feelings\\" for Lily. Abby and Tyler's relationship faced some interference from Tyler's ex-fiancee, Mariah Copeland, but she seemed to back off leading to Tyler proposing to Abby and they became engaged. However, Abby breaks off the engagement when Mariah's interferences causes Abby to believe Tyler is still in love with Mariah. Question: What was her romantic history?

Halve each sprout lengthwise.","completion":"The most logical next event is to prepare and roast the Brussels sprouts. Here's a detailed guide on how to do it: 1. Preheat the oven: Before you start roasting the Brussels sprouts, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). This will ensure that the oven is at the correct temperature, allowing the sprouts to cook evenly. 2. Toss with oil and seasoning: In a large mixing bowl, toss the trimmed and halved Brussels sprouts with olive oil, ensuring that they are evenly coated. The amount of oil used may vary depending on the volume of sprouts you are cooking, but a general rule of thumb is about 2 tablespoons of oil for every pound of Brussels sprouts. Season with salt and pepper, along with any other desired seasonings. Some popular options include garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, or red pepper flakes for an added kick. 3. Add additional flavorings (optional): To enhance the flavor of your Brussels sprouts, consider adding other ingredients such as balsamic vinegar or honey. A drizzle of balsamic vinegar can provide a tangy contrast to the sprouts' natural sweetness, while honey can offer a deliciously caramelized finish. 4. Arrange on a baking sheet: Spread the prepared Brussels sprouts evenly on a large baking sheet, preferably in a single layer for optimal roasting. It's important not to overcrowd the pan, as this could result in uneven cooking and potentially soggy sprouts. 5. Roast the Brussels sprouts: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and roast the sprouts for approximately 20-25 minutes, giving them a good stir or flipping midway through to ensure even browning. The Brussels sprouts should be tender with crisp, golden-brown edges when they're done. 6. Check for doneness and adjust seasoning: Remove the cooked Brussels sprouts from the oven and use a fork to test their tenderness. If they aren't quite done, return them to the oven for another 5-10 minutes. Once they've reached the desired level of doneness, taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add more salt, pepper, or other spices and flavorings as per your preferences. 7. Serve and enjoy: Transfer the roasted Brussels sprouts to a serving platter or bowl and serve immediately. They make a delicious and healthy side dish that pairs well with a variety of proteins, including chicken, fish, beef, or pork. Optional garnishes for roasted Brussels sprouts can include a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan cheese, a squeeze of lemon juice, or a handful of chopped fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro. This dish can also be served with a dipping sauce, such as aioli or a mustard-based sauce, for an added layer of flavor."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem.

There are many products available at your local pet store that can help treat ich. Always follow the instructions labelled on the medication for the correct dosage amounts and if it's safe to use on your type of fish, especially if you have invertebrate fish such as snails, shrimp, and clams. Always perform a water change and vacuum your gravel before you administer the medicine. Medicine is more effective in a clean tank without other dissolved organics or nitrates to get in the way. Always remove the carbon from your filter as the carbon can neutralize or entrap medicines added to the tank. Since saltwater ich lasts much longer in their tomite phase, copper is often added to the tank for 14 to 25 days and works similarly as salt to destroy ich. However, using copper requires you to put in the exact and correct dosage and diligently check copper levels in your tank daily with a copper ion test kit. Do not use copper to treat freshwater fish because it could kill them. Always follow the instructions on the product. Remove the carbon from your filter as the carbon can neutralize or entrap medicines added to the tank. Copper combines with calcium carbonate or magnesium carbonate based rocks, sand, and gravel so be sure to only use copper in a bare tank. Copper is highly toxic for invertebrates, reefs, and plants. Separate invertebrates, reefs, and plants and treat them with other safe methods. These methods can be dubbed as dangerous alternatives to treating ich. Some even damage your fish and must be constantly monitored so levels don't reach to a point where your fish might die from the chemical. Always read the label of these chemical medicines and wear protective clothes like gloves and goggles when handling them. Some treatments are: Malachite green: Similar to chemotherapy in humans, malachite green works to damage all cell's ability to produce energy which is vital for metabolic processes. This chemical doesn't differentiate from a fish's cell to the cell of an ich parasite. Formalin: Formalin kills microorganisms by reacting with a cell's proteins and nucleic acids which alter the cell's function and structure and often used to preserve biological specimens. It can damage your filter system, deplete oxygen levels and kill invertebrates or weaker fish. Summary:","completion":"Treating ich in your pet fish involves several careful steps that mainly involve ensuring the cleanliness of the tank and cautiously administering the right medication. Start by performing a water change, vacuuming your gravel and removing carbon from your filter, as these actions create a cleaner environment for the medication to work effectively. For saltwater ich, copper is often used for a period of 14 to 25 days, however, the dosage must be exact and copper levels should be checked daily with a test kit. It's important to remember not to use copper in freshwater tanks as it could be lethal for fish. Also, copper should only be used in a bare tank as it reacts with rocks, sand, gravel based on calcium or magnesium carbonate, and is also toxic for invertebrates, reefs, and plants. These should be separated and treated with safe methods. Be aware that using such methods may be risky and damaging to your fish, hence regular monitoring is required. Two somewhat dangerous treatments for ich include Malachite green and Formalin. Malachite green damages the cell's ability to produce energy which is vital for metabolic processes, while Formalin reacts with a cell's proteins and nucleic acids, altering their function and structure. It's important to read labels, use protective gear when handling these chemicals and to monitor the levels diligently to avoid harm to your fish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Birds navigate during migration using a variety of methods. For diurnal migrants, the sun is used to navigate by day, and a stellar compass is used at night. Birds that use the sun compensate for the changing position of the sun during the day by the use of an internal clock. Orientation with the stellar compass depends on the position of the constellations surrounding Polaris. These are backed up in some species by their ability to sense the Earth's geomagnetism through specialised photoreceptors.

When we talk about disarmament and demobilization, it's like we're deciding to take away some of those toy soldiers and weapons and give them to other kids to play with, so that we have fewer of them and can play more peacefully. Now, to find evidence that this has happened in real life, we can look at a few examples: 1. The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT): This is an agreement where many countries have promised not to build any more of the most powerful and dangerous weapons (like when our parents tell us not to play with sharp objects). The NPT has helped to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and many countries have even given up their nuclear weapons because of it. 2. The end of the Cold War: A long time ago, there were two \\"teams\\" of countries that didn't really like each other - the United States and its friends on one side, and the Soviet Union and its friends on the other. They had lots and lots of weapons to fight each other if they had to. But when these two teams started talking and becoming friends, they began to reduce their weapons so that they could play more peacefully together. This is an example of disarmament and demobilization. 3. United Nations Peacekeeping Missions: Sometimes, countries have problems and start fighting with each other. The United Nations (UN) is like a teacher at school who steps in to help when kids can't get along. The UN has sent groups of people (called peacekeepers) to these troubled areas to help those countries find a peaceful solution and to make sure that they don't use their weapons to hurt each other anymore. This is a form of demobilization as the fighting countries agree to stop fighting and work together. These are just some examples, but they show that disarmament and demobilization have occurred in the real world, just like when we decide to share our toy soldiers and weapons with others and play nicely together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Movie title: The Karate Kid Context: Twelve-year-old Dre Parker and his mother Sherry Parker move from Detroit to Beijing after Sherry gets a job transfer at her car factory. After a day in a Chinese park, Dre develops a crush on a young violinist, Meiying, who reciprocates his attention, but Cheng, a rebellious kung fu prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, attempts to keep the two young ones apart by violently attacking Dre, and later bullies him at school, as Dre is too weak to stand up for himself. During an attack one day, the maintenance man, Mr. Han, comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as an ancient kung fu master. After Han mends Dre's injuries using fire cupping, Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu to get revenge on his attackers. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to make peace. Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Seeing a poster for an open martial arts tournament, Han instead proposes that Dre compete against Li's students there. He also requests that the stronger students that Li teaches leave Dre alone to train in time for the tournament, in hopes Dre will no longer be bullied. Li accepts the offer, but tells Han that if Dre does not show up, there will trouble for both Han and Dre. Han promises to teach Dre \\"real\\" kung fu and begins to train Dre by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art.

I suppose on my side we'd take the same view that the Pentagon took of Abu Ghraib: a few bad apples on the night shift.\\" Meanwhile, on the right, the story is the biggest scandal since the leak of the Pentagon Papers. Seemingly unperturbed by the CRU embarrassment, President Obama will shortly jet to Copenhagen to pledge reductions in U.S. carbon emissions. The Democratic majority in Congress continues to work on a cap-and-trade bill. At the same time, Gallup has recorded an amazing 20 point drop since summer 2008 in the number of Republicans who believe that global warming is occurring. Among Republican conservatives, the drop is slightly smaller -- 13 points -- but that's because so few of them believed in the reality of global warming in the first place. It used to be said that we were all entitled to our own opinions, but not entitled to our own facts. No more. In modern America, we choose our facts to fit our opinions. Michael Barone drove this point home in a 2008 column for the magazine of the American Enterprise Institute:. Americans' views of the economy are increasingly a function of voting behavior or party loyalty, rather than the other way around. In early 2006, a time of vibrant economic growth, 56 percent of Republicans said the economy was excellent or good, while only 28 percent of independents and 23 percent of Democrats agreed. Maybe Republicans were just doing better than Democrats? No -- the partisan divergence held true among Republicans and Democrats even of the same income level. The same effect showed up in reverse in the 1990s. Under President Clinton, Democrats were more likely to assess the economy positively than were Republicans of the same income level. Media critics often blame cable, talk radio and blogs for isolating the public into self-satisfied information communities. And for sure, Fox News, MSNBC, Rush Limbaugh and the Daily Show have done good business serving niche markets. But it's a real question: What is cause and what is effect? Maybe customers always wanted to have their pre-existing opinions confirmed. Notice how often 19th century newspapers had names like the \\"Clay County Whig\\" or the \\"Jacksonville Democrat.\\" What were these old county papers if not the Fox News and MSNBC of their day? The whole global warming debate has been distorted from the start by intellectual self-ghettoization. Suffused by self-righteousness, the East Anglian scientists felt entitled to twist the evidence and delete the counter-evidence. iReport: Share your thoughts on climate change. But it also helped that they felt sure they would not be caught. They had defined their community in a way that excluded skepticism, that defined skeptics as the enemy, as liars, as Holocaust deniers. Private e-mails and documents allegedly from the servers at the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit, a world-renowned center on the study of climate change, are thought to have been leaked by hackers. Everything important about global warming remains disputed:. How fast is it happening? How much of it is attributable to human activity? How dangerous is it? How much should we pay to avert or mitigate it? Who should do the paying? How are to begin to reach conclusions if we cannot even agree on the rules of discussion? The most famous public document on global warming calls itself \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" -- and yet that document itself is filled with untruths, on every subject from sea levels to polar bears. (The bears are doing fine, populations at record levels in the Canadian Arctic.) In his first book, \\"Earth in the Balance,\\" former Vice President Al Gore wrote that human consciousness itself may be the most important obstacle to environmental improvement. He spoke more accurately than he knew. The global warming controversy has been pervaded from the start by the human instinct to divide the world into \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" -- and then believe only the news we hear from \\"us.\\" Global warming advocates can see this weakness in their opponents. It was the same weakness in themselves that led the advocates themselves to cheat and twist and betray scientific standards and public trust. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","completion":"1.

While visiting a health studio in Beverly Hills, fashion model Jennifer Downing, the daughter of millionaire P.J. Downing, is kidnapped. Her father turns to a family friend, Eliot Draisen, who is president of the detective agency Crumb & Crumb, to investigate the case. Eliot is reluctant to supply P.J. with one of his capable detectives because, as it turns out, Eliot himself is the organizer of the kidnapping. To give the appearance of taking the investigation seriously, Eliot offers P.J. the services of Harry Crumb, the last descendant of the agency's founders. Eliot knows that Harry is incompetent and counts on this fact to get away with the crime. Harry returns to Los Angeles (by bus) from an assignment in the firm's Tulsa, Oklahoma branch office (which he messed up, as usual). He is assisted in his investigation by P.J.'s younger daughter, Nikki, who is considerably smarter than he is. Harry deduces that Nikki's stepmother, Helen Downing, is having an affair with tennis coach Vince Barnes, and concludes she is behind the kidnapping. Helen is desired by Eliot, but all she is interested in is money. She tries to get rid of her husband on several occasions and does her best – along with Barnes – to get the ransom for herself.

Swansea City Supporters Trust are wary of external investment in a club that, in recent years, has been heralded for its ownership model and local backing. But chairman Huw Jenkins said last month the club were ‘miles behind’ their rivals in commercial income and needed to consider alternative revenues in order to compete. Swansea manager Garry Monk has urged fans to have faith with the board over investment talks. It is understood they are now in talks with American millionaire John Jay Moores, as well as his long-time associate Charles Noell. Moores, 70, previously owned the San Diego Padres Major League Baseball franchise in California and a Swansea source told Sportsmail that the Texan is discussing the possibility of purchasing an equity stake in the club, though no offers have yet been made. The club have refused to confirm or deny Moores is in talks. Swansea’s current board has taken the club from League Two to the Premier League and Monk said on Thursday: ‘It's important as a club that we look to push forward. ‘The way to do that is maybe attract other interest and other investment and there are areas of the club that need to be strengthened - facility-wise, commercially, infrastructure and expansion of the stadium. ‘What I would say is over the last 10-11 years you speak to everyone who's been involved at this club and Huw and the board have always made the decisions with the best interests of the club in mind. ‘It's not about someone coming in and taking over everything - people should have trust in the board that they will do whatever's best for the good of Swansea.’ Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins (centre) has helped club go from League Two to the Premier League. He added: ‘The bigger clubs are going to stretch away with more money and the clubs that are left behind must try to stay on their heels enough to compete. ‘This is a way of doing it and that's what the club is looking at.

The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete, occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world. However, one bit of the Irish stereotype is true, their love for drink. Drinking in Ireland is a job, but it's not necessarily something to criticize. It was the Irish after all who created one of the world's best-loved beers, Guinness. Where did the negative Irish stereotype come from? A) From their everyday behavior towards other people. B) From the behavior of Irish immigrants to the America in the 19thcentury. C) From the historical records of the 19thcentury Ireland. D) From most people's impression of the Irish people. Answer:","completion":"B) From the behavior of Irish immigrants to America in the 19th century. The negative Irish stereotype emerged mainly from the 19th-century experiences of Irish immigrants in the United States. At that time, Ireland was suffering from poverty and famine, resulting in a large number of Irish people seeking a better life in America. However, upon arrival in the United States, they faced competition for jobs and housing alongside other immigrant groups. This led to occasional fights and altercations with other communities, resulting in the stereotype of Irish people as hot-tempered and fond of fighting. Over time, other aspects of the Irish stereotype developed, such as their reputation for drinking alcohol and telling tall tales. Nonetheless, this stereotype does not reflect the reality of Irish people today, who are known for their storytelling skills, musical talents, and friendly nature. Famous Irish writers like James Joyce and Samuel Beckett have contributed to the literary world, and popular music groups like U2 and Enya have showcased Ireland's musical prowess. The Irish culture's relationship with drinking is undeniable, as evidenced by the world-renowned Guinness beer. Still, the negative stereotype primarily came from the experiences and behavior of 19th-century Irish immigrants in the United States. Today, Ireland is recognized for its rich cultural and artistic heritage, debunking the stereotype as outdated and far from the modern Irish way of life."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Keeping everyone involved has always been Robert's responsibility which is now Dennis's; OPTIONS: -- Robert has passed the torch.; -- Dennis has passed the torch.;","completion":"Keeping everyone involved has always been Robert's responsibility which is now Dennis's; a transition that symbolizes the passing of the torch as Robert steps back to allow his protégé to take the helm. This change in leadership roles and distribution of responsibilities emphasizes the importance of adaptability, collaboration, and growth within the organization. As Robert has passed the torch to Dennis, it is crucial for him to provide guidance and mentorship while allowing Dennis the autonomy to make decisions and navigate the complexities of the role. This show of trust and faith in Dennis's capabilities will foster a healthy working relationship and allow for a smoother transition as the organization adapts to the new leadership structure. Dennis, on the other hand, now has the responsibility to maintain Robert's legacy of keeping everyone involved while simultaneously establishing his own style of leadership. This can be achieved through open communication, valuing input from team members, and promoting a sense of belonging. By creating a collaborative environment, Dennis can build trust with the team, improve morale, and ultimately maintain high levels of productivity and achievement. While Dennis has accepted the torch passed down by Robert, it is essential for him to recognize the significance of this gesture. This act of entrusting leadership denotes the confidence in Dennis's ability to steer the organization towards success while upholding its values and objectives. In order to do this, Dennis must be prepared to tackle challenges head-on, learn from his predecessors, seek advice from his colleagues, and – most importantly – be willing to evolve and adapt as the needs of the organization change. In taking on this new responsibility, Dennis must prioritize effective communication with team members, ensuring that they are well-informed of any shifts in strategy or methods. Furthermore, he should be prepared to foster innovation, advocate for continuous improvement, and provide opportunities for professional growth and development. By embracing these practices, Dennis will be better equipped to keep everyone involved and aligned with the organization's overarching goals. The passing of the torch signifies not only the transition of leadership but also the responsibility to carry forward the values and traditions instilled by previous leaders like Robert. Leveraging the lessons learned from their experience, while adapting to new challenges, will determine the ultimate success of Dennis's tenure and ability to effectively involve all members of the organization. Embracing change and the willingness to continuously learn and grow will serve as the guiding principles for maintaining strong team dynamics and fostering a prosperous future under Dennis's leadership."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rub the clay with petroleum jelly. Combine hard clay with fresh clay. Article:","completion":"Title: How to Soften and Mix Clay for Little Artists Hello little friends! Today, we're going to learn how to make your clay softer and easier to play with. Sometimes, clay can be hard and tough to shape, but don't worry! I'm here to help you. Just follow these easy steps and you'll have soft and smooth clay in no time. 1. Add in some liquid diluent. A liquid diluent is a special kind of liquid that helps make things softer. Just like adding water to your juice makes it less strong, adding some liquid diluent to your clay will make it softer. Ask a grown-up to help you add a few drops of liquid diluent into your clay and mix it around. 2. Use a bar of clay softener. A clay softener is a little bar that looks like soap, but it's made to help soften clay. Gently rub the clay softener on your hard clay like you're coloring with a crayon. This will help break down the hard pieces and make the clay softer. 3. Add in liquid clay. Liquid clay is clay that's already soft and watery. You can find it in a small bottle at the craft store. Ask a grown-up to help you squirt a little bit of liquid clay into your hard clay and mix it around. This will make your clay much softer and easier to work with. 4. Add some mineral oil. Mineral oil is a clear, slippery liquid that can help make your clay softer too. Ask an adult to help you add a few drops of mineral oil and mix it into your clay. The oil will help the clay get all smooth and slippery, making it easier for you to shape and play with. 5. Rub the clay with petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly is a thick, gooey gel that you might have at home for dry skin. It can also help your clay become softer! Put a little bit of petroleum jelly on your fingers and rub it all over your clay. Then, keep playing with the clay until it feels nice and soft. 6. Combine hard clay with fresh clay. If your clay is still too hard, you can always mix it with a little bit of fresh, soft clay. Split your hard clay into smaller pieces and then squish it together with some new clay. Keep mixing and playing with the clay until it's all soft and ready for you to create your next masterpiece! Now that your clay is all soft, you can use your hands and imagination to create anything you want! Make some cute animals, fun shapes, or even characters from your favorite cartoons. Have fun and enjoy playing with your freshly softened clay!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Phil Skinner played a key role in 20th century development of the mandolin movement in Australia, and was awarded an MBE in 1979 for services to music and the community. He was born Harry Skinner in Sydney in 1903 and started learning music at age 10 when his uncle tutored him on the banjo. Skinner began teaching part-time at age 18, until the Great Depression forced him to begin teaching full-time and learn a broader range of instruments. Skinner founded the Sydney Mandolin Orchestra, the oldest surviving mandolin orchestra in Australia. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): When did the African mandolin movement begin?","completion":"The African mandolin movement, though not as clearly documented or defined as the mandolin movement in other countries, likely emerged during the colonial and post-colonial periods as African musicians began embracing and incorporating various European and American musical instruments, including the mandolin, into their native music. The early beginnings of the African mandolin movement can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries when European settlers and colonizers introduced various Western instruments to Africa. However, it wasn't until the mid-20th century that the mandolin started to appear more frequently in the African music scene, particularly in areas such as Congo, Zimbabwe, Mali, and Senegal. One notable example is the Zimbabwean musician Kamba Simango who played the mandolin in the 1950s and 1960s as part of the unique Tsabatsaba music genre which blended traditional African tunes with Western musical styles. Similarly, in Congo, the influence of Cuban son music in the 1940s and 1950s led to the emergence of the popular Congolese Rumba and Soukous genres, in which the mandolin was occasionally featured. Over time, the usage of the mandolin in African music diversified and became more widespread, with musicians continuing to experiment and adapt various Western musical styles and instruments. For instance, the Malian musician Ali Farka Touré, known for combining traditional Malian music with American blues, often played the mandolin (or mandolin-like instruments like the ngoni) on his recordings, further solidifying its place in contemporary African music in the 1970s and 1980s. While it is difficult to pinpoint a specific year or event that marked the beginning of the African mandolin movement, it is evident that its roots can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with a more noticeable emergence in the mid-20th century due to various cultural exchanges and the blending of musical styles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Host--parasite coevolution is a special case of coevolution, which is defined as the reciprocal adaptive genetic change of two antagonists (e.g. different species or genes) through reciprocal selective pressures. In the particular case of host--parasite coevolution the antagonists are different species of host and parasite. Can we conclude that can a parasite influence the evolution of its host?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that a parasite can influence the evolution of its host. Host-parasite coevolution is a dynamic process where both the host and the parasite continually adapt and counter-adapt to each other's strategies, leading to a series of reciprocal changes in their respective genetic compositions, phenotypes, and population dynamics. This interdependence and constant selective pressure drive the evolutionary trajectory of both organisms, often leading to complex and specialized adaptations. There are several key aspects of host-parasite coevolution that support the conclusion that a parasite can influence the evolution of its host: 1. Red Queen Hypothesis: This hypothesis, named after the Red Queen character from Lewis Carroll's \\"Through the Looking Glass,\\" posits that in a coevolving system, both the host and the parasite must continually evolve in order to maintain their relative fitness levels. In this never-ending race, the host evolves to counter the parasite's infection or pathogenic strategies, while the parasite concurrently adapts to exploit the host more efficiently. This constant arms race results in the ongoing evolution of both the host and the parasite. 2. Parasite-mediated selection: The presence of parasites can exert strong selective pressures on host populations, resulting in the selection of individuals or traits that confer resistance or tolerance to parasitic infections. This can lead to changes in the host's genetic composition or the evolution of novel defense mechanisms. An example of this is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in vertebrates, which plays a crucial role in the immune response against pathogens. High levels of MHC diversity have been observed in various species, suggesting an evolutionary advantage due to the wide range of potential parasite exposures. 3. Host shifts and speciation: In some cases, the adaptation of a parasite to a new host species may drive evolutionary changes in the host, leading to the emergence of new host species. This is particularly relevant when the parasite has a strong influence on host survival and reproduction, as it encourages the development of host-specific adaptations to escape parasitism. The result can be increased specialization and divergence between host populations, eventually leading to speciation events. 4. Population-level effects: Parasites can influence the spatial distribution, demographic structure, and genetic diversity of host populations. By regulating the size and composition of host populations, parasites contribute to the forces of selection acting on host populations. For example, parasites can cause local extinctions or metapopulation dynamics, where a balance between colonization and extinction influences the spatial distribution and genetic diversity of both hosts and parasites. 5. Coevolutionary hotspots and coldspots: Local adaptation can lead to geographic variation in the degree of adaptation and counter-adaptation between host and parasite. This variation results in 'coevolutionary hotspots' where parasite-mediated selection is particularly strong, and 'coevolutionary coldspots' where selection is weak. Such variation can further drive the evolutionary dynamics of host populations, contributing to population divergence and speciation. Overall, the host-parasite coevolutionary process demonstrates that parasites can indeed influence the evolution of their hosts. This dynamic relationship between the two antagonists continuously shapes the adaptive landscape, ultimately driving the long-term evolutionary trajectories of both host and parasite species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

School is also the place where you learn to get on well with people. But this is not always easy. What can you do if you just don't like one of your classmates? If you discover that you have problems getting on with your classmates or friends, the most important thing to learn is tolerance. Tolerance is the ability to realize and respect the differences in others. We can not change the way that other people do, so it is important to learn to live happily with them. Tolerance will make everyone get on better with each other. Getting to know someone may help you understand why they do things differently. Something different does not exactly mean that it is bad. Tolerance teaches us to keep a _ and open mind. You need to remember an old saying, \\"Treat others how you want to be treated\\". If you tolerate something, it does not mean that you have to like it. No one is asking you to change who you are or what you believe in. Tolerance just means that you should respect the differences in others and not try to make them change. It is important to practice tolerance, because it will make everyone's life easier. Learn to accept people for their different abilities and interests. The world is very different, and practicing tolerance in your own school and city can help make a difference.

French cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign, and Eisenhower encountered a \\"preposterous situation\\" with the multiple rival factions in France. His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia, and intending to facilitate that objective, he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa, despite Darlan's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces. The Allied leaders were \\"thunderstruck\\" by this from a political standpoint, though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation. Eisenhower was severely criticized for the move. Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle. Eisenhower did not take action to prevent the arrest and extrajudicial execution of Bonnier de La Chapelle by associates of Darlan acting without authority from either Vichy or the Allies, considering it a criminal rather than a military matter. Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner, who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan's commander-in-chief, and who had refused to postpone the execution.

Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods. But I can use this background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. What is an answer for this question: Which town had less growth of water plants because of fertilizer? Answer:","completion":"Small town had less growth of water plants because of fertilizer. In this situation, Big town relied on the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in their agricultural practices, while Small town employed permaculture principles and organic farming methods. The use of chemicals in agriculture, as implemented by Big town, can lead to a series of negative environmental consequences. As fertilizers and pesticides are applied to farm fields, they can be washed off by rainwater and carried to nearby rivers and lakes. When fertilizer dissolves into these water bodies, it promotes excessive growth of water plants and algae, a phenomenon known as eutrophication. The overgrowth of these organisms can lead to oxygen depletion in the water, causing the formation of dead zones where aquatic life is unable to survive. On the other hand, Small town's approach towards agriculture, permaculture and organic farming, typically avoids the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Permaculture methods focus on designing agricultural systems that mimic the natural environment, thereby encouraging biodiversity and sustainable agricultural practices. Organic farming methods emphasize the use of natural inputs, such as compost and green manures, to nourish crops. These practices help maintain the health of the soil, while minimizing the risk of chemical runoff into water bodies. By resisting the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, Small town's agricultural practices substantially reduce the potential for water pollution and excessive plant growth in nearby rivers and lakes. Furthermore, the permaculture principles and organic farming methods provide a more sustainable agricultural system that prioritizes the well-being of the local ecosystem. Therefore, Small town had less growth of water plants because of the minimal use of fertilizer in their agricultural practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I'm not really sure how to even begin to describe how bad this movie is. I like bad films, as they are often the most entertaining. I love bad special effects, bad acting, bad music, and inept direction. With the exception of the music (which was better than I had expected), this movie had all of those qualities. The special effects were amazingly bad. The worst I've seen since my Nintendo 64. Some scenes to watch for include the Thunderchild, the woman being crushed by the mechanical foot, the Big Ben scene, the train wreck... Wow, there are so many bad effects! On the plus side, though, SOME scenes of the alien walkers are well done. The acting was about as bad as it could possibly have been, having been based directly on H.G. Wells' book. For having such good source material, it's almost as though the actors were trying to be so over-the-top as to make it funny. And then there's the mustache... the single most distracting piece of facial hair I've seen in a long time. Of course, only half the movie contains acting. The rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots. To say that Timothy Hines is an inept director would be an injustice to inept directors. With the use of different colored filters between shots for no particular reason, the use of poorly rendered backgrounds for even inside scenes, the bad green screening, it's amazing to me how this man ever got approval to direct a movie. I wouldn't imagine it would be possible to turn a brilliant book into this bad a movie. Bravo, Mr. Hines. Bravo. My advice to anyone who plans to see this movie is to do what I did: have some friends who enjoy bad movies over, drink, play poker while watching it, keep drinking, and maybe you'll make it all the way through. It does make for an excellent bad movie, so have fun and laugh yourself silly with this disaster.

What is the best way to: How to make drill guide holes for a wood project.","completion":"The best way to make drill guide holes for a wood project is by following a systematic and step-by-step approach that ensures precision, safety, and a professional-looking outcome. Here's a thorough method to help you achieve this: 1. Gather the necessary tools and materials: - Power drill or drill press - Drill bits (appropriately sized for the intended screw or dowel) - Woodwork clamps - Ruler or tape measure - Carpenter's square - Marking tools (pencil, marking gauge, or awl) - Wood scrap or backer board - Doweling jig or drill guide (optional) 2. Select the appropriate drill bit: Choose a drill bit that matches the size of the dowel or screw you plan to use. The bit should be slightly smaller than the dowel or screw to ensure a tight fit. For pilot holes, use a drill bit that matches the thread diameter of the screw. 3. Mark the drilling locations: Using a ruler and carpenter's square, accurately measure and mark the exact locations where you want to drill the guide holes on the workpiece. Be precise and ensure that each marking is consistent with your woodworking plan to avoid errors. 4. Secure the workpiece: To prevent the workpiece from moving during drilling, clamp it firmly to a sturdy surface or workbench. If necessary, use a wood scrap or backer board underneath the workpiece to reduce any tear-out as the drill bit exits the wood. 5. Use a doweling jig or drill guide (optional): To ensure perfectly straight and even guide holes, consider using a doweling jig or drill guide. These tools help maintain accurate angles and proper alignment while drilling. Simply set the desired depth and angle, clamp the tool onto the workpiece, and align it with your markings. 6. Drill the guide holes: Begin by making a small indent at each marked location using an awl or the tip of the drill bit. This helps to guide the drill bit and prevent it from slipping off the mark. With the drill in a vertical position and the bit aligned with the marked spot, start drilling slowly while applying consistent pressure. If you're not using a drill guide, keep your drill as perpendicular to the workpiece as possible to keep the hole straight. 7. Monitor depth during drilling: To drill holes at a consistent depth, use a depth stop on your drill or mark the desired depth on your drill bit using a piece of masking tape. When the tape reaches the surface of the workpiece, stop drilling. 8. Clean the holes: After drilling, remove any wood chips or debris from the holes with a small brush or by blowing air into the holes. This ensures a better fit for screws or dowels. 9. Test the fit: Place the dowel or screw into the guide hole to verify a snug fit. If it's too tight, use a slightly larger drill bit to widen the hole. If it's too loose, you may need to plug the hole with wood filler and start again with a smaller drill bit. 10. Repeat the process: Once you've achieved the desired result for one hole, follow the same steps for all the other guide holes in your wood project. This will ensure consistency and accuracy across the entire piece. By following these steps, you can create precise and accurate drill guide holes in your wood projects, resulting in a professional and high-quality finish."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Known for his unrivaled athleticism and dynamic play style, Jackson earned accolades in both sports, making his mark as one of the most prolific multi-sport athletes of all time. He played as a baseball outfielder for the Kansas City Royals, Chicago White Sox, and California Angels in the Major League Baseball (MLB). In contrast, he also shone on the football field, playing as a running back for the Los Angeles Raiders in the National Football League (NFL). His extraordinary feats earned him spots as an all-star in both sports, a rare achievement that highlights his incredible talent and versatility. On the other hand, Brent Fullwood is acknowledged for his proficiency in one single sport - football. Fullwood was a professional football player in the NFL, notably for the Green Bay Packers. He rose to popularity as a running back – the same position Jackson played in his football career.

I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

To elaborate further, the term specifically refers to a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk, in the family Raphitomidae. In the categorization, \\"Daphnella dilecta\\" can't be a company, as its name structure and context don't align with how companies are usually named. This term is also not typical for an educational institution, an artist, an athlete, or an office holder, as human names or specific institutional names are usually in these categories. Furthermore, \\"Daphnella dilecta\\" doesn't fit the pattern for a means of transportation, a building, a natural place, or a village, as these categories usually have distinct naming conventions and the name \\"Daphnella dilecta\\" does not match those. In the context of an album, film, or written work, while it's possible for these to have a wide variety of names, there's no known album, film, or written work titled \\"Daphnella dilecta\\". As for a plant, while plant taxonomy can sometimes have complex Latin names, proper research shows that \\"Daphnella dilecta\\" is not recognized as a plant species. So, by the process of elimination and specific research, \\"Daphnella dilecta\\" most closely aligns with the category of an animal, specifically a type of sea snail. This is affirmed by field-specific knowledge in zoology and paleontology, specifically in malacology – the branch of invertebrate zoology that deals with the study of the Mollusca (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest phylum of invertebrate animals after the arthropods.

Threats of possible flash floods and landslides as well as possible storm waves are occurring in coastal areas.\\" Hagupit is expected to roll into the South China Sea tomorrow. It's currently going westward toward the southern tip of Vietnam, meaning it's unlikely to affect China.

When an individual selects this \\"other\\" box, they are grouped together with various other multiracial types. This means that people of mixed race or ethnicity, such as those having European American/African-American backgrounds, are grouped together with those having other mixed racial backgrounds, such as Asian/Native American Indian. The main reason or usage of this box is to accommodate the people from mixed or varied racial or ethnic backgrounds that don't fit into the mostly single-race categories provided.

However, the seeds in the plain didn't have the same luck. You see, they had a problem: they didn't get enough sunlight. You know how plants need light from the sun to grow big and healthy, right? That's called photosynthesis, but we can think of it as plant food that comes from sunlight. Because the plain had inadequate sunlight, the seeds there couldn't grow into strong plants like their hill friends. They struggled and eventually died, leaving the plain without any plants. The plants on the hill felt sad for their friends down in the plain, so they came up with a great idea! They could ask the Sun to shine a little more on the plain, so the seeds could grow into beautiful, strong plants just like them. The Sun, being a kind and caring friend, agreed to shine a little more light on the plain. Slowly but surely, the seeds in the plain started getting more and more sunlight, and they began to grow! With time and the right amount of sunlight, the seeds in the plain became strong, healthy plants. The hill and the plain were filled with happy plants, and the entire kingdom looked more beautiful than ever before.

Please answer the following question: This is part two of a four part series on Inner Wisdom Eating (IWE) The 4 steps of Inner Wisdom Eating (or eating like a thin person) are exactly the same as those promoted by Intuitive Eating. Eat when you’re hungry Eat what you want Eat consciously Stop when you are full The difference lies in the approach and the detail. I will discuss each step in this four part series. ————————————————— EAT WHAT YOU WANT DOES YOUR FOOD SING TO YOU? Have a look in your fridge and cupboards. Does the food in there sing to you, does it call your name, and are you looking forward to eating it? Do you eat it because you enjoy it or because you think you should? By choosing only to eat what sings to me, I have discovered (again!) that I am not a big fan of meat and would rather eat a predominantly vegetarian diet. Occasionally I’ll eat chicken leg and I love bacon but beyond that I’m not fussed. FOOD DOES NOT HAVE A VALUE There are no good and bad foods. There are no trigger foods or forbidden foods. There is nosuch thing as junk. There is a place in your diet for your favourite indulgences in moderation. Believe me that when you let yourself eat cheesecake, chocolate and hot chips, the novelty soon wears off. I mostly eat unprocessed food, not because it’s “good” but because I love the taste and prefer how it makes me feel. YOU CAN STILL EAT DIET FOOD Low fat ice-cream, Diet Coke and protein powder are still in my diet but I eat them because I prefer the taste over their ‘real’ counterparts. I can still ask for dressing on the side and no butter on my sandwich not because I’m counting calories but because I can’t see the point in eating food I don’t actually want.

Some foods are no good for people C. people can make choices and eat well if they eat in moderation D. not enough information === The correct answer is A:","completion":"C. People can make choices and eat well if they eat in moderation. The author believes that food should be enjoyable and that individuals should feel excited to eat it, as described with food \\"singing\\" or calling one's name. This perspective avoids labeling certain food as good or bad or setting strict diet rules. Instead, the author highlights how important it is to listen to one's inner wisdom and choose foods that resonate with one's preferences and personal needs. The author emphasizes that there is no such thing as junk food or forbidden food and that even indulgences can have a place in a person's diet, as long as they are consumed in moderation. The concept of IWE suggests that allowing yourself to eat foods that are conventionally seen as \\"bad\\" can eventually lead to a more balanced diet, as the novelty of eating these foods wears off over time. Moreover, the author acknowledges that even processed or low-fat foods can be part of a person's diet if they genuinely enjoy them and feel satisfied. They give examples of low-fat ice-cream, Diet Coke, and protein powder, stating that they consume them because they prefer their taste over traditional alternatives. In conclusion, the author believes that everyone can make choices and eat well if they practice moderation and listen to their inner wisdom, aiming for a balanced and enjoyable diet that resonates with their unique preferences and needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Supercars for the 21st century: The very best from Ferrari, BMW, Porsche, Acura and McLaren To the consumer, supercars represent the ultimate dream machines. Fast, sexy, and stratospherically priced, they are the cars we'd buy if we won the lottery. To automakers, they are showcases for the very best engineering a company can achieve and the newest technology it has mastered. The latest technology adopted by the supercar world is electrification. Starting this year and moving into next, five new supercars will debut that make use of some form of electrification. They are the Acura NSX, BMW i8, Ferrari LaFerrari, McLaren P1, and Porsche 918 Spyder. Ridiculous power and better handling The electric motors in all five of these cars boost power, but the Ferrari, McLaren, and Porsche use electricity to produce unholy gobs of thrust. The horsepower figures for these three cars are 950-hp, 903-hp, and 887-hp, respectively. \\"In order to get the level of powertrain performance to achieve our targets, one of the ways to go was to go with a hybrid powertrain,\\" said Chris Goodwin, McLaren Automotive's chief test driver. The electric motor in the new 1.1 million P1 enabled McLaren to boost an engine that makes 641-horsepower in the McLaren 650S by 262-horsepower for use in the P1 hyper-exotic. In the BMW i8, the electric motor works with a small three-cylinder engine to create a car that can launch from 0 to 60 mph in a scant 4.2 seconds. That’s impressive, but get ready to hold on tight. The similarly stunning Porsche 918 is even faster! \\"Designing the 918 Spyder to utilize not only a powerful V-8 engine but also an E-Hybrid system allowed us to achieve outstanding performance,\\" said Trent Warnke, Porsche's e-mobility project manager. \\"Where else can you get 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds, top track speed of 214 mph, and 67 MPGe?\\" In all five of these cars, the electric motor does more than just add horsepower. It also helps fills in the holes in the gasoline engine's power delivery. The McLaren P1's 3.8-liter V-8, for example, uses two large turbochargers – a performance addition that tends to cause a lag in power delivery off the line. According to Goodwin, the electric motor compliments the combustion engine: \\"We call it torque fill because it's allowed us to create whatever torque curve we want. That torque fill has given us instantaneous throttle response.\\" Electric motors can also aid handling. That's the case with the Acura NSX, BMW i8, and Porsche 918. All of these cars use electric motors on the front axle, and the torque supplied by those motors can be applied positively or negatively to help the car rotate through a turn. \\"When you have the ability to control the torque to the front axle, either dragging the inside wheel, overdriving the outside wheel, doing both at the same time, you can do things dynamically others aren't doing. You can create a unique cornering experience,\\" said Sage Marie, Acura's senior manager of public relations. Among the automakers electrifying their supercars, BMW is the one most concerned with a sustainable future. The curvaceous i8 sports car is part of the new i sub-brand, which is BMW's effort to build efficient cars from recyclable materials, and to promote energy sustainability. \\"What does the sports car of the future look like when your natural resources are not as abundant,\\" asks BMW i product manager Jose Guerrero. The answer is the i8, a car that delivers 362-horsepower and fuel economy that could be in the 70 to 90 MPG range (EPA fuel economy figures aren't yet available). Despite the BMW i brand's focus on sustainability, the i8 won't make a significant contribution to BMW's Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) numbers, which have to reach 54.5 MPG by 2025. That's because sales totals for the i8 will be too small to help the company's overall average. Same goes for the upcoming Acura NSX. However, BMW is also introducing the i3 electric car, and the company is making plans to use the lightweight components from these cars in other models throughout the lineup. It's a long-term strategy that should improve fuel mileage dramatically, across the brand’s entire range. The CAFE mileage numbers for Ferrari and McLaren, and to a lesser extent Porsche, could see a more immediate improvement. That's because these automakers sell a very limited number of vehicles, most of which are very hard on gas. Even small gains from electrification will improve the CAFE numbers for these automakers. \\"We recognize that the world is changing and as Porsche, we will lead with high performance yet environmentally responsible vehicles,\\" said Porsche's Warnke. A final factor to consider is the Zero Emissions Zone. In an effort to improve air quality, Low Emissions Zones that restrict access to vehicles with internal combustion engines are beginning to pop up in European cities. City centers such as Berlin and London may eventually designate Zero Emissions Zones that will ban all cars with internal combustion engines. Offering electric modes in supercars is one way to insure that high-end buyers won't be inconvenienced by these areas. As detailed above, the motivation to add electric propulsion to the most advanced supercars varies from brand to brand.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Gas chromatography apparatus (HP), model 5890, with flame ionization detectors (FID) and thermal conductivity detectors (TCD), and automatic sampler 6890 (or equivalent). The above statement has been translated from French to English. This statement refers to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) gas chromatography (GC) instrument, model 5890. Gas chromatography is a widely used technique for the separation and analysis of various volatile compounds in a mixture. The instrument mentioned in the statement is equipped with two types of detectors – flame ionization detectors (FID) and thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). Flame ionization detectors (FID) are used to detect and quantify organic compounds, particularly hydrocarbon compounds, that can be easily ionized in a flame. These compounds undergo pyrolytic fragmentation and form ions and electrons in the flame, which generates a current between two electrodes. The FID is sensitive, robust, and widely used in a variety of applications, including environmental monitoring, petrochemical analysis, and pharmaceutical studies. Thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) are universal detectors that can be used to detect virtually any compound, regardless of chemical or physical properties. They operate based on the difference in thermal conductivity between the carrier gas and the analyte. When the analyte passes through the detector, it causes a change in the heat distribution, thereby eliciting a measurable electrical response. TCDs are known for their stability, non-destructiveness, and suitability for wide range of analytes, making them suitable for applications such as environmental monitoring, industrial processes, and quality control. In addition to these detectors, the instrument is equipped with an automatic sampler, model 6890 (or an equivalent model). This sampler is responsible for introducing the sample mixture into the gas chromatograph without human intervention, minimizing sample loss and variability, improving accuracy and precision, and increasing analysis throughput. In conclusion, the gas chromatography apparatus mentioned in the French statement is a versatile and reliable analytical instrument, equipped with FID and TCD detectors and an automatic sampler for maximum efficiency and accuracy in various applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, that is not the correct answer to the question of how Bruce Lee died. Bruce Lee, born on November 27, 1940, was a legendary martial artist, actor, and philosopher, who is widely considered to be one of the most influential martial artists of all time. While it is true that he was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor, this information does not explain the circumstances of his death. Bruce Lee died on July 20, 1973, at the age of 32. His death was a result of a brain edema, which is a swelling of the brain caused by an excess of fluid. On that day, Lee complained of a headache and was given a prescription painkiller called Equagesic by an actress friend, Betty Ting Pei. He went to take a nap, and when he did not come down for dinner, Pei went to check on him, only to find him unresponsive. He was rushed to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong, but was pronounced dead on arrival. The precise cause of the brain edema remains a topic of debate to this day. While the official cause of death was listed as \\"death by misadventure,\\" some believe that Lee's brain edema may have resulted from an allergic reaction to the painkiller he was given, though this remains unconfirmed. Others speculate that it may have been due to over-exertion or pre-existing medical conditions. In conclusion, while Bruce Lee's early film career is an interesting facet of his life story, it does not address the circumstances of his death. Bruce Lee died from a brain edema, potentially related to a reaction to a painkiller medication, over-exertion, or an underlying medical condition."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: There are two major parties in Britain today,the Conservative and the Labour,which have been in power by turns since 1945.The twoparty system of Britain was formed in the course of the development of the capitalist state and the political parties. To strengthen the state machine,the British bourgeosie have let it come into being and exist in one form or another since the 17th century. P.S.Tregidgo once said,\\"The more parties there are,the less likely it is that any one of them will be strong enough in Parliament to control all the others; but when there are only two,one of them is sure to have a majority of seats. This helps to ensure a strong and stable government.\\" This explains why the British have the twoparty system. The division into two parties grew out the establishment of a Protestant Church of England in the 16th century. Because of a purely religious difference of opinion,the Puritans were separated from the broad body of the Anglican Church. The non Puritan Anglicans were on the side of the King and Church,whose supporters were called by their opponents \\"Tories\\".The Puritans were for Parliament and trade,whose supporters are called by the \\"Tories\\" \\"Whigs\\".The Tories and the Whigs were in power by turns for a long time. In 1833,the Tory Party split into two and its name was changed to Conservative. In the 1860s the Whigs became Liberals. Since then,the Liberals and the Conservatives were in office by turns until 1922.They have some different opinions,but were both controlled by the rich. The working class became more and more unwilling to follow the Conservatives and the Liberals. They wanted to have their own party. So the Labour Party was formed by the trade unions. After 1922,the Labour Party gradually replaced the Liberal Party. Question: According to the passage,why was the Labour Party established in Britain? Options: A: Because the trade unions did not do much good for the working people. B: Because the Liberal Party were not strong enough to defeat the Conservative Party. C: Because the working people would not like to be members outside the Liberal Party. D: Because neither of the two major parties was the parties for the working people. The answer to this question is:","completion":"D: Because neither of the two major parties was the parties for the working people."},{"prompt":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Athenians liked to watch?\\" is in \\"The Heptanesean kantádhes (καντάδες 'serenades'; sing.: καντάδα) became the forerunners of the Greek modern song, influencing its development to a considerable degree.

I asked her if there was any love between her and my dad. She stopped and raised her head in surprise. Then she went on with her work without saying anything. I was very worried because I thought I had hurt her feelings. But after a few minutes she said, \\"Look at this thread . Sometimes it appears, but most of the time it disappears in the quilt.

Answer based on context: Regent Moray and his secretary John Wood tried to gain English support by producing the Casket letters in England, which were intended to incriminate Mary in the death of Lord Darnley. Moray also raised money in London by selling items from the Scottish crown jewels, including what was claimed to be a unicorn horn. Queen Elizabeth and her advisors were at first reluctant to intervene but their actions, and support of Moray, served to prevent reconciliation in Scotland. The Regent Moray was assassinated in January 1570 by a member of the Hamilton family. Elizabeth sent an army into Scotland in May 1570, which reached Glasgow, where the Queen's party were besieging Glasgow Castle. The army was commanded by the Earl of Sussex from Berwick, its leader in Scotland was William Drury, styled \\"Captain General.\\" The Earl of Lennox was in their company, arriving at Edinburgh on 14 May 1570. The Marian lords abandoned their siege of Glasgow Castle before the English arrived on 18 May, and returned to their homelands, the Hamiltons to Arran and Craignethan Castle, and Drury attempted a siege of Dumbarton Castle. For Elizabeth's foreign policy this intervention had the effect of making France and Spain less likely to offer tangible pro-Marian support. After the Rising of the North and the discovery of the Ridolfi plot which further damaged Mary's reputation, Regent Mar and James Douglas, Earl of Morton were able to broker the deployment of an English army against Mary's supporters at Edinburgh Castle. The English diplomat Henry Killigrew worked on the reconciliation of the Scottish nobility at Perth in February 1572, where many promised not to support Mary as Queen. The fall of Edinburgh Castle concluded the civil war.

Here is a detailed analysis of the context that supports this hypothesis. 1. The context states that \\"Joe Perry is the first solo album by Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry.\\" This sentence highlights that Joe Perry, the album referred to, is the first solo work by Joe Perry, the guitarist from the band Aerosmith. Thus, indicating that this is his debut solo album. 2. The context also states, \\"Joe Perry is his first solo album without The Joe Perry Project.\\" The Joe Perry Project is likely another musical project that Joe worked on prior to his solo album. The mention of the project suggests it played a significant role in his career before he went solo, and \\"Joe Perry\\" was his first solo endeavor outside that project.

The context clearly indicates that \\"Joe Perry\\" is the first solo album by the Aerosmith guitarist, released on May 3, 2005, and it is his first solo attempt without The Joe Perry Project.

The girl was kept overnight in a police station after claiming she was raped by a man from a higher caste (file photo) A ten-year-old girl has been threatened with being stoned to death is she does not withdraw a rape claim against a neighbour from a higher caste. The family of the girl, who was detained in a women's police station alone for a night, is now under police protection amid the threats. Her mother took her to Kotwali women's police station after finding her unconscious in a field. The girl says a 35-year-old neighbour raped her, but the family says they are under pressure to drop the claim and accept a settlement instead. The mother told the Indian Express: 'They have been threatening to kill us, burn down our ancestral home and stone my daughter to death if we do not withdraw the rape case. 'Even the village panchayat (council), including the sarpanch (leader), is in favour of the accused and is asking the family to settle the matter.' An inquiry into why the girl was jailed for the night is underway with four officers from the station, near Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, suspended. A police superintendent told the Daily Telegraph that the girl's detention was a 'misunderstanding' while the family is under the impression it was to try to make them too scared to pursue the claim. Vaibhav Krishna, who is leading the inquiry into her overnight stay, said a man had been arrested for the alleged rape. But the man, from the Lodhe Rajputs caste, denied the allegation and claimed the girl had been scared after he told her off for picking tomatoes from a neighbour's field, ran away and made the claim. Superintendent Krishna said a medical examination was inconclusive as to whether an assault had taken place.

It's a set premise according to a law that gives power for certain actions to be carried out. This includes regulations, pacts, and treaties that provide basis for the formation or execution of other directives, guidelines etc. In any organized society, every action, particularly those carried out by the government or its agencies, must have a legal basis. Without some sort of legal basis, actions and decisions might be questioned and deemed invalid or illegal. It can be illustrated as a document or an article which authorizes an entity to perform certain functions or make particular decisions. Legal basis guarantees the rights and protection for citizens and provides a recognized framework for governing bodies to perform their duties and make decisions without infringing individual privileges or freedom. Whether there is a legal basis for specific actions or decisions referenced in your question depends on the jurisdiction and laws governing the place where those actions or decisions are made and the specifics of what actions are being taken. It could vary greatly depending on these factors. If the discussed actions are in contradiction with local or international law, even if the information is correct, they might not have a legal basis and lead to legal repercussions.

It's a beautifully paced nail-biter about a plot to relieve the Estonian treasury of a billion or so in gold. It's all shot in a gritty, grainy style that Hollywood rarely uses --- but it captures the atmosphere of the newly emancipated Baltic states beautifully (note: Tallin was actually looking a lot less grim in 2003 when I was there). There's a lot of humor and some romance, too. I don't want to spoil a number of startling yet logical surprises, so I'll just say this heist film starts from a great script, and the directing and performances are top notch.

Given the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\", is \\"wait for Alex to write back\\" a valid answer?","completion":"Based on the given scenario, Sasha is the one who sent the message to Alex. Therefore, the answer \\"wait for Alex to write back\\" would not necessarily be a valid answer to the question \\"What will Alex want to do next?\\", as it is more relevant to what Sasha might do after sending the message. A more appropriate answer for Alex's perspective could have more to do with considering his options upon receiving the message from Sasha or deciding whether to attend the meeting. Alex may have several different reactions upon reading this message, and the different possibilities can be categorized into three potential ways. However, it's important to note that these options are generalized, and clearer details about Alex and Sasha's relationship or past interactions may ultimately influence Alex's response more specifically. 1. Agree to meet up with Sasha and prepare for the meeting: In this case, Alex could accept Sasha's invitation and respond to let her know that he will meet her after school. If this outcome occurs, Alex may start thinking about possible conversation topics and might consider arriving at the meeting location slightly early to avoid being late. He might also want to ensure that he wraps up any school or extracurricular activities before the meeting, as not to conflict with his plans to meet Sasha. 2. Decline the meeting invitation and provide a reason: Suppose Alex cannot or does not wish to meet Sasha behind the store after school. In that case, he might respond to her message explaining why he cannot attend the meeting. This could be due to prior commitments, personal reasons, or even disinterest in the meeting. Whatever the reason, Alex should communicate this clearly to Sasha, allowing them to either reschedule or forego the meeting altogether. 3. Hesitate or ponder over the message and weigh out the pros and cons: Upon receiving the message, Alex may not be sure whether to accept or decline the meeting invitation. In such a situation, he might take some time to think about the implications and potential outcomes of the meeting. Alex could discuss his concerns with a close friend, seeking their advice before deciding on an appropriate response. Once he has evaluated the situation and its possible consequences, Alex can respond accordingly to Sasha's message. In conclusion, instead of \\"wait for Alex to write back,\\" a more valid answer might be \\"Alex might choose to accept or decline the invitation, or ponder over his decision before responding to Sasha's message.\\" Keep in mind that the suggested options are just examples and may not cover every possible reaction Alex may have."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Lempel–Ziv (LZ) compression methods are among the most popular algorithms for lossless storage. DEFLATE is a variation on LZ optimized for decompression speed and compression ratio, but compression can be slow. DEFLATE is used in PKZIP, Gzip and PNG. LZW (Lempel–Ziv–Welch) is used in GIF images. Also noteworthy is the LZR (Lempel-Ziv–Renau) algorithm, which serves as the basis for the Zip method.[citation needed] LZ methods use a table-based compression model where table entries are substituted for repeated strings of data. For most LZ methods, this table is generated dynamically from earlier data in the input. The table itself is often Huffman encoded (e.g. SHRI, LZX). Current LZ-based coding schemes that perform well are Brotli and LZX. LZX is used in Microsoft's CAB format.

One continuing controversy of the player selection process is the rule that each team has to have at least one representative on its league's All-Star roster. Supporters of the rule point out that this prevents the large-market teams from totally dominating the squad, and keeps fan and media interest in the game, as fans would not be interested in the game if their team did not have any players involved. Opponents of the rule contend that the purpose of the game is to spotlight Major League Baseball's best players, and that some players from stronger teams are left off the roster in favor of possibly less deserving players from weaker teams. What's the best answer to this question: does every team get a player in the all star game?","completion":"Yes, every team gets at least one player in the All-Star game.

Q:Article: A recent study, while showing a generally positive attitude toward science, also suggests a widespread worry that it may be \\"running out of control\\". This idea is dangerous. Science can be a force for evil as well as for good. Its applications can be channeled either way, depending on our decisions. The decisions we make, personally or collectively, will determine the outcomes of science. But here is a real danger. Science is advancing so fast is so strongly influenced by businesses that we are likely to believe whatever decisions we come to will make little difference. And, rather than fighting for the best possible policies, we may step back and do nothing. Some people go even further. They say that despite the moral and legal objections , whatever is scientifically possible will be done ----somewhere, sometime. They believe that science will get out of control in the end. This belief is dangerous too, because it a fuels sense of hopelessness and discourages them from making efforts to build a safer world. In our interconnected world, the lack of agreement in and of the world of science can lead to the failure to control the use of science. Without a common understanding, the challenges of \\"controlling\\" science in this century will be really tough. Take human cloning for example. Despite the general agreement among scientists on its possible huge impact on traditional moral values, some countries still go ahead with the research and development of its related techniques. The outcomes are hard to predict. Therefore, discussions on how science is applied should be extended far beyond scientific societies. Only through the united efforts of people with hope, can we be fully safe against the misuse of science and can science best serve mankind in the future. Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The development of science mostly lies in people's attitudes.\\"? A:","completion":"No, the answer is not \\"The development of science mostly lies in people's attitudes.\\" The main idea of the passage is that the control and application of science depend on the decisions we make, both individually and collectively. A dangerous belief is that science is running out of control and that our decisions make little difference, which may lead to inaction or hopelessness. The passage emphasizes the importance of a united effort to ensure the safe and responsible use of science for the benefit of mankind."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Output:","completion":"Task Explanation: The task is asking us to determine a suitable location for placing a kennel. A kennel is a structure or shelter for dogs. The process will involve considering different factors like the environment, safety, and comfort of the dogs to find an appropriate spot. Steps to find the answer: 1. Consider the size of the kennel: The dimensions of the kennel and the number of dogs it will house will be important in selecting a suitable location. Ensure the space chosen can accommodate the size of the kennel comfortably. 2. Analyze the environment: Look for a location that is shaded and protected from direct sunlight, heavy rain, and strong winds. This will keep the dogs comfortable in different weather conditions. 3. Ensure safety and security: The chosen location should be secure from potential dangers or threats, such as busy roads or other animals that may harm the dogs. Fencing or barriers should be in place to prevent the dogs from escaping. 4. Ease of access for cleaning and care: Ensure that the location is easily accessible for both the dog owner and the dogs themselves, considering daily tasks such as feeding, cleaning, and playing. 5. Noise and disturbance: Consider placing the kennel in an area where the noise caused by dogs barking will not disturb neighbors or affect the household. 6.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, both of the questions, \\"How do I get rid of a girlfriend?\\" and \\"How can I get rid of a girlfriend?\\" are paraphrases of each other. They both inquire about the necessary steps or methods to take in order to end a romantic relationship with a girlfriend. Although the phrasing is slightly different, the intent behind both questions is the same. Here is a detailed and thoughtful response to this situation: 1. Reflect on your decision: Before taking any course of action, it's essential to think deeply about the reasons you want to end the relationship with your girlfriend. Consider aspects such as compatibility, communication, and overall satisfaction in the relationship. Ensure your decision is well-thought-out and not based on fleeting emotions or a temporary issue that can be resolved. 2. Communicate openly and honestly: One of the most important aspects of any relationship, romantic or otherwise, is honest communication. Arrange a sincere and open conversation with your girlfriend, discussing the reasons you feel the relationship is not working. This will give her the opportunity to share her thoughts and feelings as well, and potentially lead to a mutual understanding. 3. Choose the right time and place: Breakup conversations can be emotional and challenging. Choosing a private and comfortable setting where both of you feel secure is crucial to ensure the discussion remains as calm and respectful as possible. 4. Be empathetic and considerate: Remember that this conversation will likely be very difficult for your girlfriend. Approach the topic with sensitivity, empathy, and kindness, and avoid being harsh or condescending. 5. Be clear and firm: While it's essential to be sensitive, it's also necessary to be clear and direct about your intentions. Avoid using vague language or indecisive statements, as this may only cause confusion and prolong the process. Make it clear you've made a decision, and while you understand it may be painful, it's in the best interest of both parties. 6. Offer support: If it is appropriate and you feel comfortable, offer emotional support to your girlfriend during this process. This may involve remaining available for her to speak with, answering questions she may have, or helping her cope with the breakup. 7. Give each other space: After the conversation, it's important to give both of you some time to process the emotions and reflect on the relationship. This may entail temporarily cutting off contact or spending time apart. It's essential to establish boundaries during this time to allow for healing. 8. Seek support: Ending a relationship can be a draining and emotional experience for both parties involved. Reach out to friends and family, engage in self-care activities, or consider seeking professional help, such as a therapist, to help you navigate this challenging period. In conclusion, ending a relationship with your girlfriend can be a difficult and emotional process. However, by maintaining open and honest communication, showing empathy and understanding, and establishing necessary boundaries, you have the opportunity to make the experience as amicable and respectful as possible. Remember that it's not about \\"getting rid\\" of the person, but rather making a decision that is best for both individuals involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The single best step smokers can take to help with an entire range of health-related conditions is to stop smoking. Cold turkey rarely works, though. Try to quit gradually by using a variety of resources, including nicotine gum and other smoking cessation aids. You can find more info at How to Quit Smoking. Burning calories can also help burn off excess triglycerides in your body to lower levels. In addition, being physically inactive (often combined with being overweight) are 2 things that increase your triglyceride levels.

Translate to Finnish Finnish:","completion":"Ydinräjähteiden testaamisen kieltämisen pitkä historia ulottuu aina 1950-luvulle saakka. Ydinaseiden testauksen kieltämispyrkimykset alkoivat jo 1950-luvulla, jolloin yhdysvallat, Neuvostoliitto ja Yhdistynyt kuningaskunta tekivät suuren määrän ydinkokeita. Aiheesta huolestuneina eri maat alkoivat keskustella mahdollisuudesta kieltää ydinaseiden testaaminen. Vuonna 1958 Yhdysvallat ja Neuvostoliitto sopivat keskeyttävänsä ydinkokeet hetkellisesti, mutta tämä moratorio ei kestänyt kauan, ja molemmat maat jatkoivat testejä pari vuotta myöhemmin. Tämä johti intensiivisiin neuvotteluihin, joiden tavoitteena oli laatia sopimus ydinaseiden testaamisen rajoittamiseksi tai kieltämiseksi. Yksi ensimmäisistä merkittävistä sopimuksista oli Osittainen ydinkoekieltosopimus (tunnetaan myös nimellä Limited Test Ban Treaty tai LTBT) vuodelta 1963. Tämä sopimus kielsi ydinkokeet ilmakehässä, ulkoavaruudessa ja veden alla, mikä vähensi radioaktiivisten saasteiden leviämistä. Tämä sopimus ei kuitenkaan koskenut maanalaisia ydinkokeita, ja ydinasevaltiot jatkoivat tämän tyyppisiä kokeita vuosikymmenien ajan. Ydinkokeiden täydellisestä kieltämisestä neuvoteltiin monia vuosia, ja lopulta vuonna 1996 YK:n yleiskokouksessa hyväksyttiin Ydinkoekieltosopimus (CTBT). Tämä sopimus kieltää kaikki ydinräjähdykset mihin tahansa tarkoitukseen, niin siviili- kuin sotilaskäytössäkin. Sopimuksen tavoitteena on estää ydinaseiden leviäminen, rajoittaa niiden valmistusta ja edistää ydinaseriisuntaa. Vaikka monet maat ovat allekirjoittaneet ja ratifioineet CTBT:n, se ei ole vielä astunut voimaan, koska joitakin ydinasevaltioita, kuten Yhdysvaltoja ja Kiinaa, ei ole ratifioinut sopimusta. Tämä tarkoittaa, että ydinkokeet ovat edelleen teknisesti sallittuja. Tästä huolimatta useimmat maat kunnioittavat sopimuksen henkeä ja jättävät ydinkokeet tekemättä. Ydinkokeiden kieltämisen historia on osoittanut, että valtioiden väliset neuvottelut ja sopimukset voivat edistää ydinaseriisuntaa ja rajoittaa ydinkokeiden haitallisia vaikutuksia. Kuitenkin täydellisen ydinkokeiden kieltämisen saavuttaminen edellyttää kaikkien ydinasevaltioiden sitoutumista yhteiseen tavoitteeseen."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The text states that \\"the faster, longer, and farther the wind blows, the bigger the waves are.\\" Therefore, we can infer that if the waves are getting smaller, as observed by Dan, this would mean that the wind blowing over the water is likely becoming slower, shorter in duration, or not blowing as far. To directly answer the question, Dan can deduce that the wind is blowing softer if he observes the waves getting smaller. This is because a softer wind, which is slower and potentially covering a shorter distance, would lead to smaller waves being formed, whereas a harder wind would create bigger waves.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Which cousin learned more about wolves? The answer is:","completion":"Liam would have learned more about wolves. To understand the rationale behind this answer, let's first break down what a food chain is and how apex predators, grazers, and large herbivores fit into these systems. A food chain represents a sequence of organisms that depend on each other as a source of food. It is a basic concept of ecology, that demonstrates how matter and energy are transferred from one organism to another. It starts from a producer or green plants and ends with apex predators. Apex predators are predators with no predators of their own, residing at the top of their food chain. These animals play crucial roles in maintaining the health, diversity, and abundance of ecosystems around the world. Apex predators include animals like lions, tigers, sharks, and indeed, wolves. On the other hand, grazers and large herbivores are the primary or secondary consumers in a food chain. They include animals that eat plants for their energy and nutritional needs. Examples of such animals include cows, deer, elephants, giraffes, and various kinds of insects. Now, coming back to your question, Liam, who started reading about apex predators, would have inevitably learned about wolves as they fit right into the category of apex predators, being one of the prominent and impactful ones in many ecosystems. Whereas Fox, reading about grazers and large herbivores, would have learned about plant-eating animals and their influences on the ecosystem. While wolves might have been mentioned in the context of the threats or predators that these animals face, the focus of his study would be on herbivores rather than on predators like wolves. Fox would have certainly gained knowledge about the prey species of the wolf or interactions between herbivores and wolves, but the depth of insights pertaining to the wolves would not have been as extensive as that of Liam's. So, in terms of learning about wolves specifically, in their entirety, including their hunting strategies, group dynamics, roles in the ecosystem, and more, Liam is the cousin who would have learned more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Since the 1990s, many regions have broken up the generation and distribution of electric power to provide a more competitive electricity market. While such markets can be abusively manipulated with consequent adverse price and reliability impact to consumers, generally competitive production of electrical energy leads to worthwhile improvements in efficiency. However, transmission and distribution are harder problems since returns on investment are not as easy to find. I am facing a new situation today: Sweden and Norway had taken two different approaches in dealing with their electric power suppliers. Sweden has broken up large companies into many smaller companies. But Norway kept the handful of large electric power suppliers they had intact, and didn't take initiative to increase their numbers. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would companies in Sweden find return on investment harder or easier? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, it can be deduced that companies in Sweden might find return on investment harder compared to companies in Norway. This is due to the fact that Sweden opted to break up their large electric power suppliers into many smaller companies, creating a more competitive electricity market. While competitive production of electrical energy can lead to improvements in efficiency, the challenge of ensuring return on investment increases in the transmission and distribution segments. The presence of numerous smaller companies in Sweden can make it difficult for individual companies to invest heavily in transmission and distribution infrastructure, as the returns on such investments may be comparatively difficult to realize in a fragmented market. On the other hand, Norway has maintained a few large electric power suppliers, which implies that there might be less competition in the market compared to Sweden. As a result, these larger companies may experience an easier time finding returns on their investment, as they have greater control over the transmission and distribution process, and can more easily absorb the costs associated with infrastructure investments. In summary, companies in Sweden might find return on investment harder, as the more competitive market with numerous smaller players makes it more challenging to invest in the transmission and distribution infrastructure needed to ensure long-term profitability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Leon Watson. PUBLISHED:. 08:15 EST, 31 January 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:00 EST, 31 January 2013. Vice President Joe Biden will meet Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov this weekend to try to spark new U.S.-Russia talks over reducing their countries' nuclear arsenals. The meeting will take place in Munich, Germany, before National Security Advisor Tom Donilon travels to Moscow for a second round of talks next month. It comes after years of tension between the U.S. and Russia that has included President Vladimir Putin accusing the. U.S. of meddling in his country's politics. Reduction talks: A Russian Topol-12M mobile nuclear missile is being moved at a strategic forces base near the central Russian city of Yoshkar-Ola. Obama also made unfavourable headlines at his last meeting. with Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in March at a nuclear security summit in South Korea. The President was overheard saying he would have more 'flexibility' to work. with Russia on missile defence after the U.S. presidential election. Seizing on the comments, 43 Republican. senators sent a letter to the president saying any concessions to the. Russians would run counter to U.S. safety and security, and contradict. assurances Obama gave the Senate when he secured ratification of the New. START arms reduction treaty in December 2010. Russian fears of new U.S. missiles at. its doorstep in Europe have also helped to prevent further progress on nuclear. arms reductions after the breakthrough New Start agreement three years ago. In an interview last week, Medvedev explained that Obama was signaling he would have more negotiating power on these subjects, but said that the two countries were still quite far apart. 'Any U.S. President during his second term can take a stronger position and act in a more decisive manner, and that is exactly what Barack meant,' Medvedev said. Talks: Vice President Joe Biden (left), pictured with President Barack Obama (right), will meet Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov to negotiate reducing their countries' nuclear arsenals. Far apart: Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov will meet Biden in Munich, Germany, before National Security Advisor Tom Donilon travels to Moscow for a second round of talks next month. 'But if we talk about the subject. itself, it is extremely difficult, and so far we don't see any. flexibility. There are no easy solutions in terms of anti-missile. defense. There is no flexibility. 'We have not changed our previous. positions. The U.S. has one opinion, and the Russian Federation,. unfortunately, has a different opinion. These positions are not getting. any closer.' Four years ago Biden spoke of the Obama administration's desire 'reset' U.S.-Russian relations after years of deterioration during the George W. Bush presidency. Republicans fear the upcoming meetings with Russian leaders will propose unilateral reductions in U.S. nuclear stockpiles or alterations to U.S. missile-defence plans as an enticement for Russia to sit down for new talks. In February 2011 the U.S. and Russia finalised a landmark arms treaty to limit the nuclear arsenals of the former Cold War foes. The New START treaty limits each side to 1,550 strategic warheads, down from 2,200 and re-established a monitoring system that ended in 2009. The agreement, a cornerstone of Barack Obama's efforts to 'reset' US relations with Russia, came into effect as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton exchanged ratification papers with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov in Munich. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed it as a 'milestone on the road to our ultimate goal: achieving a world free of nuclear weapons'. The seven-year New START treaty was the first major revamping of nuclear disarmament. deals since the late Cold War era. It was approved by the U.S. Senate in. December 2010 after a bruising fight during which Obama pressed strongly for. its passage. Russia ratified the deal the following month. The Cable reported that in a letter to Biden Republican Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Armed Services Strategic Forces Subcommittee,. said: 'Ahead of your unannounced discussions with Russian Foreign. Minister Lavrov this weekend in Munich, and prior to Mr Donilon's. forthcoming February discussions in Moscow, I write seeking your. assurance as to President Obama's plans for future potential U.S. arms. reductions.' Rogers and other Republicans are worried. that the Obama administration may not pursue a new treaty, but instead. strike a deal with Russia that won't have to be approved by Congress. Donilon intends to transmit a personal letter to Putin from Obama 'articulating his plans for further U.S. arms reductions and perhaps even agreements about U.S. missile defenses to entice Russia to the negotiating table,' Rogers wrote, according to The Cable. The State Department's International Security Advisory Board (ISAB), which reports to acting Under Secretary for Arms Control Rose Gottemoeller, issued a report last November spelling out how further nuclear reductions might be achieved, with or without the cooperation of the Senate or the Russians. The ISAB presented options for three scenarios: 'completing the New START Treaty reductions early; working with Russia on transparency and verification of nonstrategic nuclear weapons; and engaging in parallel nuclear arms reductions to levels below New START, if Russia is willing to reciprocate.' 'Unilateral and coordinated reductions can be quicker and less politically costly ... relative to treaties with adversarial negotiations and difficult ratification processes,' the report stated. Administration critics are already preparing to fight any attempt by the White House to push forward with nuclear reductions absent the consent of the Senate. 'Senators should block end-runs around the Constitution's treaty clause,' wrote Bush administration officials John Bolton and John Yoo in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last month. 'An informal agreement would prevent effective congressional scrutiny of the unwise rush to slash the nuclear arsenal, America's ultimate national-security safeguard and a crucial buttress of world peace.' What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is about an important meeting between Joe Biden, who was the Vice President of the United States at that time, and Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia. They met in Munich, Germany to talk about reducing the number of nuclear weapons both the United States and Russia had. This meeting was important because both countries needed to work together to make the world safer by having fewer nuclear weapons. There were some challenges and disagreements between the two countries, but they were trying to find a solution. During this time, people were worried about what decisions would be made and how it would affect their countries' safety."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The introduction of Islam had a significant impact on the architecture and construction techniques in the region. The shift from drystone and other related materials to coral stone, sundried bricks, and limestone is an example of these changes. Limestone, being a durable and widely available construction material, became a popular choice for constructing buildings and monuments that adhered to Islamic architectural principles. It was also commonly used alongside coral stone and sundried bricks. This transition in construction materials is attributed to the influence of Islamic teachings, which emphasized the importance of art and architecture that showcased the beauty and grandeur of the Islamic faith.

Snow falls frequently during the winter, contributed largely by the lake-effect from the Great Salt Lake. The only source of precipitation in the summer is monsoon moisture moving north from the Gulf of California. Summers are hot, frequently reaching above 100 °F (38 °C), while winters are cold and snowy. However, winters are warmer than one would expect at this elevation and latitude, due to the Rocky Mountains to the east and north that usually block powerful polar highs from affecting the state during the winter. Temperatures rarely fall below 0 °F (-18 °C), but frequently stay below freezing. Temperature inversions during winter can lead to thick overnight fog and daytime haze in the valley as cool air, moisture, and pollutants are trapped in the valley by surrounding mountains. Can we conclude that does it snow a lot in salt lake city?","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that it does snow a lot in Salt Lake City. The city experiences a cold and snowy winter, with snowfall being influenced by the lake-effect from the Great Salt Lake. This effect occurs when cold air passes over the warmer waters of the lake, which results in enhanced snowfall in the surrounding areas, such as Salt Lake City. Snowfall occurs frequently during the winter season, which makes the city a popular destination for winter sports enthusiasts. Additionally, the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the east and north serves to protect the city from more extreme winter conditions, which allows for relatively milder temperatures than one might expect at this elevation and latitude. However, it is important to note that Salt Lake City experiences distinct seasonal changes with hot, dry summers and two wet transition periods. Overall, due to the regular snowfall during winter months, it is reasonable to conclude that Salt Lake City experiences a considerable amount of snow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: - Can read either an article or a couple of pages of excerpts - In the given time frame Sentence 2: - Can't finish a page or an article - In the little time available Step 2: Compare the main points in both sentences. Comparing the two sentences, Sentence 1 suggests that the user has enough time to read either an article or a couple of pages of brief excerpts. In contrast, Sentence 2 indicates that the user has very limited time, which is not enough to finish even a single page or an article. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is true given that the first sentence is true. Based on the comparison, it seems that the two sentences describe two different situations, likely with different time frames. If the first sentence is true, then the user has enough time to read an article or a couple of pages of brief excerpts.

Summarize this article: Air purifiers filter the content and the stench of air, erasing the stink of tobacco smoke. This will help you conceal your smoking when indoors. The best air purifiers will have an activated carbon filter. This filter is specially attuned to remove the odor of smoke. If you’re out and about but trying to not get caught smoking indoors, use a personal air filter. These portable devices filter your smoke, scrubbing its scent and toxins. Smoke clings to clothes, curtains, towels, and bedding. Remove these things regularly before they build up a heavy layer of smoke that could out you as an indoor smoker. Smoke particulate can mingle with regular dust and settle on your tables, TVs, and counters. Dust and wipe surfaces regularly to avoid accumulating telltale smoke scent. Don’t forget to wipe down your mirrors and windows. Don’t leave your cigarettes in the toilet or on top of an open trash can. Wrap your cigarette butts in a damp paper towel to ensure they don’t accidentally ignite the trash can, then throw the whole bundle away. If you’re indoors and head off on your own, have a good pretext. For instance, you might smoke when you’re running documents to another part of your workplace. Smoke only during periods of time when you won’t be missed. Smoking indoors when on your way to your lunch break, for instance, is a good option. If you’re in a room with a fan or air conditioner, turn it on. The movement of air can disperse the smoke, making it harder for others to detect. This will reduce the likelihood you’ll get caught.","completion":"The article discusses how to effectively use air purifiers to conceal indoor smoking and minimize the lingering odors. The best air purifiers should have an activated carbon filter, which is specifically designed to remove smoke odors. Personal air filters can be used when on-the-go to filter and scrub the scent and toxins of smoke. It is essential to regularly remove and wash items such as clothes, curtains, and bedding, which can accumulate smoke odor. Cleaning surfaces regularly, including mirrors and windows, can also prevent the buildup of smoke scent. Proper disposal of cigarette butts, having a good pretext when smoking alone indoors, and using a fan or air conditioner to disperse the smoke can also reduce the chances of being caught smoking indoors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rakal, her first officer, was staring pensively at his panel. He was what this was all about. She watched his graceful fingers ending in thick black claws tap out calculations on the panel. His pointed ears swiveled back and forth, catching every sound from the bridge, while his long tail swished to the rhythm of his thoughts. Only those of the Arrallin Insurrection inner team knew he was no common 'beta furry'. His silken fur, which would be tawny golden and striped with jet black bands, was dyed perfectly to a pure black, and his mane trimmed and thinned as to be indistinguishable from the rest of his coat. His eyes had been treated and darkened to a rich purple to disguise the brilliant golden yellow color that would mark him as an Alpha Arrallin, and leader of his hive. Right now, he looked like an overgrown wolf who'd learned touch-typing. The scout ship re-emerged from the hole - a brilliant speck emerging from a sphere of velvety blackness.

This informs us that we are discussing the actions of a human (or person) in this context. 2. \\"is looking at\\": This phrase signifies that the woman is visually observing or taking interest in something. It indicates that her gaze is directed towards particular objects. 3. \\"a big dog and clothes\\": These are the objects that have captured the woman's attention – a large canine and articles of clothing. The fact that she is looking at these specific objects implies that she may potentially have an interest in them, either for herself or as a potential gift for someone else. 4. \\"in a store window\\": This final part of the statement is crucial in connecting the elements to define the activity as \\"window shopping.\\" A store window is a glass display at the front of a retail shop where retailers showcase their products to attract customers and encourage them to enter their store.

However, her peaceful life takes a sharp turn as she becomes entangled in a centuries-old deadly conflict. Genre: Adventure, Thriller, Mystery Plot: In 19th century England, academic circles are buzzing with intrigue about a newly discovered manuscript filled with cryptic references to a vampiric bloodline. Dr. Julia Ashworth, a highly respected historian and linguist, is persuaded by a prominent museum curator to join a team of experts to crack the code and unearth the secrets hidden within it. Reluctantly, Julia sets sail to the Carpathian Mountains, where the ancient manuscript was discovered. Upon her arrival, she befriends the locals, who share their knowledge about an old castle that harbors the unsettling remains of a mysterious noble family. Julia's curiosity gets the better of her, and she decides to investigate the castle alone. As she unearths clues that seem to corroborate the legends of ancient vampires, Julia encounters the enigmatic Countess Valeria Radescu, who warns her to abandon her quest for the truth. Ignoring the countess's warning, Julia continues her research, inadvertently exposing her fellow experts to the same supernatural threat that she herself has stumbled upon. One by one, her colleagues start to succumb to the dark forces surrounding them. As she digs deeper into the mystery, Julia learns that Countess Valeria is actually the last descendant of a fearsome bloodline of vampires, who was cursed by an ancient sorcerer. The curse forces her to protect the secrets of her lineage and prevent anyone from discovering the truth that could break the curse and free her from her eternal agony. Realizing that she might be the key to the Countess' salvation and the freedom of her team, Julia must choose between saving herself and her friends, or returning to England empty-handed, knowing that she has unearthed a secret that could change the course of history. Determined to break the curse and save her colleagues, she collaborates with the Countess in a race against time and ancient forces. At great personal risk, Julia manages to crack the code and unveil the means of breaking the curse just as her colleagues succumb to vampirism. With no other alternatives, Julia orchestrates a daring plan to break the curse and defeat the ancient sorcerer, who has returned to claim his dark legacy. As daylight fast approaches, she sacrifices herself and uses the knowledge from the manuscript to free Countess Valeria and her colleagues from a nightmarish existence. In the final moments, Julia remembers the curator's plea for her to return with a story. But a bittersweet epilogue reveals that Julia refused to return to England, embracing her destiny as the champion and eternal guardian of the bloodline's haunted past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And while it would not be a far stretch of the imagination to assume an 8-year-old's cooking show would be filled with dishes like pizza and burgers, Arthur's show actually features recipes like fruit salad a la creme de passion fruit and filet mignon . The idea to record Arthur's cooking adventures on YouTube was rooted in the young chef's leukemia diagnosis in August 2013.Treatment and recovery for the cancer left the young boy in the hospital for the second half of the year and Aruthur was even forced to spend Christmas Eve in the emergency room of So Paulo's A.C. Camargo Cancer Center. That's when his family--father Renato Gonzaga and stepmother Priscila Inserra--decided that Arthur should create something positive that would distract him from his health. The videos, which are filmed in the kitchen of a friend of the family, are in Portuguese. They show Arthur walking the viewers through a step-by-step process of the entire recipe--from preparation to cooking. Occasionally, viewers can see Arthur's father serving as his son's _ , passing ingredients and following his lead. Fluent in Portuguese or not, viewers can immediately notice Arthur's optimistic and friendly personality. It is perhaps these qualities that have given the young rising Internet star almost 5,000 likes on his Facebook Fan Page. There are currently three videos on YouTube and according to his most recent Facebook post, the young boy will be taking suggestions for his next video. Fortunately, according to what Inserra told TheHuffingtonPost, Arthur is responding well to his treatments and is on his path to recovery. \\"The secret of life is to let it take you, to have fun and to know how to turn lemons into lemonade ,\\" wrote her family, fittingly, on their most recent Facebook post.

The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. Paragraph: Mike is studying for his physics exam. He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D? The answer is:","completion":"Scenario D would most likely be used in the everyday world, as it uses the pressure unit psi (pounds per square inch), which is more commonly applied in everyday scenarios such as tire pressure or water pressure. Scenario A, which uses Pascals, is an SI unit but is less commonly used in daily life situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: George Soros: Brexit Would Cause \\"Precipitous\\" Plunge for Pound George Soros, the billionaire who earned fame by betting against the pound in 1992, said that a British vote on Thursday to leave the European Union would trigger a bigger and more disruptive sterling devaluation than the fall on Black Wednesday. Soros used Quantum Fund in 1992 to bet successfully that sterling was overvalued against the Deutsche Mark, forcing then-Prime Minister John Major to pull the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Soros, in an opinion piece in the Guardian newspaper, said that in the event of a British exit, or Brexit, the pound would fall by at least 15%, and possibly more than 20%, to below 1.15 from its current level of around 1.46. “The value of the pound would decline precipitously. It would also have an immediate and dramatic impact on financial markets, investment, prices and jobs,” Soros, who is 85, said in the Guardian. “I would expect this devaluation to be bigger and also more disruptive than the 15% devaluation that occurred in September 1992, when I was fortunate enough to make a substantial profit for my hedge fund investors.” Soros, ranked as the world’s 23rd richest person by Forbes magazine with a fortune of 24.9 billion, said the Bank of England would not cut rates after a British exit and that there would be few monetary policy tools left to ease a recession or a fall in British house prices. He also pointed to the “very large” current account deficit in the United Kingdom and said a post-Brexit devaluation would be unlikely to improve manufacturing as trading conditions would be too uncertain to undertake new investments or hire workers. Hungarian-born Soros said the scale of the sterling devaluation would compare with 1967, when then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson devalued the pound to 2.40 from 2.80. Speculators, Soros said, would be eager to exploit a Brexit situation to profit. “Today, there are speculative forces in the markets much bigger and more powerful. And they will be eager to exploit any miscalculations by the British government or British voters,” Soros said. “Brexit would make some people very rich—but most voters considerably poorer,” Soros said. Members of Britain’s Leave campaign say some bankers, big companies and politicians are trying to scare British voters with overblown warnings about the financial and economic impact of a Brexit. Opponents of EU membership say Britain could prosper if it cut itself free from what they portray as a doomed German-dominated project in excessive debt-funded welfare spending. The world’s biggest banks including Citi and Goldman Sachs will draft in senior traders to work through the night following Britain’s referendum on EU membership, set to be among the most volatile 24 hours for markets in a quarter of a century. A vote to leave the European Union on June 23 would spook investors by undermining post-World War Two attempts at European integration and placing a question mark over the future of the United Kingdom and its 2.9 trillion economy. Citi, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds are among those banks planning to have senior staff and traders working or on call in London as results start to dribble in after polls close Thursday evening, according to sources. “British voters are now grossly underestimating the true costs of Brexit,” Soros said. “Too many believe that a vote to leave the EU will have no effect on their personal financial position. This is wishful thinking.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Answer the following question: Information: - Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease affecting humans and other animals caused by parasitic protozoans (a group of single-celled microorganisms) belonging to the \\"Plasmodium\\" type. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. The disease is most commonly transmitted by an infected female \\"Anopheles\\" mosquito. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of \\"Plasmodium\\" can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by \\"P. falciparum\\" because \\"P. vivax\\", \\"P. ovale\\", and \\"P. malariae\\" generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species \\"P. knowlesi\\" rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity. The risk of disease can be reduced by preventing mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets and insect repellents, or with mosquito control measures such as spraying insecticides and draining standing water. Several medications are available to prevent malaria in travellers to areas where the disease is common. Occasional doses of the combination medication sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine are recommended in infants and after the first trimester of pregnancy in areas with high rates of malaria. Despite a need, no... - Mosquito control manages the population of mosquitoes to reduce their damage to human health, economies, and enjoyment. Mosquito control is a vital public-health practice throughout the world and especially in the tropics because mosquitoes spread many diseases, such as malaria and the Zika virus. - Plasmodium , commonly known as the malaria parasite , is a large genus of parasitic protozoa . As with some other genera of clinically important microorganisms , the genus name also yields a common noun ; thus species of the genus are known as plasmodia . Infection with plasmodia is known as malaria , a deadly disease widespread in the tropics . The parasite always has two hosts in its life cycle : a Dipteran insect host and a vertebrate host . Sexual reproduction always occurs in the insect definitive host ( also known as the disease vector ) . The life - cycle is complex , involving a sequence of different stages both in the vector and the vertebrate host . These stages include sporozoites , which are injected by the insect vector into the vertebrate host 's blood ; latent hypnozoites , which may rest undetected in the liver for up to 30 years ; merosomes and merozoites , which infect the red cells ( erythrocytes ) of the blood ; trophozoites , which grow in the red cells , and schizonts , which divide in red blood cells . Schizonts produce merozoites , which leave to infect more red cells . The sexual forms , gametocytes , are taken up by other insect hosts during feeding . Gametocytes develop into gametes in the insect midgut , and then fertilize each other to form motile zygotes , which escape the gut . Zygotes grow into new sporozoites , which move to the insect 's salivary glands . Sporozoites are injected into vertebrate hosts during insect feeding , thus completing the cycle of infection . The genus Plasmodium was first described in 1885 . It now contains about 200 species divided into several subgenera ; as of 2006 the taxonomy was shifting , and species from other genera are likely to be added to Plasmodium . At least ten species infect humans ; other species infect other animals , including birds , reptiles and rodents , while 29 species infect non-human primates . The parasite is thought to have originated from Dinoflagellates , photosynthetic protozoa . The most common forms of human malaria are... - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Artemisinin, also known as qinghao su, and its semi-synthetic derivatives are a group of drugs that possess the most rapid action of all current drugs against \\"Plasmodium falciparum\\" malaria. It was discovered by Tu Youyou, a Chinese scientist, who was awarded half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Medicine for her discovery. Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies, ACTs) are now standard treatment worldwide for \\"P. falciparum\\" malaria. Artemisinin is isolated from the plant \\"Artemisia annua\\", sweet wormwood, an herb employed in Chinese traditional medicine. A precursor compound can be produced using genetically engineered yeast. - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - Anopheles (Greek anofelís: \\"useless\\") is a genus of mosquito first described and named by J. W. Meigen in 1818. About 460 species are recognised; while over 100 can transmit human malaria, only 3040 commonly transmit parasites of the genus \\"Plasmodium\\", which cause malaria in humans in endemic areas. \\"Anopheles gambiae\\" is one of the best known, because of its predominant role in the transmission of the most dangerous malaria parasite species (to humans) \\"Plasmodium falciparum\\". - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The liver is a vital organ of vertebrates and some other animals. In the human, it is located in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen, below the diaphragm. The liver has a wide range of functions, including detoxification of various metabolites, protein synthesis, and the production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. - An infant (from the Latin word \\"infans\\", meaning \\"unable to speak\\" or \\"speechless\\") is the more formal or specialised synonym for \\"baby\\", the very young offspring of a human or other animal. - Saliva is a watery substance formed in the mouths of animals, secreted by the salivary glands. Human saliva comprises 99.5% mostly water, plus electrolytes, mucus, white blood cells, epithelial cells (which can be used to extract DNA), glycoproteins, enzymes (such as amylase and lipase), antimicrobial agents such as secretory IgA and lysozyme. The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. These enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices, thus protecting teeth from bacterial decay. Furthermore, saliva serves a lubricative function, wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity from desiccation.

News article: Twitter Goes to Town on Amercia Mitt Romney launched an official iPhone app Tuesday night — only to find that it came with one glaring, humiliating oversight for his campaign. Here's how the free app works: You take a photo, then are able to lay one of 14 \\"I'm With Mitt\\" banners over the image. The banners shout slogans such as \\"I'm a Mom for Mitt.\\" Then you can post the photo directly to Facebook or Twitter, or email it to a friend. The friend then receives a message reading: “I’m with Mitt Romney in 2012. And here’s a photo showing my support. Check it out!” The problem? One of the 14 options reads, in fact, \\"A Better Amercia.\\" Yes, Amercia. A-M-E-R-C-I-A. Just a couple hours after the app was officially announced, the Twittersphere and online peanut gallery were already having a field day with the editorial oversight. Obama supporters, media and general snarkmeisters reveled in taking photos with the glitchy app and inserting \\"Amercia\\" into some of Romney's most memorable campaign quotes. UPDATE: Mitt Romney’s “With Mitt” iPhone app no longer includes the “Amercia” typo. Tuesday was a big night for Romney, and the app's release was intended in part to help celebrate his likely capture of the Republican presidential nomination after the Texas primary. Zac Moffatt, Romney's digital director, told Mashable Thursday afternoon that the app was meant to be a simple way for Romney backers to show their pride as the candidate took a big symbolic step toward the White House. “We thought this would be a fun, easy way to showcase support,” Moffatt said.

Use Sharpie ink as an alternative.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Fun and Easy Art Project: Mixing Alcohol-Based Ink and Water Hey kids, today we are going to talk about a super fun and simple art project that you can do with the help of an adult! We will be mixing alcohol-based ink and water to create awesome spray paint. You can even use ink from a Sharpie marker as an alternative. Are you ready? Let's go! To start this exciting art project, we will need a few things: 1. Alcohol-based ink or Sharpie marker ink. 2. Water. 3. A spray bottle. 4. An adult to help you. Step 1: Preparing the ink First, we need to get the ink ready. If you are using alcohol-based ink, ask an adult to help you measure the right amount. If you are using Sharpie marker ink, you can ask the adult to take the ink out of the marker by opening it carefully. It's super important to have an adult help you with this part, as the ink can be quite messy! Step 2: Measuring the water Now, it's time to measure the water. To create the perfect mixture for our spray paint, we need equal amounts of ink and water. This means, if we have one cup of ink, we will need one cup of water too! Ask the adult to help you pour the water into a measuring cup. Step 3: Mixing the ink and water With the help of the adult, pour your measured ink and water into the spray bottle. Make sure the spray bottle is empty and clean before you pour the mixture in. Now, you have a 1:1 ratio of ink and water, which means they are the same amount and mixed together nicely! Step 4: Creating your masterpiece! Now comes the most fun part: using your new spray paint to make amazing art! You can spray the mixture on paper, fabric, or other surfaces to create cool patterns and designs. Remember to always have an adult close by when using the spray bottle and avoid spraying it in your eyes or mouth. And there you have it, kids! A super simple and fun art project using a 1:1 ratio of alcohol-based ink and water in a spray bottle. Get ready to create beautiful and colorful masterpieces using your new spray paint.

Write highlights for this article: The mission to produce the world’s first 1,000mph (1,600km/h) car has been given a boost - or more accurately thrust - with the installation of a state-of-the-art jet engine. A team of five engineers spent eight hours fitting the EJ200 engine to the upper and lower chassis of the supersonic Bloodhound car. Driver Andy Green, 51, is hoping to break the world land speed record when he tests the £10 million rocket-powered vehicle next year. The mission to produce the world’s first 1,000mph (1,600km/h) car has been given a boost - or more accurately thrust - with the installation of a state-of-the-art jet engine. A team of five engineers spent eight hours fitting the EJ200 jet engine to the upper and lower chassis of the supersonic Bloodhound car (pictured) The engine, which is normally found powering a Eurofighter Typhoon, weighs a tonne and produces 20,000lbs (90kN) - or nine tonnes of thrust. It was fitted at the Bloodhound technical centre in Avonmouth, near Bristol. The upper chassis is made of strong, but lightweight aluminium, onto which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets. The SSC stands for ‘SuperSonic Car’. The vehicle has four wheels and is powered by both the newly-fitted jet engine and a rocket. It is set to travel at 1,000mph (1,600km/h). The slender body, 44 feet (14 metres) long, keeps the entire vehicle aerodynamic. It weighs just over seven tonnes and the engines will produce more than 135,000 horsepower. That’s more than six times the power of all the cars on a Formula 1 starting grid put together. In the coming years the vehicle will begin test runs at lower speeds before attempting to set a new land speed record. The current land speed record stands at 763.035mph (1,227.985km/h), set by former RAF pilot Andy Green - who will also drive the Bloodhound - back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. The Bloodhound will beat this record by some distance if it is successful. The lower chassis, below the jet, is made of aluminium and steel, and houses the Nammo hybrid rocket. The two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power, or the equivalent to 180 Formula 1 cars. The pencil-shaped car will be 44ft (13.4m) long, 6ft (183cm) in diameter, and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed. Chief engineer Mark Chapman said: ‘This is a fantastic moment in the project. ‘It’s great to see the jet engine fitted, it validates the many years of hard work by our team of motor sport and aerospace engineers.’ The project is on course for the finished car to roll out for low speed testing at up to 200mph (321km/h) at Newquay’s Aerohub next summer. The team will then head to South Africa and attempt to break the 1,000mph barrier on a purpose-built 12-mile track in the desert in 2015 and 2016. During the record-chasing run, Bloodhound will cover 12 miles (19km) in two minutes, exerting an acceleration force of almost 2G, and peak deceleration force of 3G on the driver. The current land speed record stands at 763.035mph (1,227.985km/h), set by former RAF pilot Andy Green - who will also drive the Bloodhound - back in 1997 in the ThrustSSC. The pencil-shaped car (concept pictured) will be 44ft (13.4m) long, 6ft (183cm) in diameter and weigh 7.5 tonnes when completed. The upper chassis is made of strong, but lightweight aluminium to which titanium stringers and titanium skin will be fixed using glue and 1,400 aircraft specification rivets. The lower chassis, below the jet (pictured), is made of aluminium and steel, and houses the Nammo hybrid rocket. The two power plants together produce 135,000 thrust horse power, or the equivalent to 180 F1 cars. Earlier this year, designers of the supersonic car revealed the vehicle’s futuristic cockpit. It has been made from five different types of carbon fibre weave, and two different resins. It has taken more than 10,000 hours to design and manufacture in total. The team behind the Bloodhound SSC also revealed how they intend to slow it from 1,000mph (1,600km/h) to zero. After the car reaches its top speed, air brakes and parachutes slow it to 160mph (260km/h). Breaking to this speed is done at a constant 3G deceleration - equivalent to going from 60mph (95km/h) in a normal car to zero in just one second - for 20 seconds. At this speed the cars wheels are still spinning 10,000 times per minute. Attempts to use carbon rotors from a jet fighter in the form of car-like disc brakes shattered at speeds of just half this, so the team needed a new approach. Instead, they switched to steel rotors. In tests, these could withstand temperatures of up to 850°C (1,560°F), and be used again. The next step will be to test these brakes out at the full 10,000rpm that will be experienced. Sandwiched between the layers of carbon fibre are three different thicknesses of aluminium honeycomb core, which provide additional strength. At its thickest point the material is made up of 13 layers, but measures just 0.9-inches (24mm) thick. The cockpit structure weighs 441lbs (200kg) and bolts directly to the metallic rear chassis carrying the jet, rocket and racing car engine. It has to be strong as this front section will have to endure peak aerodynamic loads of up to three tonnes per square metre at 1,000mph (1,609kph), as well the considerable forces generated by the front wheels and suspension. It will also carry ballistic armour to protect Wing Commander Green should a stone be thrown up by the front wheels at very high speeds. The cockpit is positioned in front of three loud motors - the jet, a cluster of hybrid rockets and the racing car engine that drives the rocket’s oxidiser pump, which are expected to generate a noise level estimated at 140 decibels - the equivalent to a shotgun blast. Wing Commander Green will wear a specially made in-ear communications system to protect his hearing and to ensure that he can communicate with mission control.

David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience. The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor. For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there.

The user indicates that they have been in South Africa for over a month and are yet to write a blog about their experiences. They state that they intend to start writing, however, it seems like they may be overwhelmed by the amount of experiences and information accumulated over this period, which could make writing the blog a daunting task. The expression \\"Now the question is where do is start ... ?\\" suggests a sense of confusion or feeling overwhelmed about the starting point for the blog due to likely numerous experiences and observations. Thus, it can be assumed that the blogger might require some time to organize thoughts and insights, decide on the structure of the post, and then to write it. Moreover, their statement, \\"I 'll try ( emphasis try ) to keep this short\\", reflects their intention but also uncertainty in fully adhering to it. This could be because the experiences they've had might be so broad and variant that it might be challenging to condense them into a short blog post. Hence, the length and nature of the blog post might evolve in the writing process, causing potential delays in completion.

Write a title for this article: Rep. Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, presents his budget plan Tuesday. Editor's note: David Rothkopf is CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group, publishers of Foreign Policy magazine, and a visiting scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. (CNN) -- For most Americans, the budget debate in Washington is reaching dog-whistle pitch, a tone that only partisans can hear. Which, as far as I am concerned, is a mercy. Paul Ryan offered his budget on Tuesday. Let's do give him props for making the effort and all. The vast majority of his colleagues are potted plants on this front, reading talking points, sometimes banging the table and doing precious little else. But what Ryan calls a budget is what any CEO would call a firing offense. It uses some numbers and some words that appear in real budgets. But it neglects some other key elements ... like arithmetic or the truth or a greater economic purpose. The Ryan budget depends entirely on unspecified tax reforms and the replacement of revenues he doesn't care for (such as those associated with Obamacare) with others he doesn't care to actually define or describe. The rigorous, widely respected Center on Budget and Policy Priorities slammed the exercise, taking Ryan to task for failing to live up to his billing as the guy courageous enough to put his ideas out there. It wrote, \\"Is it courageous to propose tax cuts but not identify a single tax expenditure to rein in? Is it courageous to target your deepest cuts on the poorest Americans, who vote in lower numbers and provide little in campaign contributions? Is it courageous to camouflage hundreds of billions in cuts for the poor and disadvantaged in broad budget categories without identifying the programmatic cuts, so that analysts, journalists, and other policymakers can't identify the specific cuts and assess their impacts?\\" Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, we have a real sign of the End Times: Senate Democrats have actually come out with a budget for the first time since the iPad was invented. There are children in school, reading, who were born since their last budget. Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray unveiled it Wednesday. Her budget is as partisan as Ryan's and offers little common ground with his on controversial issues. It calls for 1.85 trillion in deficit reduction through the end of the decade, almost 1 trillion of it from new revenues. Ryan calls the divergent plans the beginning of a process. The question is where that process will lead. Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at . We welcome your ideas and comments. Early next month, the president will submit the budget he was supposed to have sent to the Hill in February. There it will sit, because it too is just a negotiating ploy, an opening bid. These compilations of charts and data are not budgets at all. They are just props in the Budget Follies of 2013. Not one of the long-term visions sketched out in these plans will actually be realized. There will be no serious discussion or honest debate about enacting meaningful tax reform, rethinking defense spending or remaking our entitlement system for a world in which people generally live longer and in which government resources are stretched. But, frankly, these aren't even the most critical issues we should be addressing. The budget is important. Cutting our deficits matters. But in a country in which corporate profits and the stock market are at record highs but in which jobs are being created far too slowly and median incomes are sagging, we have far more basic issues to grapple with. The United States is like a business whose model for making revenue is failing, trying to save itself by cutting down on travel expenditures and the cost of making photocopies. Sure, we shouldn't overspend. But if we don't figure out what business we're in -- what new industries will create tomorrow's jobs, what kind of new workers we'll need, what kind of infrastructure we must have to be competitive and attract investment -- our deficit problems will seem minor compared with our social and political concerns. Our most important national discussion should not be about spending but about investment. We need to recognize that some federal programs help grow the economy and weigh the return on investment we will get from these and which are essential to growing the new industries that will be the employers of tomorrow ... and will provide the growth that is the only real solution to our debt issues. The Ryan budget cuts transportation spending in a country that has neglected its highways and bridges for over half a century. It doesn't plan for the infrastructure spending we will need to respond to the consequences of climate change (like hurricane relief) or anticipate the investment we could make to avoid such problems in the first place. It doesn't discuss how to expand information technology and next-generation energy infrastructure as we must. Perhaps the Senate budget or the president's will be wiser about investing -- although neither is likely to think big enough about transport spending or an infrastructure bank or, better, a network of regional infrastructure finance institutions. What seems more likely, sadly, is more hollow gestures, scurrying to avoid artificial deadlines and visionless crisis management. Not one leader has emerged in Washington who is providing anything truly different that cuts to the core questions we face or rises to the true challenge of our times. Which leaves us but one consolation. Washington has grown so shrill that most of this empty debate will be heard only by our dogs. Pity the dogs. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

We have record rainfall during 24 hours in Lahore, breaking previous one day record by more than 60%. Our drainage system is pathetic. Other systems such as telephone, electricity, cable etc. are no better. Poor planning has further been aggravated by extremely mismanaged maintenance and operational bugs. This morning, when I was out for our fajr (morning prayers) in masjid, a neighbor told me that the pole laden with electricity meters was under fire. After that he buzzed off for complaint office. When I returned after prayers, I saw fire reaching cable part after meter; one meter had caught fire and other meters (including ours) was in danger of catching fire. It was still dark. I waited for someone to come out. No one appeared. I came inside and told my wife about and went again out to see if I could find someone to go about extinguishing fire. IT WAS DAM RISKY AS DIGGING WAS DONE BY TELEPHONE COMPANY AND RAINS HAD MADE A MESS ON OUR STREET. No one was seen. My wife came out; brought hose pipe. I managed to use it as water gun and there was some post-extinguishing sparking; fire was put out. I want to add here that hose pipe should only be used when someone knows how to send bursts of water so that electric current cannot build a circuit.

Given the temperature stays constant, will the volume of the air inside the compressor increase or decrease? Hint: Robert Boyle (1627-1691), an English chemist, is widely considered to be one of the founders of the modern experimental science of chemistry. He discovered that doubling the pressure of an enclosed sample of gas while keeping its temperature constant caused the volume of the gas to be reduced by half. Boyle’s law states that the volume of a given mass of gas varies inversely with the pressure when the temperature is kept constant. An inverse relationship is described in this way.

FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent.

Bobby is a plumber who is henpecked by his wife and daughters while trying to follow his dream of writing a plumbing how-to book. Dudley is a computer geek who seeks to find a woman in his life. Their one collective hobby had always been to ride together on motorcycles around the city, though after college that happened less and less often.When Woody finds out that his marriage is ending in divorce and that he's bankrupt, he suggests they embark on a cross-country road trip west on their bikes to seek adventure. After some hesitation from the other three, the four agree to the trip and set off on their Harley-Davidsons.The road trip is filled with humorous moments, such as sleeping close together scantily dressed and being found by a policeman (John C. McGinley) who tells them they can be charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, but it turns out that he is only teasing: he is actually jealous. Later, when the four go to a small lake, a family on a picnic joins them in the water only to realize the four men are naked. The policeman appears again; he also undresses and joins the four men, who quickly leave.The fun ends when the four stop at a bar and stumble onto a real motorcycle gang called the Del Fuegos.

Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah. Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, \\"He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.\\" Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane. During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \\"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\\" From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \\"born again\\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \\"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.\\" In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, \\"Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind.\\"When it was asked of Dylan in a 1986 press conference in Australia \\"How much do you feel you are a vessel, a medium for a higher power, for God, that it [the music] flows through you... for Him?\\" Dylan replied, \\"Well I feel that way about most of the stuff that I do.\\"In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek: Here's the thing with me and the religious thing.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. The Deakin University experiment probably lasted: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B. A few minutes C. A few days D.

As Russia reels from the worst drought in nearly 40 years, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has announced a temporary ban on grain exports. \\"I think it is expedient to temporarily ban exports of grain and grain products from Russia,\\" Putin said in a government meeting Thursday. Putin spokesman Dmitry Pskov confirmed to CNN that the ban would be from August 15 through December 1. Russia is the world's third largest wheat exporter, but is facing the possibility of wheat shortages. The drought has forced the country's Agriculture Ministry to slash its grain forecast from 90 million tons to between 70 and 75 million tons. Grain prices have been rising everywhere recently, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's Wheat Year in Review Report for 2008-2009, the most recent available. Because adverse weather lowered wheat production in 2007-2008, there was a global price spike that year, the report states. Many wheat-producing countries harvested large amounts of wheat in 2008, taking advantage of the record-high prices and good weather. After a sharp drop in monthly prices in October 2008, wheat prices continued rising. The all-wheat season average hit a record-high of 6.78 per bushel in the United States in 2009. The world set a record at 25.1 billion bushels of wheat produced that year. \\"U.S. and world wheat prices soared,\\" the report states. Eventually, the demand for U.S. wheat began exceeding the supply, further contributing to high costs. CNN's Emily Evans contributed to this report.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What was the original name of the place that was named Hotel Frances in 1925? from the following article ? As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him. The answer is:","completion":"The original name of the place that was named Hotel Frances in 1925 was Hotel Monte Ne.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Dan studied two islands. Loon island had a very stable environment, and there weren't many diverse species of plants and animals. Wolf island displayed lots of evidence for natural selection, and had a large variety of species inhabiting it. Which island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits? The answer is:","completion":"Wolf Island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits. This is because Wolf Island had a large variety of species, which implies that there have been ample opportunities for different organisms to evolve and adapt to changing environmental conditions. As natural selection plays a significant role in the development of these beneficial heritable traits, it is evident that the diverse range of species on Wolf Island provides a wealth of examples of favorable characteristics being passed down through generations. In contrast, Loon Island had a very stable environment and fewer diverse species of plants and animals. This suggests that the organisms living there have not experienced the same level of environmental pressure as those on Wolf Island, leading to a lower chance for evolution through natural selection. With fewer selective pressures, there would be less opportunity for the development of beneficial heritable traits that enable the organisms to better survive and reproduce. Moreover, the high diversity of species on Wolf Island signifies that these species have likely gone through various adaptations to inhabit different ecological niches, exhibiting a broader range of beneficial traits that help them thrive in their respective environments. On the other hand, the organisms on Loon Island, with their less varied ecosystem, may not have needed to adapt as significantly and therefore would not be as likely to display as many beneficial heritable traits. In conclusion, when comparing Loon Island and Wolf Island, it is clear that the animals on Wolf Island would display more beneficial heritable traits due to the higher diversity of species present, the evidence for natural selection in action, and the varied environmental pressures that these organisms have experienced over time. This adaptation process on Wolf Island ultimately leads to a multitude of beneficial traits that enhance the survival and reproductive success of its diverse species."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2012 the research organization Sreda published Arena Atlas, a detailed enumeration of religious populations and nationalities in Russia, based on a large-sample country-wide survey. They found that 46.8% of Russians declared themselves Christians (including 41% Russian Orthodox, 1.5% simply Orthodox or members of non-Russian Orthodox churches, 4.1% unaffiliated Christians, and less than 1% for both Catholic and Protestant), while 25% were spiritual but not religious, 13% were atheists, 6.5% were Muslims, 1.2% were followers of \\"traditional religions honoring gods and ancestors\\" (including Rodnovery, Tengrism and other ethnic religions), and 0.5% were Tibetan Buddhism. However, later that year, the Levada Center estimated that 76% of Russians were Christians, and in June 2013, the Public Opinion Foundation estimated that 65% of the population was Christian. These findings are in line with Pew Research Centers 2011 estimate that 73.6% of Russians were Christians, with Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VCIOM)s 2010 survey (~77% Christian), and with Ipsos MORIs 2011 survey (69%).

Write a summary based on this article: British woman dies after Everest trek October is peak trekking season in Nepal A British woman has died after being taken ill while on a trekking trip in Nepal's Everest region, police say. The 49-year-old was reportedly found dead in her hotel room after complaining of breathing difficulties. Local police told the AFP news agency she had just returned from a trek to Everest base camp, at 5,364m (17,700ft) above sea level, with her daughter. The Foreign Office said it was notified of the death and was providing consular assistance to the family. Police spokesman Purushottam Silwal said the pair were on their way to Nepal's capital Kathmandu when the woman experienced trouble breathing and decided to stop for a night at a hotel in Khumjung. He suggested the death could be down to altitude sickness, which leads to headaches, fatigue and dizziness and occurs when people ascend heights too quickly. The woman's body has been airlifted to Kathmandu for a post-mortem examination, he added. October is peak trekking season in Nepal, which is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains. ||||| AFP / Robert Kay A British woman died after returning from a trip to Everest base camp with her daughter A British woman on a trekking trip in Nepal's Everest region was found dead in her hotel room after complaining of respiratory problems, local police said Monday. The 49-year-old and her daughter were returning from a trip to Everest base camp, located at 5,364 metres (17,700 feet), when she experienced trouble breathing and stopped for a night at a hotel in Khumjung, en route to the capital Kathmandu. \\"She possibly died of altitude sickness,\\" local police official, Purushottam Silwal, told AFP. \\"Her body was airlifted to Kathmandu for a post-mortem,\\" Silwal said. Altitude sickness strikes when people ascend heights too quickly, as the decreased atmosphere pressure causes headaches, fatigue and dizziness. The incident follows the death of a Japanese climber last month, who slipped and fell during an ascent of Mount Manaslu, the world's eighth-highest peak. October is peak trekking season in the Himalayan nation, which is home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains.

The issues are similar to those at Oxgangs Primary in Edinburgh, where a wall collapsed in January. That led to 17 schools in the city being closed before the summer holidays over safety fears. Responding to some of the new evidence, a leading architect told the BBC: \\"In my view, this is malpractice.\\" About 7,600 primary and secondary school children in the capital were affected when the Edinburgh schools, which were all built or refurbished as part of the same public private partnership (PPP) scheme, were closed suddenly in April this year. The problems - with wall and header ties, used to hold exterior and interior walls together and attach them to the rest of the building - first became apparent when part of a wall at Oxgangs fell during stormy weather. Safety inspections were ordered and pupils were bussed to other schools across the city while repairs were carried out. Edinburgh City Council's investigation into what happened is due to begin later this week. The chief executive has told the BBC that the inquiry may reveal nationwide issues with this kind of building. 30 Schools affected across Scotland 17 closed in Edinburgh 13 others in East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, Stirlingshire and South Lanarkshire identified 62 walls ties replaced at nine schools in South Lanarkshire Now the BBC has also learned that similar problems with wall and header ties have been uncovered at 13 other schools across Scotland. Repairs have been undertaken in South Lanarkshire, Stirlingshire, Glasgow and East Renfrewshire in the last five years. Images of St Ninian's High School in East Renfrewshire, obtained under Freedom of Information legislation, show the inside of cavity walls where some metal ties are dangling in mid-air instead of holding the outside wall to the inside wall. Other wall ties were not properly embedded because the joints in the walls were not aligned. The council had to undertake a number of repairs to the school, costing more than Â£870,000. \\"The way some of these things are done is very worrying indeed,\\" said Prof Alan Dunlop, Master Architect and lecturer with Robert Gordon University. \\"I'm also concerned and shocked that this is something that happened in 2010 and we do not know anything at all about it.\\" \\"I would suggest that it not only contravenes what would be standard practice. In my view this is malpractice,\\" he added. East Renfrewshire Council said it did not inform parents of the issue because \\"at no time was there a health and safety risk to pupils, staff or visitors\\". It said the matter was discussed \\"openly\\" at a full council meeting in May 2013. A spokeswoman added: \\"The expert structural reports which identified issues with some of the walls at St Ninian's did not highlight any immediate risk and neither did they recommend any immediate remedial action for the walls. \\"Furthermore the reports made no recommendation to close off the area or prohibit access in any way.\\" During a storm in January 2012, in East Kilbride, Duncanrig Secondary School's wall collapsed inwards. Header ties - also called wall head restraints - were added when the wall was rebuilt. The next day, at Trinity High School in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, a wall collapsed due to structural defects similar to those found at Oxgangs Primary School in Edinburgh in 2016. South Lanarkshire Council said engineers had concerns over both design and construction failures and wall ties were part of the repair process. The work was overseen by the company who runs the schools, Morgan Sindall. After investigations at other schools in the area for which it has responsibility, a small number of additional wall ties were added at eight other sites. A spokesman for Morgan Sindall said: \\"We took a responsible approach to the issues by carrying out further investigations across the entire South Lanarkshire Secondary Schools estate for which we were responsible. \\"This identified a small number of issues, with 62 tie repairs being required at nine (including Duncarig) of the 16 schools.\\" To provide some context, the total number of wall ties used across the estate is 240,000. The spokesman added: \\"Safety is always our number one priority.\\" As pupils get ready to return to Edinburgh schools on Wednesday, following all the repairs being completed, the council said its inquiry would look at whether the failures in Edinburgh amount to a national construction issue. It said the issue could affect any public building built in the same way as the 17 school which were closed in April - with cavity walls around a steel frame. Chief executive, Andrew Kerr, said: \\"It may be that this is a national issue that has to be tackled in terms of how you supervise these works going on, how they're undertaken. We have just tried to make sure that Edinburgh schools are safe right now.\\" All the defects reported at the 30 schools identified have now been repaired. Edinburgh City Council has assured parents that buildings affected by closures are now safe for their children to return for the start of the new school year. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Wall and header ties in 30 schools across Scotland have had to be repaired after similar issues led to a wall collapse at Oxgangs Primary in Edinburgh earlier this year. The wall collapse led to 17 Edinburgh schools being closed before the summer holidays, affecting about 7,600 primary and secondary school children. Repairs have since been undertaken in several areas, including South Lanarkshire, Stirlingshire, Glasgow and East Renfrewshire. Safety inspections were ordered for the 17 Edinburgh schools, which were all built or refurbished as part of the same public-private partnership scheme."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: THE Egyptian strongman Field Marshal Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi was recently in Moscow visiting with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Putin reportedly offered Sisi 2 billion in arms — just what a country like Egypt, where half the women can’t read, needs. The whole meeting struck me as so 1960s, so Nasser meets Khrushchev — two strongmen bucking each other up in the age of strong people and superempowered individuals. Rather than discuss arms sales, Sisi and Putin should have watched a movie together. Specifically, Sisi should have brought a copy of “The Square” — the first Egyptian film ever nominated for an Oscar. It’s up this year. Sisi has a copy. Or, to be more precise, his film censor’s office does. For the last few months, the Egyptian authorities have been weighing whether to let the film — an inspiring and gripping documentary that follows six activists from the earliest days of the Tahrir Square revolution in 2011 until the Muslim Brotherhood was ousted by Sisi in 2013 — to be shown in Egypt. Meanwhile, pirated and downloaded copies of the film, which is also on Netflix, have spread virally across Egypt and been viewed by many Egyptians in homes and coffeeshops and discussed on social media. What’s more, it was recently dubbed into Ukrainian and downloaded (some 300,000 times) by protesters there and shown in the Maidan, which also means the Square, in Kiev. A dubbed version is now spreading in Russia, too, said the film’s director Jehane Noujaim, who also directed “Control Room.” “This is the globalization of defiance,” Noujaim said to me. “With cheap, affordable cameras and Internet connections, anyone now can change the conversation” anywhere. It’s true. The film resonates with those who gathered in squares from Cairo to Caracas to Kiev, added the film’s producer, Karim Amer, because it captures an increasingly universal phenomenon: average people uniting and deciding “that the Pharaoh, the strongman, won’t protect us” and the religious sheikh “won’t cleanse us.” We can be and must be “authors of our own story.” It has long been said, added Amer, that “history is written by the victors. Not anymore.” Now versions can come from anywhere and anyone. Power is shifting “from the pyramid to the square” — from strongmen to strong people — “and that is a big shift.” And that’s why Putin and Sisi need to see the film. (Disclosure: the filmmakers are friends of mine, and I have been discussing their project with them for two years.) It captures some of the most important shifts happening today, starting with fact that in today’s hyperconnected world wealth is getting concentrated at the top, but, at the same time, power is getting distributed at the bottom and transparency is being injected everywhere. No palace will remain hidden by high walls, not even the giant one reportedly being built for Putin on the Black Sea. But people now can’t just see in, they can see far — how everybody else is living. And as Tahrir and Kiev demonstrate, young people will no longer tolerate leaders who deprive them of the tools and space to realize their full potential. The Square has a Facebook page where Egyptians are invited to answer questions, including: “Who would you most like to watch this movie with?” One answer, from Magda Elmaghrabi, probably spoke for many: “I would watch it with my dad who passed away 9 years ago. He emigrated to the States not for lack of wealth, but for his fears of what would happen in the future for Egypt and whether there would be opportunities for my 2 older brothers. I would love to have discussed what occurred and see his emotional reaction as the Egyptians stood up for what they believed in.” Another reason Putin, Sisi and all their protesters need to see “The Square” is that it doesn’t have a happy ending — for anyone, not yet. Why? The Egyptian protesters got sidelined by the army, because while they all wanted to oust the Pharaoh, they couldn’t agree on a broader reform agenda and translate that into a governing majority. But Putin and Sisi will also lose if they don’t change, because there is no stable progress without inclusive politics and economics. I understand the need and longing by those not in the squares for “stability” and “order.” Putin and Sisi both rose to power on that longing for stability after so much revolutionary ferment. But both men have to be asked: Stability to do what? To go where? To jail not just real terrorists, but, in Sisi’s and Putin’s cases, legitimate journalists and opposition and youth leaders? Many Asian autocrats imposed order, but they also built schools, infrastructure and a rule of law that nurtured middle classes that eventually delivered democracy. So the protesters are long on idealism but short on a shared political action plan. Sisi and Putin are long on stability but short on a politics of inclusion tied to a blueprint for modernity (and not just rising oil prices). Unless they each overcome their deficiencies, their countries will fail to fulfill their potential — and all their “squares” will be stages for conflict, not launching pads for renewal.

A woman is seen sitting on a piece of exercise equipment and rowing back and fourth. her working out","completion":"As she continued to row with fierce determination, sweat glistened on her brow and her muscles tensed with each deliberate stroke, all the while her eyes remained fixated on the motivating poster on the wall ahead; a powerful reminder to never give up on her dreams and perhaps, more significantly, of the obstacles she had already overcome in her relentless pursuit of physical and mental well-being. Amidst the cacophony of grunts, steel clanging, and rhythmic footsteps from nearby workouts, she found her solace; for each row mirrored not just a physical journey but an emotional one, transcending the warm, fluorescent-lit gym, and taking her into a realm of self-discovery and perseverance. Her breathing grew heavier, her rhythm steadier, as the gentle hum of the rowing machine seemed to merge with the pulsating beat of her heart. Fleeting glimpses of her reflection in the gym's mirror only served to strengthen her resolve, subtly reminding her of the progress she'd made thus far. Time gradually blurred into insignificance; minutes turned to hours as her body continued to push through the physical limits she'd endured countless times before. In the corners of her mind, she felt a kinship with the swans that frequented the nearby river - their grace and elegance on the surface belying the fervent paddling that drove them forward, while she, in turn, moved to the silent rhythm of her own unyielding heart. Her thoughts then drifted to her children, who had been the catalyst for her entry into this sanctuary of self-improvement – she longed to be the epitome of strength, determination, and resilience that they could look up to. Just as the weariness began to creep into her limbs, the woman felt a sudden rush of energy, propelling her to push even harder than before. This newfound vigor seemed to emanate from a deep, familiar voice that echoed within the recesses of her thoughts – it was her late father, who had always instilled in her the importance of nurturing the mind, body, and soul in equal measure. The warmth of his memory buoyed her spirit, coaxing her to draw upon her last reserves of energy as she rowed onward. Soon, her surroundings began to fade away, melting into a potent tapestry of memories, dreams, and aspirations. She saw herself on the water's edge, watching her children laugh and play; she saw herself standing atop a mountain, the crisp air filling her lungs as she savored the breathtaking view; and finally, she saw herself in the tender embrace of her father, his proud gaze fixed upon her eyes. A final surge of emotion washed over her, and with one last powerful stroke, she released her grip and allowed the rower handle to return to its starting position. Panting and aching, she glanced at her reflection once more – her face flushed, her hair damp with effort - but her eyes sparkled with a fire that could not be extinguished. Today's workout had been more than just a journey of self-improvement; it had been an affirmation of a life that was rich with purpose, forged by grit, and fueled by love. As she rose from the piece of exercise equipment, her body weary but her spirit soaring, she knew that it was these moments – these intimate, personal victories – that would continue to propel her forward, as she chased her dreams with strength, grace, and unwavering resilience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lepus lies immediately south of Orion, where it culminates at midnight in the December sky. The name 'lepus' is Latin for hare, and the creature represented here is often said to be chased by Orion's two dogs, Canis Major and Canis Minor. This answer is correct because it accurately describes the location of the Lepus constellation in relation to Orion and provides additional information about its symbolism. Lepus is indeed located south of Orion and is associated with the hare pursued by Orion's dogs, making this a helpful description for locating the constellation. The second answer is incorrect because it states that Lepus lies immediately south and north of Orion, which is contradictory. A constellation cannot be both south and north of another constellation simultaneously. Additionally, Lepus is connected to the hare, and its position in the sky is consistent with being chased by the two dogs of Orion, not both north and south of the constellation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both ends of the straw are opened. Scenario 2: 1. We have a closed hollow tube with one end fixed on Earth. 2. The other end of the tube is raised into space. 3. Both ends of the tube are opened. Now, let's examine the outcomes of both scenarios. Scenario 1 outcome: Considering the presence of the vacuum, it would initially create suction, causing water to enter the straw. However, the gravitational force of Earth and water pressure at the bottom of the ocean would prevent the water from escaping into outer space. The water would eventually reach an equilibrium point where the external pressure balances the vacuum inside the straw. Scenario 2 outcome: Once the ends are opened, air would rush into the tube, equalizing the pressure inside and outside the tube. No significant movement of water or air would occur due to Earth's gravity and the gravitational pressure of the Earth's atmosphere. Now it's time to answer the given questions. 1.

Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about a shift in attitude among the executives at Sun Microsystems, a technology company. The company's new chief operating officer (COO) has adopted a more humble approach and suggests that the organization has made changes to improve its operations and address any problems. This departure from the typical assertiveness of the company's leadership implies that the COO is refocusing on the core values and structure of the business to ensure long-term success and sustainability. Sun Microsystems, founded in 1982, was a prominent technology company that developed computer hardware and software solutions. It was well-known for its innovations in the fields of computer systems and networking technologies. In spite of these achievements, the leadership and management at the company have faced criticism for their aggressive or overbearing attitude in the past as mentioned in the text. With the arrival of the new COO, there seems to be a willingness to acknowledge past issues and make amends. Taking a tone of humility can signify that the COO wants to distance the company from any negative perceptions or impressions held by stakeholders, such as shareholders, employees, customers, and even competitors. Through this humble approach, the company aims at rebuilding damaged relationships, regaining trust, and demonstrating that it has learned from its mistakes. The mention of mending ways implies that Sun Microsystems has implemented organizational changes or solutions that align with its commitment to improvement. This could involve altering the company's management structure, reevaluating business processes, or implementing new policies and practices that promote a healthier corporate culture.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the opera that was described as \\"the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party\\"? After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Amidst Tragedy: Tales of Heroism and Hope From the Boston Marathon Introduction: In times of darkness and despair, the human spirit perseveres as stories of heroes and helpers emerge from the ashes. The tragic bombing at the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013, was no exception, as individuals stepped up to join forces in a supreme display of human compassion and resilience. This article recounts the inspiring tales of four such people: a wounded woman searching for her hero, an NFL star carrying an injured person to safety, a grieving father who became a lifesaver, and a doctor who rushed to help after completing the race himself. The Search for Tyler: In the chaotic aftermath of the bombing, numerous lives were saved through the actions of ordinary individuals who rose to the occasion. One such person was an elusive man named Tyler, who fearlessly carried an injured woman to safety. Desperate to find her rescuer and express her gratitude, the woman embarked on a search to uncover the identity of her personal hero. With the help of social media and news outlets, her plea reached thousands, leading to their eventual touching reunion. In the face of unimaginable terror, the bond between these two strangers serves as a testament to the power of human connection and the endless capacity for hope. Joe Andruzzi: A Humble Hero: As a former offensive lineman for the New England Patriots, Joe Andruzzi was no stranger to tough situations. Despite his grueling NFL career, Andruzzi's modesty remained intact as he downplayed his actions following the Boston Marathon bombing. After spotting a severely injured woman struggling to move, Andruzzi swiftly sprung into action, lifting her into his arms and carrying her to a nearby triage tent. Rejecting any praise, Andruzzi refused to embrace the title of a hero, asserting that countless others deserved recognition for their selfless acts of bravery. Carlos Arredondo: A Father's Grief Transformed: Carlos Arredondo had originally attended the Boston Marathon to honor the memory of his son, a fallen Marine who perished in combat. However, fate had other plans. Arredondo leaped into action when the bombs detonated, transforming his grief into a steadfast determination to save lives. Equipped with only his instincts and a makeshift tourniquet, Arredondo raced to the aid of an injured man, ultimately preventing him from bleeding to death. His valiant efforts resulted in not only saving the man's life but also fostering a lifelong bond between the two. Dr. Vivek Shah: From Finish Line to Front Line: Dr. Vivek Shah had just crossed the finish line of the Boston Marathon when the bombs exploded. Instead of reveling in his accomplishment or seeking safety, he heeded the call to action and rushed toward the chaos. As a medical professional, Dr. Shah was well-equipped to provide aid alongside other doctors, nurses, and paramedics who swiftly responded to the disaster. By their tireless efforts, countless lives were saved, as they hastily treated severe injuries and coordinated evacuations to nearby hospitals. Conclusion: The actions of these four heroes – the wounded woman's savior, a humble ex-NFL player, a heartbroken father-turned-lifesaver, and a doctor who prioritized the well-being of others – exemplify the strength and spirit of the Boston Marathon's first responders. Their actions in the face of terror defy the heinous intent of the attackers.

The 'broken windows' law. enforcement strategy of aggressively pursuing petty criminals is. coming under attack, after a grand jury this week decided not to. indict a New York police officer in the chokehold death of an. unarmed black man. Eric Garner died in July after a confrontation with police. Officers tried to arrest Garner based on complaints that he was. illegally selling cigarettes on a Staten Island sidewalk. The clash between Garner and police, captured on video, has. stoked a debate over the 'broken windows' concept that says. police should pursue small violations to create a larger. atmosphere of obedience and prevent other, more destructive. crimes. Furious: Protesters have staged a third night of rallies in New York following a grand jury's decision not to indict white police officer Daniel Pantaleo over the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner. The idea dates back to the early 1980s and was popularized. by former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a Republican who governed the. city from 1994 to 2001. Giuliani's first police commissioner was. Bill Bratton from 1994 to 1996 and Bratton is in the same. position under current Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat. Some say the theory has evolved into a zero tolerance policy. that has led to disproportionate responses by police. Speaking out: Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York struck out against what she called a disproportionate response to minor crimes. U.S. Representative Jose Serrano, a Democrat who represents. a largely minority community in New York City, said on Friday. that he has asked the U.S. Justice Department to investigate New. York's policing for small crimes. 'We should carefully evaluate how 'broken windows' is being. implemented in practice and how its enforcement may be. infringing on people's civil rights,' Serrano said. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined comment on. Serrano's request. Republicans this week also questioned whether police are. appropriately focusing their attention. Senator Rand Paul of. Kentucky blamed laws such as New York City's cigarette taxes. that give rise to illegal sales and other bad behavior. 'I think, my goodness, do we not have enough violence going. on in our community that really needs to be policed that we're. going to go harass people for selling cigarettes?' Paul said on. Fox News on Thursday. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York struck out. against what she called a disproportionate response to minor. crimes. Hands up: U.S. House Member Hakeem Jeffries, a black congressman from Brooklyn, New York, said he views some 'bad apple' police officers as a threat to his son. Jeffries called the Grand Jury's decision a 'stunning miscarriage of justice' Broken policing: In the ’90s, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton presided over a surge in petty-crime law enforcement on the theory that vigorously enforcing the small laws in some way dissuades or prevents people from breaking the big ones. There’s little evidence that theory is correct. 'When you have a man who was committing an arguably. low-level offense end up dead because of the use of lethal. force, you have an issue,' Gillibrand said on MSNBC on Friday. Police backers say programs like New York's 'stop and frisk' sets the standard that bad behavior will not be tolerated and. has reduced violent crime rates. Rudy Giuliani: The former mayor built his career on scaring white New Yorkers with fears of black criminals. Last year, however, a federal. judge found the city's use of that strategy constituted a form. of illegal racial profiling, and ordered major changes. The broken windows theory was introduced by two social. scientists in a 1982 magazine article and gained traction in New. York. It posits that poorly maintained urban environments with. dirty streets, abandoned buildings and the like attract crime,. while well-kept communities are more law-abiding. Giuliani, who is largely credited with popularizing the. strategy, could not be reached for comment on Friday. He said on. Fox News on Thursday that the police response to Garner was. justified because he did not cooperate with law enforcement. But critics say police have stretched the theory beyond its. original intent into an indiscriminate zero-tolerance policy. 'If the problem is a broken window they should fix the. window,' said City University of New York law school professor. Steve Zeidman. 'But somehow we don't fix the window, we just. arrest people who start hanging out by the broken window.' Stuart Gang, a retired New York City police officer,. defended the doctrine, saying it has increased the. responsiveness of law enforcement to a range of crimes. 'There. is nothing wrong with 'broken windows',' he said. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The article is primarily about the controversy surrounding the 'broken windows' law enforcement strategy, particularly in the light of the death of Eric Garner, who died during a police confrontation over alleged illegal cigarette selling - a small crime. Its key points are: 1. Eric Garner's Death: Garner, a black man, died in a police chokehold, inciting further debate about the 'broken windows' law enforcement strategy that advocates aggressively pursuing petty infractions to create an overall atmosphere of law obedience. His death led to widespread protests after the involved officer, Daniel Pantaleo, was not indicted by a grand jury. 2. The Origins of 'Broken Windows' Theory: The theory, dating back to the early 1980s, became popular under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and his police commissioner Bill Bratton. The theory suggests that the enforcement of small laws can dissuade individuals from committing more serious crimes. 3. Political Responses: Numerous politicians have spoken against the aggressive enforcement of the 'broken windows' strategy. Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand criticised what she called a disproportionate response to minor crimes, and another Democrat, Representative Jose Serrano has asked the U.S. Justice Department to investigate New York's policing for small crimes. 4. Role of 'Stop and Frisk': Proponents of aggressive enforcement claim that programs like 'stop and frisk' set a standard that bad behaviour is not tolerated and reduce violent crime rates. However, a federal judge has ruled that this strategy was a form of illegal racial profiling. 5. The 'Broken Windows' Theory: This theory, introduced in 1982, states that poorly maintained urban environments encourage criminal behavior, while well-tended communities are more law-abiding. Critics argue that police have stretched this theory into a zero-tolerance policy leading to disproportionate responses. 6. Opinions Supporting 'Broken Windows': Some voices, such as retired New York City police officer Stuart Gang, defend the doctrine, stating that it increases law enforcement's responsiveness to a range of crimes. 7. Giuliani's Stand: Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani contends the police response was justified, as Garner apparently did not cooperate with law enforcement. Overall, the controversy centres around whether the balance of law enforcement should tilt toward aggressive tackling of petty crimes or whether such an approach leads to disproportionate responses and infringes on civil rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think-tanks such as the World Pensions Council have also argued that European legislators have pushed somewhat dogmatically for the adoption of the Basel II recommendations, adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), effective since 2008. In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself e.g. when gauging the solvency of financial institutions, to rely more than ever on standardised assessments of credit risk marketed by two non-European private agencies: Moody's and S&P. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What said that agencies had to start using Moody's and S&P to assess financial institutions?","completion":"The Basel II Accord, adopted in 2005, laid the foundation for the increased use of external credit assessments, including those from private credit rating agencies like Moody's and S&P, to evaluate the solvency of financial institutions. The primary goal of the accord was to establish a more consistent framework for banks and regulators to manage credit, market, and operational risks by providing comprehensive guidance and introducing standardized risk-weighting rules. The adoption of the Basel II recommendations led to its transposition into EU law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD), which became effective in 2008. The CRD essentially required European banks, and more importantly, the European Central Bank (ECB) itself, to rely more heavily on credit risk assessments from these rating agencies when determining the solvency of financial institutions. The push for incorporating agencies like Moody's and S&P into credit risk assessments stemmed from various reasons. Firstly, it aimed to create a more consistent, transparent, and reliable assessment mechanism across financial institutions. These credit rating agencies specialize in accurately evaluating the creditworthiness of borrowers, making them appealing sources of credit risk assessment. Secondly, it was believed that having standardized methods of credit risk assessment would minimize regulatory arbitrage opportunities, where financial institutions might engage in different practices to bypass regulations, seeking out favorable jurisdictions or adopting less stringent practices. However, some critics argue that the increased reliance on Moody's and S&P has led to an overconcentration in the credit rating market, which negatively impacts the stability and diversity of the financial system. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential conflicts of interest as these agencies provide both rating and advisory services, which might lead to biased assessments. In conclusion, it was the implementation of the Basel II recommendations and the subsequent European Capital Requirements Directive that led to the increased reliance on Moody's and S&P in assessing the solvency of financial institutions in Europe. These regulations sought to create a more uniform and robust credit risk assessment methodology but have also raised concerns about potential weaknesses arising from the overreliance on a few leading rating agencies."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: Who tries to warn the family in the station wagon?

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Australasia, a region of Oceania, comprises Australia, New Zealand, the island of New Guinea, and neighbouring islands in the Pacific Ocean. Charles de Brosses coined the term (as French \\"Australasie\\") in \\"Histoire des navigations aux terres australes\\" (1756). He derived it from the Latin for \\"south of Asia\\" and differentiated the area from Polynesia (to the east) and the southeast Pacific (Magellanica). The bulk of Australasia sits on the Indo-Australian Plate, together with India. - Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents of the superfamily Muroidea. \\"True rats\\" are members of the genus \\"Rattus\\", the most important of which to humans are the black rat, \\"Rattus rattus\\", and the brown rat, \\"Rattus norvegicus\\". Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Parrots, also known as psittacines , are birds of the roughly 393 species in 92 genera that make up the order Psittaciformes, found in most tropical and subtropical regions. The order is subdivided into three superfamilies: the Psittacoidea (\\"true\\" parrots), the Cacatuoidea (cockatoos), and the Strigopoidea (New Zealand parrots). Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several species inhabiting temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as well. The greatest diversity of parrots is in South America and Australasia. - The family Psittacidae is one of three families of true parrots, and consists of two subfamilies, the Old World or Afrotropical parrots of Psittacinae) and the New World or Neotropical parrots of Arinae. The family numbers approximately 10 species in the Old World, and 148 species in the New World, and included several species that have gone extinct in recent centuries. Some of the most iconic birds in the world are represented here, such as the blue-and-gold macaw among the New World parrots and the African grey parrot among the Old World parrots. These parrots are found in tropical and subtropical zones and inhabit Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands, sub-Saharan Africa and the island of Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Two parrots, one extinct, formerly inhabited North America. - In biogeography, a pantropical (\\"across the tropics\\") distribution is one which covers tropical regions of all continents. Examples include the plant genera \\"Acacia\\" and \\"Bacopa\\". - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Sub-Saharan Africa is, geographically, the area of the continent of Africa that lies south of the Sahara desert. According to the UN, it consists of all African countries that are fully or partially located south of the Sahara. It contrasts with North Africa, whose territories are part of the League of Arab states within the Arab world. Somalia, Djibouti, Comoros and Mauritania are geographically in Sub-Saharan Africa, but are likewise Arab states and part of the Arab world. - Psittacinae is a subfamily of Afrotropical or Old World parrots; the eleven species are found in two genera. Among the species is the iconic African grey parrot. These parrots are native to sub-Saharan Africa, the island of Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. - The true parrots are about 350 species of colorful flighted (with a few notable exceptions) hook-billed, mostly herbivorous birds forming the superfamily Psittacoidea, one of the three superfamilies in the biological order Psittaciformes (parrots). True parrots are widespread, with species in Mexico, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast Asia, Australia, and eastwards across the Pacific Ocean as far as Polynesia. The true parrots include many of the familiar parrots including macaws, conures, lorikeets, eclectus, amazon parrots, African gray parrot. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America.

The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

Choices: - store - office - cuba - photographs - pond The rationale to choose \\"pond\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"Jellyfish, belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, are primarily marine creatures found in virtually every ocean around the world. While the question originally listed five choices—store, office, Cuba, photographs, and pond—I will present a comprehensive answer that takes the broader context of jellyfish habitats into account. Before diving into the rationale, let us first briefly address the alternative options that were given: 1. Store: While it is certainly possible to find jellyfish in pet stores or specialty aquarium shops, these venues do not constitute their natural habitat. 2. Office: An office environment is highly unlikely to house jellyfish, as they need aquatic surroundings to survive. 3. Cuba: Though jellyfish can indeed be found in the waters around Cuba, this choice is rather specific compared to the more general preference of pond. 4. Photographs: While images and representations of jellyfish can be easily found in photographs, books, or online, these mediums do not constitute an actual habitat for these creatures. Now let us examine the rationale for choosing \\"pond\\" as the answer: A: While it is relatively rare for jellyfish to reside in ponds, certain freshwater species, such as the Craspedacusta sowerbii, are known to inhabit freshwater environments. These freshwater jellyfish can be found in calm bodies of water, including ponds, reservoirs, or lakes. Although the majority of jellyfish species require saltwater environments—such as oceans and seas—the presence of some freshwater species makes \\"pond\\" the most appropriate choice from the given options. In summary, although most jellyfish species reside in marine ecosystems, a select few can indeed be found in ponds or other freshwater habitats. Consequently, considering the provided choices, \\"pond\\" emerges as the most accurate answer in terms of the natural habitats where jellyfish can be found."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"In Greek mythology, the beautiful young man who was granted eternal sleep in order to remain forever young is Endymion. Endymion's story is one of the most captivating and enduring legends, intertwining themes of love, youth, and immortality. Endymion was a shepherd or a hunter, depending on the version of the tale, and he was renowned for his striking good looks and exceptional charm. He was the son of Aethlios, the king of Elis, and Calyce, the daughter of Aeolus, who was the ruler of the winds. In some versions, Endymion's mother is instead said to be Phoenissa, the sister of Aethlios, while his father is Zeus, the king of the gods. The legend of Endymion begins with the goddess Selene, who was the personification of the moon and was known for her great beauty. One night, as she was driving her moon-chariot across the sky, she caught sight of the handsome Endymion sleeping on Mount Latmus in Asia Minor. Selene was immediately captivated by his allure, and she fell deeply in love with him from that moment on. Not wanting Endymion to age, lose his beauty, or face the consequences of mortality, Selene pleaded with Zeus to grant her lover eternal youth. Zeus, taking pity on the lovesick goddess and possibly owing to his own connection to Endymion, decided to grant her request. He placed Endymion into a state of perpetual slumber, allowing him to remain forever young and unchanging. While Endymion slept, Selene would visit him every night, gazing upon his ageless beauty and showering him with affection. It is said that the couple bore fifty daughters, collectively known as the Menae, who represented the fifty lunar months of the four-year cycle of the ancient Greek calendar. Various sources suggest that Endymion had the choice of his eternal fate: endless sleep accompanied by eternal youth, or the chance to live a normal, mortal life. Endymion, recognizing the fleeting nature of human life and the inevitability of aging, chose to sleep forever, ensuring that he would maintain his youthful beauty and the love of Selene through eternity. The story of Endymion and Selene has been widely celebrated in literature, poetry, and art throughout history. It serves as an enduring symbol of eternal love and the desire for beauty and youth. Artists such as Nicolas Poussin, John Keats, and Anne Killigrew have all drawn inspiration from this tale, breathing life into the story of the beautiful young man who was granted eternal sleep in order to remain forever young."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: Which Denys Fisher geometric, plastic drawing toy produces mathematical curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids?","completion":"The Denys Fisher geometric, plastic drawing toy that produces mathematical curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids is the Spirograph. The Spirograph was invented by British engineer Denys Fisher in 1965. A Spirograph is a drawing tool that consists of a set of plastic gears, one of which has a small hole that can accommodate a pen, pencil, or any other writing instrument. There are typically two types of gears: 1. Fixed Outer Ring: A larger ring gear with small teeth on the inside, which remains stationary and acts as the frame in which the smaller gears are placed. 2. Movable Inner Gears: Smaller gears with teeth on the outer perimeter that can be placed inside the ring gear to create the desired patterns. These gears often come in various shapes and sizes. The ingenious concept of the Spirograph relies on the mathematical principles of hypotrochoids and epitrochoids, which are a family of curves generated by the relative motion of two or more circles. A hypotrochoid is a curve traced by a point attached to a smaller circle rolling within a larger circle, while an epitrochoid is a curve traced by a point attached to a circle rolling on the outside of another circle. By changing the size of the gears, their hole placement, and the way they interact, a wide range of fascinating patterns and shapes can be created. To use the Spirograph, one simply secures the outer ring gear on a piece of paper, chooses an inner gear to place within it, and inserts a pen or pencil into one of the holes in the inner gear. As the inner gear is moved around the inside of the outer ring gear, the pen or pencil traces intricate and often beautiful curve patterns that are mathematically defined as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. The Spirograph has captivated generations of children and adults alike, engaging their creativity and curiosity while providing a hands-on understanding of mathematical concepts. It remains an iconic and popular toy, offering endless possibilities for artistic expression and mathematical exploration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In contrast, Ryan found himself trying to come up with alternative workout options that wouldn't require a gym membership, but rather could be done through accessible resources available to him. He began researching bodyweight exercises, online workout tutorials, and utilizing local parks to engage in outdoor cardiovascular activities, such as running and cycling. Though initially discouraged by the sudden disruption to his usual fitness regimen, Ryan discovered new forms of physical activity that not only challenged him but also broadened his perspective on staying fit outside the confines of a gym setting.

So the most useful subjects for work are at the top and you were probably driven away from what you did as a kid at school--things you liked--because you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? Don't do music. You're not going to be a musician. Don't do art. You're not going to be an artist. In addition, the whole system of public education around the world is a process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not because the thing they were good at wasn't valued at school. I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of the history. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia.

Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Advertisement is the difficult business of bringing information to great numbers of people.The purpose of an advertisement is to make people respond to make them react to an idea,such as helping prevent forest fires,or to make them want to buy a certain product or service.At the beginning of the 20th century,advertisement was described as\\"salesmanship in print\\".If this definition were expanded to include radio and television,it would still stand today.The most effective way to sell something is through person-to-person contact.But the cost of person-to-person selling is high because it takes a great deal of time,and it increases the cost of the product or service.Advertising distributes the selling message to many people at one time.The first printed advertisement in the English language appeared in 1278,more than a century before Shakespeare's first play was produced.This early advertisement was the work of William Caxton,England's first printer,who used it to advertise religious books from his own workshop Caxton posted small printed notices along London's main streets.Besides advertising his product,he identified his shop with a red-striped shield so that customers could find it easily. This same sort of simple informational advertising is still used.Examples are the roadside signs that tell travelers that they can buy fresh corn just down the road or that there is a restaurant in the next town. The Industrial Revolution,in the 18th and 19th centuries,brought a new kind of advertising.Large factories took the place of small workshops and goods were produced in large quantities. Manufacturers used the newly built railroads to distribute their products over wide areas.They had to find many thousands of customers in order to stay in business.They couldn't simply tell people where shoes or cloth or tea could be bought---they had to learn how to make people want to buy a specific product. Thus modern advertising was born. Advertising created new markets and helped to raise standards of living as people came to...

Battery kept getting shorted out in the rain. Finally, died. Second one has gone thru 5 batteries in 3 months. Also noticed that battery compartment still gets wet in the rain.This product is a complete waste of money Is this product review negative? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the product review is indeed negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the durability and functionality of the product, which is indicated by the statement, \\"Second one I purchased on account of cat invading my driveway.\\" This indicates the reviewer purchased the product with the specific purpose of dealing with a cat invasion problem in their driveway but was disappointed with the results. A significant point made by the reviewer is the concern with the product's battery life, stating that the \\"first one lasted less than 1 year\\" and the \\"second one has gone through 5 batteries in 3 months.\\" The fact that the reviewer needed to replace the product within a year and had to constantly change batteries for the second product indicates a lack of product longevity and a high maintenance cost, both of which contribute to the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction. The reviewer’s expectation for a longer-lasting product was not met, indicating that they considered the product to be of substandard quality. Furthermore, the reviewer brings up the issue of rain affecting the product's performance, pointing out that the battery compartment is not fully waterproof, which resulted in the battery getting \\"shorted out in the rain\\" and the product ultimately dying. This shows another deficiency in the product, making it less versatile and limited in its usage, as it apparently cannot withstand outdoor conditions, which is important given its role as a deterrent for a driveway-invading cat. The final declaration made by the reviewer that the \\"product is a complete waste of money\\" unambiguously reflects their negative view due to the constant need for replacement batteries and replacement units. It implies that the investment hasn't brought the expected payoff. So, based on the dissatisfaction, concerns about longevity, practicality, and the final statement labeling the product as a \\"waste of money,\\" the review can be conclusively classified as negative. The reviewer didn't note any redeeming qualities of the product, instead focusing on its flaws and poor performance, which makes the negative nature of the review quite clear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - A machine called a pulverizer grinds the coal into a fine powder - The coal powder mixes with hot air, which helps the coal burn more efficiently, and the mixture moves to the furnace - The burning coal heats water in a boiler, creating steam - Steam released from the boiler powers an engine called a turbine, transforming heat energy from burning coal into mechanical energy that spins the turbine engine - The spinning turbine is used to power a generator, a machine that turns mechanical energy into electric energy - This happens when magnets inside a copper coil in the generator spin - A condenser cools the steam moving through the turbine - As the steam is condensed, it turns back into water - The water returns to the boiler, and the cycle begins again - Question: suppose when there are more rain storms happens, how will it affect If power doesnt reach the pulverizer.

This would lead to a disruption in the following steps. Now, let's analyze the effect of this disruption on the second effect mentioned. The second effect is the coal powder mixing with hot air for efficient burning. Without the fine coal powder, the coal cannot mix properly with hot air, and therefore the burning efficiency will decrease.

Question: \\"To extend or apply to a surface in an even layer is called what verb?\\" Context: \\"In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology. The effort was funded by ARPA (now DARPA), and the computer network that resulted was called the ARPANET. The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The verb \\"to extend or apply to a surface in an even layer\\" is called \\"spread.\\" In the context of the passage provided, the computer engineers during the 1970s were engaged in an initiative to create a computer network by linking numerous computers together across multiple research institutions in the United States. When discussing this historical information, the development and growth of the ARPANET is an excellent example to illustrate how certain technologies spread and evolved over time. The ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was created by the United States Department of Defense through its funding arm, ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency), which is now known as DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency). This new computer network was an experimental project aimed at enabling researchers and scientists to share resources, data, and information. The telecommunications technology used in this endeavor played a crucial role in spreading the network's reach by connecting computers over long distances. As the ARPANET developed, the technologies that made it possible spread and evolved throughout the research community and, eventually, to the broader public. This spreading occurred in various ways, including through the proliferation of networking protocols and the implementation of new standards. For example, the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite, which specifies the format used for exchanging data over the internet and the rules guiding that exchange, was one of the key innovations that emerged from the ARPANET project. This technology spread and gained widespread acceptance, becoming the foundation for modern internet communication. Additionally, the ARPANET’s success as a research tool helped spread the idea and necessity of computer networks to other organizations and institutions, leading to the establishment of networks such as NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) and CSNET (Computer Science Network). These networks, in turn, helped lay the groundwork for the internet as we know it today. With each technological advancement and the increasing interconnectedness of computer networks, the concept and utility of the internet continued to spread, evolving from a government-funded research initiative into the global communication and information-sharing platform that it is today. The term \\"spread,\\" in this context, aptly describes the expansion and application of these groundbreaking technologies across different sectors and industries throughout the world. In summary, the verb \\"spread\\" refers to the act of extending or applying a substance or concept evenly across a surface or domain. In the context of the growth and development of the ARPANET and its underlying technologies, \\"spread\\" accurately captures the way in which these innovations proliferated and evolved, ultimately giving rise to the vast and intricate network of computers that now collectively comprise the modern internet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Stephen Ray Vaughan (October 3, 1954 - August 27, 1990) was an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer. In spite of a short-lived mainstream career spanning seven years, he was one of the most influential guitarists in the revival of blues in the 1980s. AllMusic describes him as \\"a rocking powerhouse of a guitarist who gave blues a burst of momentum in the '80s, with influence still felt long after his tragic death.\\" Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at the age of seven, inspired by his older brother Jimmie. In May 1969, after leaving the Brooklyn Underground, Vaughan joined a band called the Southern Distributor. He had learned The Yardbirds' \\"Jeff's Boogie\\" and played the song at the audition. Mike Steinbach, the group's drummer, commented: \\"The kid was fourteen. We auditioned him on 'Jeff's Boogie,' really fast instrumental guitar, and he played it note for note.\\" Although they played pop rock covers, Vaughan conveyed his interest in the addition of blues songs to the group's repertoire; he was told that he wouldn't earn a living playing blues music and the band parted ways. Later that year, bassist Tommy Shannon walked into a Dallas club and heard Vaughan playing guitar. Fascinated by the skillful playing, which he described as \\"incredible even then\\", Shannon borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within a few years, they began performing together in a band called Krackerjack. In February 1970, Vaughan joined a band called Liberation, which was a nine-piece group with a horn section. Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm, he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughan's guitar playing, Scott Phares, the group's original guitarist, modestly became the bassist. In mid-1970, they performed at the Adolphus Hotel in downtown Dallas, where ZZ Top asked them to perform. During Liberation's break, Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song \\"Thunderbird\\". Phares later described the performance: \\"They tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.\\" Attending Justin F. Kimball High School during the early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night gigs contributed to his neglect in his studies, including music theory; he would often sleep during class. His musical career pursuit was disapproved by many of the school's administrators, but he was also encouraged by many people to strive for a career in art, including his art teacher. In his sophomore year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University, but bailed when it conflicted with rehearsal. Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and stated that he had to receive a daily note from the principal about his grooming.

She wore corrective shoes as a toddler after being born with a club foot. Hamm spent her childhood on various United States Air Force bases around the world with her family. While living in Florence, Italy, Hamm first played soccer, which was hugely popular there; her entire family quickly became involved in the sport. In 2001, Hamm was a founding player in the first professional women's soccer league in the United States, the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA), and played for the Washington Freedom from 2001-2003. Throughout the league's history, Hamm was hailed as the star of the league and used heavily in marketing and promotion. In a poll of 1,000 advertising executives conducted in 2001, she was voted \\"the most appealing female athlete\\", garnering almost twice as many votes as the runner-up Anna Kournikova. During the league's inaugural match between the Freedom and Bay Area CyberRays at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., Hamm was fouled in the penalty area resulting in a penalty kick that her teammate Pretinha converted to mark the first goal scored in the league. The Freedom won 1-0. In addition to the 34,148 fans in attendance being greater than any MLS game that weekend, the Turner Network Television (TNT) broadcast reached 393,087 households: more than two MLS games broadcast on ESPN and ESPN2. Playing as a midfielder and forward, Hamm played in 19 of the Freedom's 21 matches during the 2001 season. She led the team in goals (6) and assists (4). The Freedom finished in seventh place during the regular season with a 6-12-3 record. Hamm suffered a knee injury in November 2001 that kept her off the pitch for several months of early 2002. Despite playing only half the 2002 season with the Freedom, she finished the season with eight goals. The team finished in third place during the 2002 season with a 11-5-5 record and advanced to the playoffs. After winning the semi-final against the Philadelphia Charge 1-0, the team was defeated 3-2 by the Carolina Courage in the 2002 WUSA Founders Cup. Hamm scored the Freedom's second goal in the 64th minute. During the 2003 season, Hamm started in 16 of the 19 games in which she played. Her 11 goals ranked second on the team behind Abby Wambach's 13 while her 11 assists ranked first. The Freedom finished in fourth place during the regular season with a 9-8-4 record and secured a berth in the playoffs.

Kathy and Jacob are two coworkers out having a drink at a bar after a day at the office. They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it. Jacob says that he finds it amusing she is farsighted because he himself is nearsighted. They both laugh at the opposite nature of their eye condition, and then both look at the menu on the other side of the room to decide what drinks to order next. Hint: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

With Cheech & Chong siphoning gas from a tow truck. Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Highway Hijinks\\" Genre: Comedy Plot Summary: \\"Highway Hijinks\\" follows the absurd adventures of stoner duo Cheech and Chong as they accidentally become entangled in a high-stakes, cross-country race to save a struggling roadside diner from an evil corporation. Unbeknownst to our hapless heroes, the tow truck they siphoned gas from ends up being their unlikely ally on this wild ride. Act I: The movie begins with Cheech and Chong siphoning gas from a tow truck to keep their battered van running. After narrowly avoiding getting caught by the tow truck driver, they hit the road, unaware that the tow truck belongs to a former street racer, Lenny, who now runs his late father's struggling diner. Meanwhile, a ruthless corporation, Wayward Enterprises, wants to demolish Lenny's diner to make way for a massive shopping complex. Lenny's only chance to save his beloved diner is to win the fabled \\"Roadside Renegades\\" illegal street race, with its hefty prize money. Act II: Cheech and Chong, traveling aimlessly, stumble upon a flyer promoting the \\"Roadside Renegades\\" race. Realizing they're running low on cash (and weed), they decide to enter the race in hopes of winning the prize money. They meet Lenny at the registration point, unaware of their connection to his tow truck. As an underqualified and severely underestimated team, they all form an unlikely alliance to take on the racing circuit. Throughout the race, Cheech and Chong's reckless driving tactics and uncanny luck get them through a series of bizarre and hilarious obstacles, building an on-road rivalry with Wayward Enterprises' ruthless racing team, which is also trying to win and bankrupt the diner. Act III: As the race progresses, Lenny finally recognizes the duo as the culprits who siphoned gas from his tow truck. However, realizing the friendship they've built, he decides not to bring it up. The movie shifts to a fast-paced climax as the three underdogs work together to defeat the Wayward Enterprises team using their comedic charm, knowledge of the race route from previous street racing experience, and some timely roadside assistance from the tow truck. With Lenny's diner saved and new friendships formed, Cheech and Chong end up with more than just the cash prize. As the movie ends, we see the trio laughing and teasing each other at Lenny's newly thriving diner, forging an unbreakable bond and planning their next wild adventure. This movie, \\"Highway Hijinks,\\" combines the fun and chaotic energy of Cheech & Chong's comedic brilliance with a heartfelt friendship story that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Formed by singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus Maclise (who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965), the group was briefly managed by the pop artist Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's \\"Exploding Plastic Inevitable\\" events from 1966 to 1967. Despite achieving little commercial success during its existence, the Velvet Underground is now recognized as among the most influential bands of all time for its integration of rock music with the avant-garde. - The Exploding Plastic Inevitable, sometimes simply called Plastic Inevitable or EPI, was a series of multimedia events organized by Andy Warhol between 1966 and 1967, featuring musical performances by The Velvet Underground and Nico, screenings of Warhol's films, and dancing and performances by regulars of Warhol's Factory, especially Mary Woronov and Gerard Malanga. \\"Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable\\" is also the title of an 18-minute film by Ronald Nameth with recordings from one week of performances of the shows which were filmed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966. In December 1966 Warhol included a one-off magazine called \\"The Plastic Exploding Inevitable\\" as part of the \\"Aspen\\" No. 3 package. - Clef Records was an American jazz record label founded by Norman Granz in 1946.

Among the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were Eduardo Paolozzi and Richard Hamilton in Britain, and Larry Rivers, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns among others in the United States. Pop art presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular culture such as advertising and news. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, and/or combined with unrelated material. - Lewis Allan \\"Lou\\" Reed (March 2, 1942 October 27, 2013) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He was the guitarist, vocalist, and principal songwriter of the Velvet Underground, and his solo career spanned five decades. The Velvet Underground was unsuccessful during their active years, but gained a significant cult following to become one of the most widely acclaimed and influential bands in rock history. Brian Eno famously stated that, while the Velvet Underground's debut album sold only 30,000 copies, \\"everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band\\". - Angus William MacLise (March 4, 1938 June 21, 1979) was an American percussionist, composer, poet, occultist and calligrapher, known as the first drummer for the Velvet Underground. - The Factory was the name of Andy Warhol's New York City studio, which had three different locations between 1962 and 1984. The original Factory was on the fifth floor at 231 East 47th Street, in Midtown Manhattan. The rent was one hundred dollars per year. Warhol left in 1967 when the building was scheduled to be torn down to make way for an apartment building. He then relocated his studio to the sixth floor of the Decker Building at 33 Union Square West near the corner of East 16th Street, where he was shot in 1968 by Valerie Solanas. The Factory was revamped and remained there until 1973. It moved to 860 Broadway at the north end of Union Square. Although this space was much larger, not much filmmaking took place there. In 1984 Warhol moved his remaining ventures, no longer including filming, to 22 East 33rd Street, a conventional office building. - Maureen Ann \\"Moe\\" Tucker (born August 26, 1944) is an American musician and singer best known for having been the drummer for the New York City-based experimental rock band the Velvet Underground. - VU is an outtakes compilation album by The Velvet Underground .

Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis.

Hamilton argued that the natural faculties of blacks were as good as those of free whites, and he warned that the British would arm the slaves if the patriots did not. In his 21st-century biography, Chernow cites this incident as evidence that Hamilton and Laurens saw the Revolution and the struggle against slavery as inseparable. Hamilton attacked his political opponents as demanding freedom for themselves and refusing to allow it to blacks. In January 1785, Hamilton attended the second meeting of the New York Manumission Society (NYMS). John Jay was president and Hamilton was the first secretary and later became president. Chernow notes how the membership soon included many of Hamilton's friends and associates. Hamilton was a member of the committee of the society that petitioned the legislature to end the slave trade, and that succeeded in passing legislation banning the export of slaves from New York. In the same period, Hamilton felt bound by the rule of law of the time and his law practice facilitated the return of a fugitive slave to Henry Laurens of South Carolina. He opposed the compromise at the 1787 Constitutional Convention by which the federal government could not abolish the slave trade for 20 years, and was disappointed when he lost that argument. Hamilton never supported forced emigration for freed slaves. Horton has argued from this that he would be comfortable with a multiracial society, and that this distinguished him from his contemporaries. In international affairs, he supported Toussaint L'Ouverture's black government in Haiti after the revolt that overthrew French control, as he had supported aid to the slaveowners in 1791--both measures hurt France. Scant evidence has been interpreted by a few to indicate Hamilton may have owned household slaves, as did many wealthy New Yorkers (the evidence for this is indirect; McDonald interprets it as referring to paid employees). According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Hamilton was a strong proponent of free rights for black people.\\" is \\"No\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Hamilton was a strong proponent of free rights for black people.\\" would be \\"Yes\\".

The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf (now Kunowice Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide.

Some have argued that this arrangement was \\"fully compatible with Jefferson's views on the separation of church and state;\\" however, others point to Jefferson's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation. Still other scholars, such as Mark David Hall, attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history Answer:","completion":"The major debate among historians regarding President Jefferson is whether his views and actions were consistent with the strict separation of church and state or not."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - town - forest - countryside - rural area - park Answer:","completion":"It is most unlikely for a pond with tall buildings around it to be situated in a rural area. Let's examine each of the given options and determine the reasoning behind this conclusion: 1. Town: A pond with tall buildings around it could be found in a town setting, as towns are urban areas that often have a mix of residential and commercial structures. It is not uncommon to find water bodies like ponds incorporated into the layout of towns or cities for aesthetic, recreational, or environmental purposes. 2. Forest: Although it may seem initially unlikely, a pond could exist in a forest with tall buildings nearby, especially if the forest is located near an urban area, or if the buildings are part of a research or educational facility constructed in or near the forest. 3. Countryside: Countryside locations usually don't have tall buildings surrounding a pond, but it is not entirely improbable. For instance, a hotel or recreational facility with tall buildings might be built near a picturesque pond in the countryside to attract tourists. 4. Rural area: This is the most unlikely setting for a pond surrounded by tall buildings, as rural areas typically have lower population density, smaller structures, and more agricultural or natural landscapes. Tall buildings are a defining characteristic of urban areas, which are in stark contrast to rural settings where open spaces and farmland are more common. Therefore, it would be highly unusual to find a pond surrounded by tall buildings in a rural area. 5. Park: Parks are often designed with a mix of natural and built features, such as ponds, trees, and recreational facilities. It is possible for a park to have tall buildings nearby, particularly if the park is located within an urban setting. In conclusion, based on the characteristics and prevalence of tall buildings in each of these settings, the most unlikely location for a pond with tall buildings around it is a rural area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band? from the following article ? After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond, Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads.Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar's Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City.

Having read the novel before seeing this film, I was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot. I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte's work, and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story. In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours, the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional, thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding. There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre, so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their 'love' is superficial. This is such an injustice to Bronte's novel;you are given no impression of Jane's quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her, and his arrogance which attracts Jane to him. Despite to poor scripting, I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely, namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole, however overall the production was poor. Given a better scripting, perhaps the film would have been more successful. See \\"Jane Eyre\\" (1970) with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production.

Write an article based on this \\"Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan has been found guilty of eight charges of misconduct but will be allowed to return to work.\\"","completion":"Title: Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Found Guilty of Misconduct Yet Allowed To Return To Work Introduction In a recent, highly-publicized case, Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan has been found guilty of eight charges of misconduct. Despite this, Gargan will be allowed to return to work and continue his duties. This decision has been met with mixed responses from the public, with some questioning the reasons behind it. In this article, we delve deeper into the case and explore the implications of this controversial verdict. Background Nick Gargan, the Chief Constable of the Avon and Somerset police force, was known for his commitment to community engagement and transparency. Having served as a senior officer for both the Thames Valley and the Leicester Police, Gargan's election as Chief Constable in 2013 saw his career take a new direction. The Charges and Proceedings The charges leveled at the Chief Constable stem from a series of incidents revolving around data breaches and inappropriate communication with colleagues. The allegations, some dating back to 2014, accused Gargan of sharing restricted information unlawfully and using his position to make improper advances towards female subordinates. A special panel was convened to address these charges, and its meticulous examination led to Gargan’s conviction on eight counts of misconduct. The panel, comprising of members from the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Avon and Somerset Police and Crime Commissioner’s office, found that Gargan had indeed acted in a manner unbecoming of his position, violating the code of conduct and professional standards. The Verdict and Its Reaction In a decision that has left many perplexed, the panel ruled that despite the weight of the charges, Gargan would be allowed to return to work. This was met with an outcry of both support and disapproval from various quarters. Critics argue that Gargan's return undermines the principles of accountability and sets a dangerous precedent for others who hold similar positions of power. Conversely, some of his supporters claim that Gargan has been targeted and treated unfairly because of his high-profile status. Gargan's Return to Work Although deemed guilty of misconduct, the nature of the penalties imposed on Gargan can be considered surprising. After a period of suspension, he was allowed to return to work with a final written warning in place. This seemingly lenient action has raised questions about the extent to which senior officials are held accountable for their actions and the efficacy of the disciplinary system as a whole. Potential Implications of the Decision The case has had wide-ranging impacts. The controversy surrounding Gargan's return to work has led to a divide within the Avon and Somerset police force and the community as a whole. The ability of the Chief Constable to effectively lead the police force and maintain public trust has been called into question. Furthermore, concerns have been raised that the decision could erode public confidence in the entire police disciplinary system, undermining its effectiveness and overall purpose. If senior officers can escape serious repercussions for their actions, how can ordinary citizens trust the police's ability to hold one of their own accountable? In the wake of the verdict, additional scrutiny has been placed on the role of the Police and Crime Commissioner in the process. The case has drawn attention to the potential lack of transparency, as well as the need for an independent body to oversee disciplinary proceedings and ensure consistency in their outcomes. Conclusion The Gargan case serves as a reminder of the complex and multi-faceted nature of policing and its disciplinary system. With such high stakes at play, it is crucial that those in positions of power are held to account for their actions and face appropriate consequences. However, this case has generated more questions than answers, as it highlights the challenges involved in maintaining trust in the police force and the effectiveness of the disciplinary process. Moving forward, it is essential that police organizations and the communities they serve engage in open, honest, and constructive dialogue to ensure that all parties can trust in the system and its ability to provide justice fairly and transparently."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: The Gunpowder Plot was conspiracy to kill King James I, as well as the members of the House of Lords and Commons at the re-opening of Parliament. It was designed by a group of Catholics in protest against the anti-Catholic laws that were being introduced by the king. Robert Catesby was the leader of the group. It was he and his cousin, Thomas Wintour, and two other friends, Thomas Percy and John Wright, who formed the center of the group. They were joined by nine more men; among them was Guy Fawkes, from the city of York in the north of England. Fawkes found a store room directly under the House of Lords and rented it out under the false name of John Johnson. The conspirators stored thirty-six barrels of gunpowder there, and Fawkes, who was an explosives expert, was to light the fuses on 5th November 1605. The plot failed because one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, sent a letter to his relative, who was a member of the House of Lords. The letter warned him not to attend the opening ceremony of Parliament. The letter was passed on to the authorities, who took action. Guy Fawkes was found in the cellar on the night of 4th November with the thirty-six barrels and a number of fuses. He was imprisoned and ill-treated, eventually giving away the names of the conspirators. Soldiers of the king surrounded Holbeach House, in the Midlands, where they knew the conspirators to be hiding. In the fight that followed, four of them were shot dead, including Catesby and Percy, who were actually killed by the same bullet. The others were imprisoned and hanged along with Guy Fawkes on 31st January 1606. These days, on 5th November, children all over Britain celebrate Guy Fawkes Night by building huge bonfires and lighting fireworks. It's a family tradition and an occasion to eat potatoes baked by the flames. There is always a 'guy' on top of the fire, a model of Guy Fawkes, dressed in the clothes of the 17th century.

BELLEVUE, Nebraska (CNN) -- If LeRoy Carhart's abortion clinic had a terror alert scale, it would be at Code Red this weekend. Anti-abortion protesters plan demonstrations this weekend outside Dr. LeRoy Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska. \\"I feel safer on an airplane than I do in my clinic,\\" Carhart said, sitting at his desk in his windowless office in Bellevue, Nebraska. \\"You try to think about every way an attack could happen. You try to do all you can to prevent it, but obviously Dr. [George] Tiller thought he was safe in church.\\" It's been nearly three months since Tiller, one of the world's most well-known doctors performing abortions, was shot in the head at point-blank range on May 31 as services began at Reformation Lutheran Church in Wichita, Kansas.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation. Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body. It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients. First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday. Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again.

For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator. and a hint : The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions.

Chapter One: Grief[edit] The mother collapses at the funeral, and spends the next month in the hospital crippled with atypical grief. The father, a therapist, is skeptical of the psychiatric care she is receiving and takes it upon himself to treat her personally with psychotherapy. But it is not successful, and so when she reveals that her second greatest fear is nature, he decides to try exposure therapy. They hike to their isolated cabin in a woods called Eden, where she spent time with Nic the previous summer while writing a thesis on gynocide. He encounters a doe which shows no fear of him, and has a stillborn fawn hanging halfway out of her. Chapter Two: Pain (Chaos Reigns)[edit] During sessions of psychotherapy, she becomes increasingly grief stricken and manic, often demanding forceful sex to escape the pain. The area becomes increasingly sinister to the man, including acorns rapidly pelting the metal roof, awakening with a hand covered in swollen ticks, and finding a self-disemboweling fox that tells him, \\"chaos reigns.\\" Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide)[edit] In the dark attic the man finds the womanâs thesis studies: terrifying pictures of witch-hunts, and a scrapbook in which her writing becomes increasingly frantic and illegible.

The man is repulsed by this and reproaches her for buying into the gynocidal beliefs she had originally set out to criticize. In a frenzied moment, they have violent intercourse at the base of an ominous dead tree, where bodies are intertwined within the exposed roots. He suspects that Satan is her greatest, and hidden fear.

Top-Seed Suarez Upset at SEAT Open (AP) AP - Top-seeded Paola Suarez was upset in her opening match at the SEAT Open, losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Anabel Medina Garrigues on Thursday. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about an unexpected outcome at the SEAT Open, a tennis event. Top-seeded tennis player Paola Suarez, who was the number-one favorite to win, lost her opening match to an opponent named Anabel Medina Garrigues. The match took place on Thursday, and the results were 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 in favor of Medina Garrigues. The text is initially highlighting the surprising nature of this defeat, as Suarez, being the top-seeded player, was considered a strong competitor in the tournament and seen as having a higher chance of success. However, her loss to Medina Garrigues, who may be perceived as a less dominant player, indicates that the competition's outcome was not as clear-cut as expected. In tennis, seeding is a system used to rank players based on their performance during previous competitions. It helps to ensure that the strongest players do not face each other in the early stages of a tournament, giving them a better opportunity to face off in the final rounds. Suarez held the top-seeded position, meaning she was viewed as the highest-ranked player in the event. This high ranking generally implies a significant level of skill, experience, and likelihood to perform well in the competition. Thus, her loss to Medina Garrigues serves as a noteworthy upset in the world of tennis. The match's score, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, provides insight into the players' performance throughout the game. In the first set, Suarez lost 3-6, which means that Medina Garrigues won six games while Suarez only won three. However, Suarez managed to bounce back in the second set with a 6-3 victory, indicating that she won six games in comparison to Medina Garrigues' three. The final set was closely contested, with Medina Garrigues narrowly pulling off a win by 6-4. This suggests that both athletes demonstrated a competitive spirit and determination, with the match’s outcome ultimately being determined by a small margin. In conclusion, the text informs readers of an unexpected result at the SEAT Open, where top-ranked tennis player Paola Suarez was defeated by Anabel Medina Garrigues. The match's competitive nature is reflected in its final score, hinting at strong performances by both athletes. Suarez's loss serves as an upset in the tournament, as she was viewed as the most likely winner due to her top-seeded status. The news emphasizes the unpredictable nature of sports, demonstrating that rankings do not guarantee success and that any given player can potentially secure a victory, regardless of their pre-established position."},{"prompt":"Question: Fact 1: DNA contains genetic instructions for proteins, and RNA helps assemble the proteins.

Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones.

It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - This is a list of magazines marketed primarily for computer and technology enthusiasts or users . The majority of these magazines cover general computer topics or several non-specific subject areas , however a few are also specialized to a certain area of computing and are listed separately . - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - An online magazine is a magazine published on the Internet, through bulletin board systems and other forms of public computer networks. One of the first magazines to convert from a print magazine format to being online only was the computer magazine Datamation. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - A skill is the ability to carry out a task with pre-determined results often within a given amount of time, energy, or both. Skills can often be divided into domain general and domain-specific skills. For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be useful only for a certain job. Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used. - A control system manages, commands, directs or regulates the behaviour of other devices or systems. It can range from a home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large Industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC).

For small areas, run the injury under cool water for 5 to 10 minutes, removing any ash and allowing the pain to dull. For larger areas, submerge the wound in a bowl or tub of water. When finished, gently blot the wound with a fresh towel to dry off. Do not run the water at extremely cold temperatures or use ice. Doing so could damage the wound further. If necessary, remove any jewelry or other tight objects from the affected area before washing. After 5 to 10 minutes, wrap non-stick gauze or tissue over the wound and place a cooling pack or cold compress on it to reduce swelling. Keep the pack pressed onto the burn for 10 minutes at a time, or until it starts to feel uncomfortable. Do not use ice to treat the wound as doing so could cause tissue damage. To soothe the skin without causing further irritation, apply a thin layer of aloe vera or vitamin E gel to the burn. Do not use topical butters or ointments, which can inflame the area and cause further damage. While your skin recovers, apply a small amount of either substance to the burned area twice a day, keeping it hydrated and healthy. For open wounds, apply antibacterial ointment instead to prevent infection. For some burns, in particular those that have blistered over, a bandage will not be necessary. However, for burns with open wounds, cover the affected area in sterile non-stick gauze that's designed specifically for burns wounds. Make sure the material is loosely wrapped to avoid cutting off circulation to the area or further damaging the skin. If you're dealing with a large wound, or you don't have non-stick gauze, visit a doctor to have the burn professionally dressed. If your burn is causing a significant amount of pain, over-the-counter medications may be a good solution. Standard drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen should relieve pain without affecting the healing process. Avoid sprays and creams that have to be applied to the wound itself. Before taking pain relievers, read all label warnings thoroughly. If necessary, consult with your doctor prior to use.","completion":"To treat burns, run the affected area under cool water, remove tight objects, use non-stick gauze, a cooling pack, and aloe vera or vitamin E gel, avoid ice and topical ointments, and use over-the-counter pain medication if needed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. That Was the Week That Was, informally TWTWTW or TW3, was a satirical television comedy programme on BBC Television in 1962 and 1963. It was devised, produced and directed by Ned Sherrin and presented by David Frost. An American version by the same name aired on NBC from 1964 to 1965, also featuring Frost. The programme is considered a significant element of the satire boom in the UK in the early 1960s. A Canadian show, This Hour Has Seven Days, aired from 1964 to 1966 on CBC. Although partially inspired by That Was The Week That Was, the Canadian show mixed satirical aspects with more serious journalism. It proved controversial and was cancelled after two series amid allegations of political interference. This Hour Has 22 Minutes, created by Newfoundland comic Mary Walsh, has been running since 1992 although the two are not related. An Australian show, The Mavis Bramston Show, aired from 1964 to 1968 on the Seven Network. It grew out of the recent local theatrical tradition of topical satirical revue--most notably the popular revues staged at Sydney's Phillip Street Theatre in the 1950s and 1960s--but it was also strongly influenced by the British satire boom and especially TW3 and Not Only... But Also. The New Zealand show A Week Of It ran from 1977 to 1979, hosted by Ken Ellis, and featuring comedians David McPhail, Peter Rowley and Chris McVeigh and comedian/musicians Jon Gadsby and Annie Whittle. The series lampooned news and politics and featured songs, usually by McPhail and Gadsby, who continued with their own show, McPhail and Gadsby in similar vein. A Dutch version, Zo is het toevallig ook nog 's een keer, aired from November 1963 to 1966. It became controversial after the fourth edition, which included a parody of the Lord's Prayer (\\"Give us this day our daily television\\"). Angry viewers directed their protests especially against the most popular cast member: Mies Bouwman. After receiving several threats to her life she decided to quit the show. The show was praised as well: in 1966 it received the Gouden Televizier-ring, a prestigious audience award--though it turned out afterward that the election was rigged. An Indian version titled The Week That Wasn't was launched and hosted by Cyrus Broacha.

Article: Some good news for online holiday shoppers: bargain-hunting binges will drive prices down as web-based retailers compete to offer bigger discounts, marketing researchers predict. A recent survey by Shopzilla found that nearly 84 percent of online retailers would offer Cyber Monday discounts, up 12 percent from last year. Cyber Monday, the first Monday after Thanksgiving, is the online response to Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving when stores are traditionally flooded with customers, some of whom camp at the entrances overnight to take advantage of discounts. However, in the current economic climate, online retailers have felt pressure to offer sales and discounts even before Black Friday. But how online retailers decide to offer those big savings isn't a simple matter of trying to attract the consumers who are watching their wallets, Bohlmann of Sabanci University in Istanbul says. Online stores will also pay attention to the deals their competitors are offering, potentially leading to price wars between certain retailers to attract all those potential bargain-hunting customers. Online shoppers can be divided into two types, Bohlmann said, --switchers and --loyals. Switchers compare prices between retailers and go for the cheapest one, while loyals stick to one brand or store. It almost doesn't matter what price you charge. Online retailers will look at the percentage of switchers and loyals they have in order to decide whether to offer discounts. The more switchers they have, the more likely they will offer discounts. But retailers don't just look at the percentage of their own customers; they also look at the competition. If one online store has a higher percentage of loyals than the competitor, it can afford to keep prices higher. On the contrary, if it has a higher percentage of switchers than the competitor, it might want to lower prices. Question: It can be inferred from the text that _ Options: A: retailers should know more about customers' interest B: There will be no shoppers who go out in crowds C: Barnes&Noble's prices are lower than other companies' D: Retailers like the switchers more than the loyals A:","completion":"retailers should know more about customers' interest"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World.

Article: RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A Rio de Janeiro policeman confessed to murdering Greece’s ambassador to Brazil in what investigators on Friday called a “cowardly act” carried out at the direction of the diplomat’s Brazilian wife with whom the officer was romantically involved. Ambassador Kyriakos Amiridis, 59, was missing since Monday night. Françoise, his Brazilian wife and the mother of their 10-year-old daughter, reported him missing to police on Wednesday. Officer Sergio Moreira, 29, confessed to police on Friday that he killed the ambassador late Monday night in the Rio de Janeiro home the Amiridises owned in Nova Iguaçu, a hardscrabble neighborhood in the city’s sprawling, violent northern outskirts. Investigator Evaristo Magalhaes told reporters that Françoise, 40, and Moreira had arranged the murder a few days in advance. Both Amiridis’ wife and the officer are in custody. Police have also detained a cousin of the officer, who Magalhaes said acted as a lookout while the crime was committed and helped carry the body from the house with the promise that he would be paid 80,000 reais (25,000). “This was a tragic, cowardly act, but we worked tirelessly to crack this case as soon as possible,” Magalhaes told a news conference. “It was a crime of passion.” Brazilian President Michel Temer, in a letter addressed to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, said the ambassador’s killing had caused him profound sadness and he extended his condolences to the ambassador’s family, friends and the Greek people. The Greek embassy in Brasilia declined to comment. In Athens, Greek foreign ministry spokesman Stratos Efthymiou said the government also had no comment. Amiridis served as Greece’s consul general in Rio from 2001 to 2004. He was Greece’s ambassador to Libya from 2012 until he took the top Brazil post at the beginning of 2016. Greece's ambassador to Brazil, Kyriakos Amiridis (C), is seen after a government ceremony with Brazil's President Michel Temer in Brasilia, Brazil May 25, 2016. Marcos Correa/Brazilian Presidency/Handout via REUTERS BLOOD ON COUCH Magalhaes said that blood was found on a couch inside the home and the ambassador was likely stabbed to death as no shots were reported in the area. However, he said it was not yet possible to determine the exact cause of death because the policeman had burned the ambassador’s body in an attempt to cover up the crime. A burned corpse was found on Thursday evening inside the car that Amiridis and his wife had rented. It was parked under a highway overpass in the area where the couple had been staying. Slideshow (3 Images) On Thursday, police confirmed that the ambassador had been missing since Monday night, when he was last seen leaving the Rio home he shared with his wife, which was located near her family’s residence in Nova Iguacu. The incident is another blow to Rio’s image, just four months after it hosted the Summer Olympics. Crime in Rio has been rising and the state is deeply indebted, often unable to pay police and other salaries on time, if at all. The neighborhood where the car was found is dominated by powerful and politically connected armed groups comprised mostly of off-duty or retired police and firefighters who control vast areas. They often extort residents in exchange for keeping drug gangs from taking over the areas. The armed groups have grown for several years and often curry favor with local politicians by promising to deliver votes from entire neighborhoods as long as authorities allow them to carry out their crimes.

Mr Amiridis, 59, went missing three days ago after travelling to Rio from Brasilia for the traditional New Year celebrations on Copacabana beach. He was last seen on Monday in the city of Nova Iguacu on the outskirts of Rio, where the car was found. Forensic experts are carrying out tests to establish the body's identity. The ambassador's car was discovered under a flyover on one of the main access roads to Rio. He had phoned his wife from a flat in Nova Iguacu on Monday saying he was about to go out. He has not been heard from since. Police say it is unlikely that he was kidnapped, as no ransom has been sought. Rio has a high crime rate and violent incidents are not unusual, especially in the busy season between Christmas and New Year, when hundreds of thousands of tourists travel to the city. |||||Summary:","completion":"A policeman from Rio de Janeiro has admitted to killing Greece's ambassador to Brazil, Kyriakos Amiridis.

Given the question: I can use this background: For example, a radioactive isotope of iodine (I-131) is used in both the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer. The thyroid will normally absorb some iodine to produce iodine-containing thyroid hormones. An overactive thyroid gland will absorb a larger amount of the radioactive material. If this is the case, more and more radioactive iodine can be administered, where it will cluster in the diseased portion of the thyroid tissue and kill some of the nearby cells. Cancer treatments often cause patients to feel very sick, because while the radiation treatment kills the unwanted cancer cells, it causes damage to some healthy cells in the process. Now, I have a new situation: John is a doctor in a local hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A has thyroid cancer, but patient B does not have thyroid cancer. John is trying to see the difference between these two patients' reports. Answer this question please: Which patient would have an overactive thyroid gland, patient A or patient B? The answer is:","completion":"Patient A would have an overactive thyroid gland. This is because Patient A has thyroid cancer, which can cause the thyroid gland to absorb a larger amount of radioactive material like I-131, as mentioned in the provided background information.

Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city.

This should be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"This should be the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable. Let's analyze the sentence in more detail. Syntactically, the sentence follows the standard structure of the English language by adhering to the basic grammar rules: 1. It begins with a determiner 'This.' Determiners are used to specify or give information about nouns. In this case, 'This' is used to point to the idea of beginning a friendship. 2. The word 'should' is a modal verb. Modal verbs are used to express different levels of certainty, possibility, obligation, or advice. In this context, 'should' is used to express a greater sense of expectation or suggestion that the beautiful friendship is about to begin. 3. The verb 'be' is the main verb, and it takes its base form here because it follows the modal verb 'should.' The verb ‘be’ acts as the auxiliary verb in the sentence, and it helps to provide additional information about the main action – the friendship. 4. The noun phrase 'the beginning' follows the verb. 'Beginning' is a singular countable noun, and 'the' is the definite article that refers to a particular beginning. 5. The preposition 'of' is used to express a relationship between the noun 'beginning' and the following noun phrase 'a beautiful friendship.' 6. The noun phrase 'a beautiful friendship' is composed of an indefinite article 'a,' an adjective 'beautiful,' and a singular countable noun 'friendship.' The adjective 'beautiful' provides a positive quality or attribute to the noun 'friendship.' Semantically, the sentence is also acceptable as it conveys a clear and coherent meaning. The idea expressed in the sentence is that the speaker expects or suggests that the current situation or moment could be the start of a wonderful friendship. This sentence is often used in a positive context to convey optimism, hope, or possibility for a lasting and meaningful connection between two individuals. In conclusion, the next sentence \\"This should be the beginning of a beautiful friendship\\" is both syntactically and semantically acceptable because it follows the standard grammar rules and conveys a clear and coherent meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Gorgias (c. 485 c. 380 BC) was a Greek sophist, Italiote, pre-Socratic philosopher and rhetorician who was a native of Leontini in Sicily. Along with Protagoras, he forms the first generation of Sophists. Several doxographers report that he was a pupil of Empedocles, although he would only have been a few years younger. \\"Like other Sophists he was an itinerant, practicing in various cities and giving public exhibitions of his skill at the great pan-Hellenic centers of Olympia and Delphi, and charged fees for his instruction and performances. A special feature of his displays was to invite miscellaneous questions from the audience and give impromptu replies.\\" He has been called \\"Gorgias the Nihilist\\" although the degree to which this epithet adequately describes his philosophy is controversial. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - Aashiqui (translation: \\"Love\\") is a 1990 Bollywood musical romance film directed by Mahesh Bhatt, starring Rahul Roy, Anu Aggarwal, and Deepak Tijori in pivotal roles. The film made the careers of singer Kumar Sanu and composers Nadeem-Shravan. Upon release it received positive reviews and emerged as an all-time blockbuster. The soundtrack album has been rated the fourth best ever by Planet Bollywood on their \\"100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks\\". - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - Rahul Roy (born 9 February 1968) is an Indian film actor, producer, and former model known for his works in Bollywood, and Television.

Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: Why is the narrator and their friend so in awe of the sculpture at the park ?","completion":"The passage does not provide explicit information about why the narrator and their friend are in awe of the sculpture at the park, but we can infer possible reasons from the context. Firstly, the sculpture is described as a \\"giant horse\\", which indicates it is an unusually large or impressive depiction of a horse. Such an extraordinary and oversized artwork of an animal can lead to a feeling of awe in onlookers, as it is a reflection of great skill and artistry. The size and craftsmanship involved in creating the giant horse sculpture might have captured the narrator's and their friend's attention, evoking awe and admiration. Secondly, this sculpture is referred to as their \\"favorite\\" in the park, which suggests that it holds a special place in their hearts or it stands out compared to other installations in the park. It could be that the sculpture resonates with them on a personal level or its aesthetics aligns with their interests and preferences, enhancing their sense of wonder and amazement. Lastly, considering the activities they engaged in later on, such as visiting the Taste of Grand Rapids and sampling diverse local cuisine, it can be inferred that the narrator and their friend appreciate unique experiences and cultural elements. The Ethiopian food they enjoyed, such as stewed lentils and injera, is also an indication of their interest in exploring different cultures. Consequently, the giant horse sculpture could represent an artistic or cultural element they find fascinating, heightening their awe and appreciation.

Write a title for this article: •The best Provence rosé wines A beaujolais cru (from one of the 10 villages in the region producing superior wine that are allowed to use their names on the label – Chiroubles, Fleurie, Brouilly and so on) usually has enough of a glint of granite about it to work well with lentils. Go for Morgon if you like a bit more mass in your wine; it is still light as gamay always is but of all the crus Morgon is the deepest and most robust. Lighter reds offer the brio and pep you want from that first glass of the evening. Photo: ALAMY Don’t forget the Italian light reds. Bardolino, from the Lake Garda area, has fallen out of fashion but it’s also good with fish (wrapped in prosciutto, especially) – and, again, earthy brown lentils. The sappy brightness of a lighter red wine can also work well at a barbecue. The instinct here is usually to open big reds – tannic, high in alcohol, as mighty as a blood transfusion – that can square up to the hullabaloo of the spicy rubs and smoke on the food. The opposite is also possible: pick a red that is low on tannin and body and it will give the impression of refreshing between mouthfuls. •Best wines on offer this summer Chilly lighter reds, from sparkling lambrusco to dolcetto to gamay to cabernet franc, are a good option with most spreads of foods – helped along by a tang of acidity, they roll up their sleeves and just get on with fitting in with all the different flavours. I tend to choose Italian reds for picnics or suppers where bitter flavours – such as rocket or endives – or Parmesan cheese are involved. The cheery berry flavours of cabernet franc are gorgeous either with barbecued steak or home-made burgers, or with leftover roast beef and a pile of salads. And chips. •Wine tasting notes: reds for a barbecue summer The warm climate of Sicily is not a place you would expect to find lighter-bodied red wines but one of my favourite summer coolers comes from the south-eastern corner of this fertile island. Cerasuolo di Vittoria is made from two red grapes – nero d’Avola and frappato – and it’s a gorgeous, smooth, tangy red wine, like cooled, stewed red plums, brilliant with food with rich, cooked tomato flavours. You can also drink them with fish, and they are really good with the sweet taste of cooked yellow and red peppers. •Light, bright and elegant: the new Australian wines Also on Sicily, the red wines of Etna, usually made from nerello mascalese grapes grown on the lava-rich black soils, are light and taut, with a highly distinctive flavour. Like pinot noir, these are wines that are highly marked by the place in which they’re grown, a trait that has won them many serious-minded wine admirers. Zweigelt and St Laurent, two lesser-known varieties found in Austria, are good fridge reds, too. Precise and deliberate, you could drink them with a summer beef casserole if the weather gets that bad. They also liven up a sausage and salad dinner. I like to drink these wines with marinated chicken thighs and Ottolenghi salads. You know how those salads often have tricky ingredients such as nigella seeds or small amounts of chilli meaning that some wines can taste over-sweet next to them? Well these have an edge that works, especially after 20 or 30 minutes in the fridge. 2013 Italy (13%, Tanners, £13.30) Dolcetto is the third red grape of Piemonte (after nebbiolo and barbera) and often gets forgotten, or if not forgotten then not properly appreciated. This is no ordinary dolcetto. It drips with black cherries, and has lots of mass and spice and an almost fibrous texture, thanks to the fact that it’s unfiltered. Heaven. A real treat. J-P Brun Terres Dorées Moulin à Vent 2013 Beaujolais, France (12%, Savage Selection, £15.60) If you were looking for a wine to show the gulf in quality between the best beaujolais and the nouveau we were plagued by for years I would put this forward. Superb in every respect, this is a serious beaujolais cru that has the quivering, frisky, fresh berry edge but real meatiness and earthiness too. Utterly compelling. 2013 France (12.5%, Tesco, £5.99) A very respectable beaujolais for the price, it delivers gamay’s characteristic summer pudding flavours with just a tinge of graphite. Only a few places remain on an exclusive Telegraph wine-tasting tour, led by Victoria, to the Douro Valley in Portugal from September 21 to 24. Call 03330 059068","completion":"Title: Light Red Wines - A Delightful Choice for Summer Dishes and Warm Weather Pairings In this article, we explore the allure of light red wines for summer dishes and warm weather pairings. For wine enthusiasts and casual drinkers alike, the warmer months often call for chilled bottles of refreshing white or rosé wines. However, light red varietals can deliver an equally satisfying accompaniment to seasonal meals and outdoor dining experiences. Starting with Provence rosé wines, which are known for their beautiful salmon-pink color, the perfect balance between crisp acidity and fruity flavors can be found. The bright, refreshing taste of these wines is ideal for sipping poolside or enjoying alongside grilled seafood and fresh summer salads. Beaujolais Crus, produced in the ten villages of the Beaujolais region, offers a granite-like texture that pairs well with earthy lentils and other legumes. Morgon, one of the villages in the region, produces particularly robust red wines that still retain the lightness of the Gamay grape. These wines are perfect for those who enjoy a slightly more substantial red wine during the warmer months. Italian light reds, such as Bardolino from the Lake Garda area, have fallen out of favor in recent years but are equally adept at complementing a variety of dishes. These wines work well with fish dishes like prosciutto-wrapped tilapia and earthy brown lentils. At barbecues, the natural inclination may be to reach for bold, full-bodied wines that can stand up to the intense flavors of grilled meats and spicy rubs. However, lighter reds with low tannin levels can provide a refreshing contrast, cleansing the palate between bites. Versatile light red wines like Lambrusco and Cabernet Franc work well with a variety of foods and flavors, thanks to their refreshing acidity. These wines work especially well with bitter greens, such as rocket and endive, or simply with a juicy burger straight off the grill. Sicilian red wines, particularly Cerasuolo di Vittoria, provide a delightful summer cooler that pairs well with tomato-based dishes, fish, and grilled vegetables. Meanwhile, Etna red wines, made from Nerello Mascalese grapes, offer a highly distinctive flavor that elevates any meal. Austrian reds, such as Zweigelt and St Laurent, are also perfect candidates for chilling. Precise and deliberate, these wines can be enjoyed with a summer beef casserole or sausage and salad dinner, as well as marinated chicken thighs and gourmet salads. By exploring these lesser-known light red wine options, you may discover a new world of delicious pairings perfect for savoring over the warmer months. From Sicilian Cerasuolo to Austrian Zweigelt, there is a light red wine suited to every palate, and they are waiting to be enjoyed in the sunshine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said.

Q: Title: I haven't even played the game. Review: I haven't even played the game ,but it had one review and a five star rating so I thought I would bring it down a little. Is this product review negative? A:","completion":"It is essential to analyze various aspects of the product review in question to determine whether or not it is negative. We will dissect different components of the review to evaluate its sentiment and fairness. First, let's examine the context. The reviewer admits to not having played the game, which precludes them from providing a personal, informed opinion about it. By drawing attention to their inexperience with the product, the reviewer undermines their credibility, as feedback from an inexperienced user is arguably less valuable than from someone who has played the game. This could be viewed as a negative aspect of the review. Second, we will look at the reasoning behind the review. The reviewer states that they chose to write a review primarily because they saw one review already posted with a five-star rating. The motivation here is not to provide an honest assessment of the product but rather to intentionally \\"bring it down a little.\\" This deliberate attempt to lower the game's overall rating without having personal experience with it could be considered a negative reflection on the reviewer. However, it is essential to recognize that the reviewer did not provide specific negative feedback about the actual product. They do not mention any flaws, shortcomings, or issues with the game. This absence of direct criticism indicates that the primary objective of the review is to affect the game's rating rather than critique the product itself. In conclusion, it is fair to categorize this product review as negative, primarily due to the reviewer's inexperience with the game and their expressed intention to lower its overall rating without providing any substantive critiques. Although the review does not directly attack the game's quality, its motivations and lack of credibility make it a negative evaluation that could potentially affect the product's reputation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The app, a play on the stage name of Mr. Evans - Chubby Checker, was created by developer Magic Apps, was designed as a calculator for estimating the penis size of a man given the input of his shoe size. The app was downloaded 84 times before being removed from the App Catalog in September of 2012 and no longer available in the store on device or in the App Catalog web listings. \\"Chubby Checker\\" is held as a trademark by the Ernest Evans Corporation. The lawsuit claims that HP and Palm's \\"use of the name 'Chubby Checker' in its app is likely to associate platiff's marks with the obscene, sexual connotation and images,\\" and that Evans has \\"received no compensation for the unauthorized use of the Chubby Checker name and trademark\\". Additionally, the lawyers allege that customers that have looked at or purchases The Chubby Checker app \\"are being misled into believing that the plaintiffs have endorsed the defendant's app.\\" Up to its removal, The Chubby Checker had clocked fewer than 100 downloads. The lawsuit is demanding that HP and Palm cease sales of the app bearing the trademark of or similarity to Chubby Checker and triple damages of the profits HP derived from sales of the app. When listed, The Chubby Checker retailed for 0.99; with sales of no more than a hundred copies and the 30% cut taken by Palm and HP from the App Catalog, damages could total upwards of 90.00. Apart from the 90.00 in profit damages, the lawsuit seeks additional damages to the tune of half a billion dollars for irreperable damage done to the Chubby Checker name. For their part, when contacted regarding this lawsuit, HP provided us with this statement: \\"The application was removed in September 2012 and is no longer on any Palm or HP hosted web site.\\" Aaaaaand… that's enough straight-faced talk about this. Are you kidding me? Seriously, is this a joke? I understand the desire and right to defend one's trademark against infringement. The brand of Chubby Checker is no doubt a valuable one, what with the iconic 1960's dance and all, but of all the things to file a lawsuit over. HP's merely the host of the app - and isn't anymore, with The Chubby Checker having been removed from the App Catalog over four months ago. The legal fees alone for this lawsuit will far outweigh any potential damages (legally allowed to by tripled), assuming the case isn't settled (unlikely) or thrown out all together (likely). If HP's made a whopping 30 off sales of The Chubby Checker, then developer Magic Apps has clocked a whopping 70. That's a potential damages award of 210! Totally worth another lawsuit, wouldn't you say? And now for the most absurd part of this whole thing: it's a penis size app with a clever name. Aside from my being assured that there is no scientific evidence to support the shoe size to penis size correlation (You know what they say about guys with big feet? Big shoes.), it's a silly app that is getting infinitely more coverage now that it's no longer available and the subject of an ill-targeted lawsuit than it ever did when in the App Catalog. Okay, really the most absurd part is the demand for half a billion dollars in damages. With all due respect to Mr. Evans, Chubby Checker will never be a brand worth five hundred million dollars. Seeking that much in the way of damages for an app that nobody had heard of until this ludicrous lawsuit was filed is, for lack of a better term, just plain silly. Said Gary in a statement a prepared statement: \\"We cannot sit idly and watch as technology giants or anyone else exploits the name or likeness of an innocent person with the goal of making millions of dollars. The defendants have marketed Chubby Checkers' name on their product to gain a profit and this just isn't right.\\" I'll tell you what just isn't right: this ridiculous puffed up lawsuit. And maybe something with Mr. Gary, though we're not going to comment on his shoe size. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"A federal lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court, Florida's Southern District, against HP and Palm on behalf of performer Ernest Evans over the companies' hosting of an app called \\"The Chubby Checker\\" in the webOS App Catalog.

Williams - who also goes by the stage name Mirkat and is from Strasburg - however she failed to attend any of the court hearings so they were dismissed.

Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ...

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Anthony Bond. PUBLISHED:. 08:51 EST, 22 March 2012. |. UPDATED:. 02:36 EST, 23 March 2012. A former soap star who admitted driving the getaway car in a gangland shooting has been jailed for perverting the course of justice. Brian Regan, 53, who played Terry. Sullivan in Channel 4's Brookside, was found not guilty at Liverpool. Crown Court over his role in the killing of nightclub doorman Bahman. Faraji, 44. However, he was convicted of two counts of perverting the course of justice by lying to police in the early stages of the murder investigation and disposing of a pair of gloves he wore on the night. Jailed: Former Brookside actor Brian Regan, left, was cleared of murdering a nightclub doorman but was jailed for perverting the course of justice. He is pictured right as his Brookside character Terry Sullivan. Regan, who was on bail for supplying cocaine when the murder took place, was jailed on January 25 for a total of four years and 10 months. The facts can now be revealed after Mrs Justice Nicola Davies lifted reporting restrictions put in place to avoid prejudicing the trial of another defendant, Jason Gabbana, who was today convicted of the murder. Bahman Faraji, known by the nicknames Batman and Ben, was gunned down in a 'ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution'. Prosecutors said it was the result of an argument between criminals. Those involved in the shooting went to extraordinary lengths to lure Mr Faraji, 44, to his death on February 24 last year. He had gone to the Belgrave public house that night following a series of phone calls he received from a pay-as-you-go mobile phone. Victim: Nightclub doorman Bahman Faraji was shot in the face. 'This was a dirty phone obtained for the purpose of luring Mr Faraji to his death and used in a disciplined way that was designed to leave no clue as to the identity of its user,' prosecutor Brian Cummings QC had told the jury. Regan's unwitting involvement began when he delivered a £30 bag of cocaine to drug user Edward Heffey. The former soap star told the trial he would supply Heffey, a convicted armed robber, with drugs 'about three or four times a day'. That night, '(Heffey) asked for a lift to go and get money so he could pay for the drugs', Regan said. The pair then drove to Belgrave Road, around the corner from the pub, and Heffey left the vehicle as Regan snorted a line of cocaine. Mr Faraji arrived at the Belgrave in the company of two other men shortly after 6.30pm on the night of his murder. They spent about 10 minutes in the pub before they went outside and stood on the pavement. A short while later the gunman approached and said to Mr Faraji, 'Are you Ben?'. Mr Faraji nodded and the killer raised his shotgun and fired it directly into the victim's face from a distance of three or four feet. Mr Faraji fell to the ground in a cloud of smoke and died instantly as Heffey ran back to the waiting car. Detective Chief Inspector Neil Bickley of Merseyside Police's major incident team said it was a 'shocking' crime. He added: 'Any murder is an appalling event but to me this was striking - it was 6.50pm in a quiet residential area outside a pub during half-time in a Liverpool match. 'What became apparent during the investigation and from the evidence in the trial is that Mr Faraji had received a telephone call in the evening requesting him to go to the pub for a meeting. 'That call was from a dirty phone which was used to deliberately lure him to the pub to be shot.' Mr Bickley added: 'The defendants have never volunteered any information to suggest what the motive was. Actor: Brian Regan can be seen performing in a play called '30 Days in Walton Jail' back in 2008. Brutal: The murder occurred outside the Belgrave pub in Aigburth, Liverpool, pictured, which is in a quiet residential area. 'It would seem likely to me that Mr Faraji thought he was going to meet somebody he knew. 'It's entirely possible that was for some sort of illicit meeting but we really don't know at this stage.' Following the shooting, detectives launched a murder investigation and began by hunting for the getaway car, a red Ford Escort estate, which had been spotted by witnesses and on CCTV. The next day, police stop-checked the vehicle in Liverpool city centre and at the wheel was Regan alongside girlfriend Christine Line. Regan initially told police he had not been anywhere near the area where the murder took place. But Line's witness statement contained significant differences and detectives became suspicious. Caught: Brian Regan drove Edward Heffey, left, to the pub on the night of the murder. Jason Gabbana, right, has been convicted of the murder. The couple were arrested that night and Regan's efforts to distance himself from the shooting quickly unravelled. Mr Bickley said: 'The last thing the police need at the start of an investigation is somebody trying to wrong foot them. 'That's clearly what Regan's statements were intended to do. 'Fortunately, we were not wrong footed for too long but it is completely unacceptable to mislead the police at any time and certainly at the start of a murder investigation when time is so critical for us.' The jury was told that on the way to the police station, Regan said: 'I done nothing wrong and I didn't do anything willingly.' He also told detectives: 'I want to help you but I'll be shot.' After giving evidence against his co-accused, the court ordered security be stepped up around Regan and that security guards sit between him and the rest of the defendants. He was also designated a 'vulnerable prisoner' and placed in the isolation wing of his jail. Popular: TV show Brookside - which Brian Regan starred in - was set in this residential close in Liverpool. Prisoner: Regan was found not guilty at Liverpool Crown Court, pictured, over his role in the killing of Faraji but he was jailed for perverting the course of justice. Mr Bickley said the murder had left a 'devastating' mark on Mr Faraji's family. 'There is a six-year-old son who is going to grow up without knowing his dad and that is appalling,' the detective added. 'It is going to take an awful long time for them to come to terms with what's happened.' Paul Whittaker, the chief crown prosecutor for Merseyside, said: 'This was a ruthlessly planned and callously carried out execution of a 44-year-old man in a quiet residential street in a suburban part of Liverpool. 'The whole circumstances of the offence are quite shocking. 'The police and the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) will not spare any effort to investigate, prepare and pursue these cases and together we are absolutely committed to driving all organised crime and gun crime out of Merseyside.'

The constellation Pavo represents which bird?","completion":"The constellation Pavo represents the bird known as the peacock. Pavo is a Latin term, which directly translates to \\"peacock\\" in English. The constellation is situated in the southern sky, and it belongs to a family of constellations called “Johannes Bayer’s Southern Constellations.” This group of constellations was introduced by the German astronomer Johannes Bayer in the early 17th century through the publication of his star atlas named \\"Uranometria\\" in 1603. The constellation Pavo is mainly visible from the Southern Hemisphere, and particularly so during late winter and spring. The best months for optimal observation are typically around July and August. Due to its southern location, Pavo is rarely visible from most of the Northern Hemisphere. In the story of the constellation's creation, much like other constellations, there is a mythological background associated with Pavo. According to Greek mythology, peacocks were sacred creatures to the goddess Hera, the wife of the supreme god Zeus. The stunning pattern of the peacock's feathers and their beautiful iridescent plumage caught the attention of the gods and was associated with royalty, immortality, and the divine. Furthermore, in mythological tales, the peacock's feathers are frequently linked with the story of Argus, the hundred-eyed giant. Argus was commanded by Hera to watch over Io, a maiden whom Zeus desired. After Zeus had Argus killed to free Io, Hera took Argus's hundred eyes and placed them on the peacock's tail as a tribute to the fallen giant and a symbol of the all-seeing immortal. The constellation Pavo contains a variety of fascinating celestial objects, including several notable stars like Alpha Pavonis, also known as Peacock, which is the brightest star in this constellation. In addition to that, Pavo has a yellow supergiant star called Beta Pavonis and a variable star called Delta Pavonis. It also houses a few deep-sky objects, such as the spiral galaxy NGC 6744 that bears a remarkable resemblance to our own Milky Way, as well as some open and globular clusters that are best observed using telescopes. In summary, the constellation Pavo represents the peacock, a bird considered sacred in Greek mythology and admired for its stunning beauty. The constellation itself is relatively young compared to other constellations and can be primarily seen from the Southern Hemisphere. Its celestial objects create an interesting target for astronomers and skywatchers alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Doing this when you first wake up allows you to start the day feeling grounded in your body.","completion":"To begin a body scan, find a quiet and comfortable space where you can either sit or lie down, ideally free of distractions. Close your eyes and take a few deep, slow breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth. Allow your body to relax and try to clear your mind of any thoughts or worries. Next, bring your attention to your feet and notice how they feel against the floor or surface you're on. Observe any sensations, such as warmth, coolness, pressure, or tingling, and try not to judge or label them as good or bad—simply acknowledge their presence. Gradually move your awareness upwards through your legs, hips, torso, arms, and head, pausing at each area to notice the sensations present. Throughout the body scan, remember to maintain a gentle and curious attitude, treating your body with kindness and without judgment. If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to the area you were scanning and continue the process. The goal is not to force relaxation, but rather to develop an awareness of your body and its sensations as they are in the present moment, without trying to change or control them. Completing a body scan in the morning can offer numerous benefits for your well-being. It sets the tone for the rest of your day by cultivating a mindful and intentional state of being, which can lead to increased focus and productivity. Additionally, this practice can help reduce stress and anxiety by grounding you in the present moment and preventing you from getting caught up in negative thoughts or emotions. It can also improve your relationship with your body by fostering an attitude of self-compassion and acceptance. Incorporating a body scan practice into your daily routine may seem challenging at first, but with time and consistency, it can become an instinctive and enjoyable way to start your day with intention. You might experiment with different guided body scan meditations or try varying the duration and pace of your practice to find what works best for you.

A terminally ill man from Ohio was able to give his daughter away at her wedding Saturday — with the assistance of an all-volunteer hospital caravan. Lying in a gurney and connected to a portable ventilator and heart monitor, Scott Nagy, 56, who suffers from metastatic urethral cancer, was transported by ambulance from University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center in Cleveland to First Lutheran Church in Strongsville, nurse practitioner Jacky Uljanic, who helped organize the event, told NBC News. \\"The planning had to be pretty strategic,\\" she said. \\"It took probably about three weeks to get everything together.\\" Uljanic said two paramedics had volunteered their time as well as their ambulance to take Nagy to the wedding. Other volunteers included a nurse, an additional nurse practitioner and a doctor who followed the ambulance to the church. \\"When we walked in with him at the church there were tissues to faces,\\" she said. \\"The entire congregation started clapping.\\" Uljanic said Nagy was able to stay for the entire wedding and even had a little extra time after to pose with family and friends in the church parking lot. Janice Guhl, director of media and public relations with University Hospital Seidman Cancer Center, lauded the staff for their willingness to volunteer. \\"The nurses really rallied and were able to take him to the church,\\" she told NBC News. Alicia Reale, media relations manager with Seidman, said the nurses even had scheduled a barber to visit the hospital to groom Nagy's beard and cut his hair. John Kuntz / The Plain Dealer via Landov Scott Nagy's wife Jean pins the corsage to her husband's jacket before the start of their daughter's wedding ceremony at First Lutheran Church in Strongsville, Ohio, on Oct. 12. University Hospital sent a medical team along with Scott who is bound to his bed. The ambulance ride to the church was donated by Physicians Medical Transport. “I think it went so far as they helped to get sheets for his gurney that would match the wedding colors,\\" Reale said. Nagy, who was first diagnosed with the deadly disease last November, has been at Seidman's intensive care unit since August and has undergone chemotherapy, Uljanic said. Uljanic added that is was Nagy's goal to survive long enough to attend his daughter's wedding, which was originally scheduled for next year, but moved up in March, according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. \\"He was very thankful we could make this happen for him,\\" she said. ||||| CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Scott Nagy thought a dad's promise ought to be kept. He kept his. The cancer invading his body doesn't give him much time. A volunteer team of medical professionals gave him enough on Saturday to keep a vow to his daughter on her wedding day. He made the crosstown trip by ambulance, from an intensive-care bed at University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center to First Evangelical Lutheran Church in Strongsville. Monitor cords ran from under his charcoal tuxedo, and a tracheal tube loosened his tie. His wife, Jean, fastened a boutonniere to his lapel at the church and gave him a kiss. Bride Sarah Nagy met him in the vestibule, burst into tears and told him she loved him. \\"We did it,\\" Nagy said with a reassuring smile, telling his daughter he was just a small part of her day and warning she'd streak her makeup. Jacky Uljanic, the UH nurse practioner who turned wedding planner for the occasion, passed around tissues. Nagy kissed a rambunctious ringbearing grandson and gave a thumbs up. \\"It was a promise I made in March, to walk her down the aisle,\\" he said. \\"She's my princess. This is my definition of walking down the aisle.\\" Then, lying raised up on the gurney that carried him from the hospital, his gleaming black dress shoes pointing the way, he escorted Sarah to the altar to meet her groom, Angelo Salvatore. \\"Who gives this woman to be married to this man?\\" asked Pastor Chuck Knerem. We do, Nagy responded, her father and her mother. Family and friends who filled the church reddened their hands with clapping and their eyes with tears. \\"There are no guarantees in life,\\" Nagy said at the hospital. \\"This is a bonus.\\" Nagy, 56, of Brunswick, was diagnosed last November with metastatic urethral cancer, said his wife, herself a nurse practitioner. Chemotherapy slowed the cancer's growth, and Nagy was able to work full-time as an insurance claims adjuster until August. The wedding, originally set for next year, was moved up last March. \\"Somehow everything just fell into place for this date,\\" Jean said. \\"It's almost like it was just meant to be. The first night at the hospital, Scott said, 'Just remember, I have to be at my daughter's wedding in October.' He was a big part of this. He was at the bridal shower. He went shopping for her dress. There was no way he was not going to finish this out.\\" Moving the date for a big wedding was a struggle, said Sarah, 24, who teaches at Brunswick High School. \\"But it is what I wanted since I was a little girl, for my father to escort me down the aisle. My future husband said, 'You will get your wish.' \\" Nagy has been at UH since late August. Doctors were uncertain he'd have strength enough to make the wedding. But he was determined. \\"After Scott told us his goal, he was our inspiration,\\" Uljanic said. \\"It makes it all worth it.\\" She put him through daily therapy to build his strength for the event. She went to the church and met with the pastor to measure dimensions and plan logistics. She and nurse practitioner Julie Ray, both volunteering their time, stayed with Nagy through the day, monitoring his condition and handling details down to fastening his shirt studs. With nurse Brigitte Gaspar-Smith and Dr. Nick Pesa, they rode with him to the church. Paramedics Andrew Gorman and Melissa Powell volunteered their services for the ride donated by Physicians Medical Transport. So many details. His barber came to the hospital last week to trim Nagy's beard and hair. \\"It's taken a lot of people,\\" head nurse Laurie Joyce said. \\"He's done great.\\" \\"I love them all,\\" Nagy said. \\"I'm very excited we're able to make this happen.\\" He stayed to the end of the afternoon service, watching much from the back of the church. Outside afterward, next to the idling ambulance, he received guests and posed for pictures with the family that includes sons Ryan and Brad. \\"Kissing, kissing, kissing, kissing,\\" a photographer said, giving unneeded instruction. \\"Nice.\\" Saturday night's reception would have been too much for him to attempt, so arrangements were made for him to deliver the traditional toast via Skype from his hospital bed. Before his gurney was lifted into the ambulance for the ride back, Sarah asked what he planned to say. \\"You'll find out,\\" he said with a grin, his promise kept. |||||","completion":"A terminally ill father, Scott Nagy, suffering from metastatic urethral cancer, was able to escort his daughter down the aisle at her wedding with the help of a dedicated medical team and an all-volunteer hospital caravan.

The twist? There's no mention of Sergeant Thomas being involved in any of these incidents, leading to a mysterious and suspenseful search for the perpetrator. Act 1: Sergeant Thomas (ST) and his partner, Detective Jenny Martinez (JM), are assigned to a case involving an assault on a high-profile mafia figure, Vincent \\"The Snake\\" Moretti. Surprisingly, every witness and the initial evidence point towards an unknown assailant who's acting as a vigilante, using brutal tactics to take down criminals. Act 2: As they investigate the cases, ST and JM uncover more and more instances of criminals, including drug dealers, human traffickers, and corrupt officials, being violently attacked in a similar fashion. What's even more perplexing is the absence of ST's involvement, as though he's been purposely kept away from these crime scenes. The partners start to connect the dots, recognizing a pattern in the attacks and that the targeted victims were somehow connected to ST's past. They start investigating deeper into ST's background, including his time in the military, where they find hints suggesting he has a troubled past. Act 3: As the pieces start falling into place, ST and JM realize that the perpetrator is someone intimately familiar with ST's past and is using the assaults as a way to \\"right the wrongs\\" and seek justice for unsolved cases or victims affected by ST's previous actions. In a dramatic climax, they identify the vigilante as Michael, ST's estranged brother, who has taken matters into his own hands to fulfill what he perceives as ST's unfinished business. Act 4: Faced with the truth about Michael's actions, ST is forced to choose between upholding the law or protecting his family. The tensions finally culminate in a dangerous confrontation between ST, Michael, and the remaining criminals who are out for revenge after discovering the vigilante's identity. Act 5: In the end, ST, JM, and Michael work together to defeat the criminals but Michael, unable to escape from his past actions, ultimately turns himself in. ST learns to come to terms with his past and grows as a person, later becoming a mentor and advocate for preventing younger generations from experiencing the same hardships as his brother. The film ends with both brothers reconciling their past, and ST vowing to improve the system from within, while Michael finds hope in the possibility of redemption during his incarceration."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The text states that the National Brewing Company operated from 1872 until the late 1970s. It also mentions that the company was purchased at the end of the 1970s and that their breweries were shut down. This signifies that the original entity of the National Brewing Company ceased its operations, which is the basis for supporting the hypothesis that the company no longer exists. However, it is important to note that the company's two most prominent brands, National Bohemian Beer and Colt 45, were kept alive and are currently being brewed in Wisconsin.

So far, there have been seven attempts in the last two weeks, and numerous threats. One man is dead, another clings to life. The first one came on July 14 at a large Tel Aviv rally commemorating the first anniversary of the Israeli Occupy movement. Moshe Silman, a badly indebted Haifa resident entangled in what the daily newspaper Ha'aretz called \\"a bureaucratic nightmare,\\" distributed flyers to a few people around him, doused himself with lighter fluid and struck a match. He was burned over 90 percent of his body. The social justice movement, of which he was a part, waited out the eight-day vigil in shocked silence until he died. The idea of a man ostentatiously setting himself aflame is so alien here that many Israelis, and it would appear their entire government, have found themselves helpless and unsure how to react. On July 20, Labor Party leader Shelly Yachimovitch cautioned against self-immolations becoming an acceptable form of protest. \\"Taking one's own life is an extreme and awful act and it cannot be idealized,\\" she said. More from GlobalPost: Israel: Self-immolation sends shock through protests (VIDEO) On the very same day — a day after Silman's funeral — two others attempted to set themselves alight. The afternoon before, Akiva Mafa'i, a 45-year-old wounded war veteran had set himself on fire at a bus stop in his hometown of Yehud. He remains in critical condition. Mafa'i was wheelchair-bound, and though not destitute, had told his close circle that he could no longer face the almost impregnable thicket of paperwork demanded by the welfare authorities. He had not worked since his injury, which took place almost 20 years ago. His siblings said Mafa'i felt he had nowhere to turn. Israel Police Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the phenomenon of self-immolations is \\"not a spate, maybe a wave or a trend.\\" Since Silman's death and Mafa'i's self-destructive act, Israelis in cities as diverse as Ofakim, a poor desert town, Be'er Sheva, Tel Aviv and the posh suburb of Petach Tikva, have attempted this particular form of suicide. \\"It’s a wave, nothing more than a wave,\\" Rosenfeld said. \\"Israel Police is dealing with the social protests that are taking place on a regular basis, every weekend, with the aim of making sure no public disturbances or extreme acts take place by anyone who may want to harm themselves.\\" \\"Every time we get a phone call about anyone with any intent whatsoever to hurt him or herself we respond quickly.\\" More from GlobalPost: Israel's protest movement erupts again Israeli suicide prevention hotlines have been swamped. Eran, an emotional first aid hotline, reported a 25 percent increase in calls in the last two weeks. In Israel, the national health care system covers emotional distress but it is common to wait for months before being granted an appointment with a mental health professional. \\"People in these cases just want to stop the pain,” said Dr. Shiri Daniels, Eran's director of counseling. “In a situation of crisis, you see everything in black and white, you're trapped in an emotional storm and the only way to stop the pain is to stop living.\\" The self-immolations, she said, represent \\"an illusion that some people have decided to copy. But it is not a rational decision. It is the depression speaking.\\" More from GlobalPost: Israel's Tea Party On Friday, one of the grand old men of Israeli journalism decided to attempt a response. Eitan Haber, a veteran journalist and formerly the chief of staff for Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin, wrote an op-ed entitled For God's Sake, Stop. It’s as if a local Walter Cronkite had decided to address the matter. \\"This is a last call to the despaired who intend to commit suicide: For God’s sake, stop! Stop it!\\" Haber exhorts. \\"Before you douse your clothes with drops of fuel, before you touch that matchbox, stop for a moment and imagine your broken parents, your shattered wife and your child, whose taste of life will always be bitter.\\" Dr. Daniels, from the suicide hotline, said there is something demonstrative about these acts. “You sense the desire to create an effect,” she said. “On the other hand, you know, they just didn't think. All they want is to stop the pain and to transmit a message. It’s a psychological and sociological tempest.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In recent weeks, Israel has experienced a wave of self-immolations, with seven attempts and countless threats, deeply affecting both the public and authorities. The first incident occurred during a social protest in Tel Aviv, where Moshe Silman set himself alight and later died from his injuries.

This trend has left the government unsure of how to respond, while mental health professionals and suicide prevention hotlines are overwhelmed with calls.

Write a dialog based on this summary: Ivan, Vasily and Dimitri are concerned about the current political situation in Ukraine and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine..","completion":"Ivan: Hey, Vasily, Dimitri, have you guys been following the news lately? The political situation in Ukraine seems to be intensifying. Vasily: You're right, Ivan. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is becoming very concerning. With the annexation of Crimea and the ongoing disputes in Eastern Ukraine, it seems like things are only getting worse. Dimitri: Absolutely. The situation in Ukraine has been unstable for a long time now. In fact, it's been like this since the 2014 Ukrainian revolution. There have been numerous casualties on both sides, and I'm worried that it might escalate further. Ivan: Well, it all started back when former Ukrainian President Yanukovych decided not to sign the EU Association Agreement and instead, opted for closer ties with Russia. This created a divide amongst Ukrainians and led to the Euromaidan protests which ultimately resulted in his ousting. Vasily: True, and the annexation of Crimea by Russia only exacerbated the situation. Many saw it as a blatant violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. It's difficult to imagine a resolution anytime soon, especially with the ongoing fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Dimitri: Yeah, and let's not forget that there's a significant Russian-speaking population in Eastern Ukraine. Many of these people feel more connected to Russia than Ukraine. This makes it even more challenging to find common ground between both sides. Ivan: That's a great point, Dimitri. It's really a delicate and complicated situation. The world has reacted to Russia's actions, with sanctions being imposed by the EU, the US, and other countries. Russia has been experiencing economic difficulties as a result, but they don't seem to be backing down. Vasily: It's also worth mentioning that NATO has been supporting Ukraine with training and equipment. This is seen by Russia as a direct threat to their own security. They've repeatedly expressed their concern about NATO's expansion towards their borders and this conflict seems to be putting more strain on the relationship between Russia and the West. Dimitri: Indeed, Vasily. There's also a lot of underlying historical and cultural context that plays into this conflict. Ukraine is a country with deep-rooted ties to both European and Russian societies, but they're struggling to find their own identity and path moving forward. Ivan: You're right, Dimitri. It's definitely difficult for Ukraine to navigate their way through this. I think there's a genuine desire amongst Ukrainians for a better future, free from corruption and socio-political unrest. But right now, it's just so hard for them to break away from the longstanding issues and conflicts. Vasily: I agree, and it's so easy for us to feel overwhelmed and helpless as we watch these events unfold. I truly hope that in time, both sides can find a peaceful resolution and work together for a better future for all Ukrainians. Dimitri: That's the best we can hope for, Vasily. But until then, it's crucial for us to stay informed, engaged, and to support any initiatives aimed at bringing peace and stability to the region. We must continue our dialogue, sharing our perspectives, and advocating for peace in any way we can. Ivan: Absolutely, my friends. We should all do our part in fostering global understanding and peace. Our hope for a better world starts with discussions like this and our continued concern for those affected by conflicts around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"Tourists riding a double decker bus with people watching them from an office window.\\" true if \\"The people in the office only have a view of the river.\\"?","completion":"To tackle this problem, we need to assess if both scenarios can coexist based on the information given. Step 1: Analyze the first premise. Here it states \\"Tourists riding a double decker bus with people watching them from an office window.\\" There are no inherent contradictions in this part. Step 2: Analyze the second premise. It states \\"The people in the office only have a view of the river.\\" Step 3: Compare the two premises. For the first premise to be true, the office window should have a view that includes the street, not specifically the river, to watch tourists on a double-decker bus. On the other hand, the second premise stipulates that the people in the office only have a view of the river. Conclusion: Thus, given that the view from the office window is exclusively of the river and does not include the street where the double-decker bus could potentially be, the first premise \\"Tourists riding a double-decker bus with people watching them from an office window\\" cannot be true as per the given conditions in the second premise.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"there are three parts to the GPS\\" is correct. According to the passage, the Global Positioning System (GPS) consists of three main components: the receiver, satellites, and ground stations. The receiver is the handheld device, or it can be integrated into various modes of transportation, such as cars, planes, or boats. The satellites are a group orbiting the Earth, with the receiver contacting at least four of them to calculate its position. Lastly, the ground stations are situated all over the world and are responsible for controlling the satellites and ensuring their proper functioning. The passage also highlights the increasing affordability and accuracy of GPS devices, their incorporation into various forms of technology like watches and phones, and the possibility that they will become as commonplace as mobile phones in the future. This would potentially result in a future where everyone has a GPS device, and the issue of getting lost is effectively eliminated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An American couple convicted in Qatar of child endangerment has spoken out about their situation. Parents Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles will receive a final verdict on their appeal on November 30, a Qatari judge announced October 20. The Huangs, of Los Angeles, were originally jailed on murder charges following the January 2013 death of their adopted daughter Gloria. The Huangs recently spoke to Katie Couric in an interview for Yahoo! News. 'I believe that the authorities in Qatar suspected foul play because we are Asians and we adopted three children from Africa, who are black, and this country does not understand adoptions,' Matthew Huang said during the interview. Scroll down for video. Parents: Grace and Matthew Huang are appealing their child endangerment conviction with the Qatari government - and the prosecution has also appealed, asking for the death penalty. Murder? The prosecution alleged that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said the child was locked in her room at night. Grace Huang further explained, 'It's just not done here. They don't even have a word for adoption. I was asked over and over whether I was the \\"real mom.\\"' Yahoo News! reported that 'authorities arrested the couple and accused them of killing their daughter in order to sell her body parts on the black market.' The Huangs were released from prison last November, but banned from leaving during the trial. In March, the court sentenced them to three years in prison for child endangerment. Speaking about their imprisonment, Grace Huang said in the Yahoo! News interview 'It was incomprehensible to us. We were put in prison and taken back and forth to court every two weeks and we did not understand what was happening. Things were not translated. I was not allowed to see Matt or the kids.' The Huangs have remained out of prison during their appeal. They have insisted that their daughter, who was born in Ghana, died of medical problems complicated by unusual eating habits. However, Matthew Huang said in the Yahoo News! interview 'A lot of her struggles were from malnourishment from when she was younger.' At one point, Matthew Huang said in interview 'We appealed our three-year sentence, and so we are in an appeals court. The government prosecution appealed our three-year sentence and is requesting a death penalty, so we have been tried again on the same charges as we were before.' Appeal: Matthew and Grace Huang of Los Angeles will receive a final verdict on their appeal on November 30. The case has raised concerns about possible cultural misunderstandings in Qatar, where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare. Grace Huang then said to Couric 'I can relate to you not understanding the purposes of these hearings, because a lot of times I don't, we don't, understand why it just keeps going, and going, and going and going and they keep bringing the same things up over and over again, the same things happen over and over again. It just has no end.' Matthew Huang earlier told reporters outside the courtroom on October 20 'It feels like there is no end to this. The Qatar government is ignoring the calls of the U.S. government for our release.' Matthew Huang also spoke of a fear of being outside during his interview with Couric. 'I'm fearful of this country, I'm fearful of the government. I feel trapped and I don't trust that this government is able to do the right thing.' He also spoke of a fear of reprisal for giving the interview. 'I'm very fearful,' he told Couric. 'I'm scared of this court. I'm fearful of many things and I'm scared. I'm scared of this court. I'm scared of what the authorities might do to us.' Family: The couple has two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the United States. The couple has two other African-born adopted children who left Qatar during the trial to live with relatives in the United States. Washington has urged its Gulf ally to lift their travel ban. The couple met with U.S. Ambassador to Qatar Dana Shell Smith on October 19. The prosecution alleged that the couple had denied food to Gloria and said the child was locked in her room at night. The girl was pronounced dead when the Huangs took her to the hospital in January 2013. The case has raised concerns about possible cultural misunderstandings in Qatar, where Western-style adoptions and cross-cultural families are relatively rare. An investigative report by the Qatari police had focused partially on why the Huangs would adopt children who did not share their 'hereditary traits', according to the family's website. The Huangs will be able to take their case to a higher court after the appeals verdict, though Qatar's highest judicial body traditionally rules in favor of the lower court's rulings.

In this context, the person's laughter is at odds with the expected emotional tone and behavior, making it unsuitable or \\"inappropriate\\" for the occasion. Let's break it down by looking at the other options as well: - Sadness: This option focuses on the emotion but does not describe the person's action itself or its relation to the general atmosphere of the event. - Disenchanted: This word means feeling disappointed by someone or something one previously respected, and it does not accurately describe the reaction or behavior of the person in question. - Unfortunate: While laughter during a funeral might be considered unfortunate, this term does not specifically capture the misalignment between the expected behavior and the person's action; it is often used for situations beyond our control, which is not the case here. - Funny: This word describes something amusing and likely to provoke laughter; in this context, it does not capture the discord between the laughter and the event's tone.

As a child, she read the financial pages of the newspaper to her rich father. Her father died when Hetty was 30, and she inherited 1 million. When she herself died in 1916, she left almost 100 million to her two children. Hetty made her money on the New York stock exchange. She was a financial genius. She made money so easily that people called her the Witch of Wall Street. But although she was one of the richest women in the world, she counted every cent and spent as little as possible. She didn't own a house, because she didn't want to pay taxes. So she and her children lived in cheap hotels. She spent almost nothing on clothes, and always wore the same long black dress. She washed it herself, but to save soap she only washed the bottom of the dress, where it touched the ground. Other people had their own offices, but Hetty used a desk in the bank where she kept her money, because it didn't cost anything. She sat in the bank and ate her sandwiches while she bought and sold stocks and shares. If the bank complained, she just moved all her money to another bank. Hetty's family paid the price for her meanness. When she was 33 she married a millionaire, Edward Green, and they had two children. But Green lost all his money, so she left him. When her son, Ned, injured his knee, Hetty didn't want to pay for a doctor, so she took him to a free hospital for poor people. Unfortunately the doctor knew Hetty was rich and he asked for money. Hetty refused and took the boy away. His leg got worse and two years later doctors removed it. But eventually Ned got his revenge . At the age of 81, Hetty had an argument with a shop assistant about the price of a bottle of milk. She became so angry that she had a heart attack and died. So Hetty's meanness finally killed her. Ned inherited half his mother's fortune, and he spent it all on parties, holidays and expensive jewellery. Question: Which of the following best describes Hetty Robinson? Answer: Answer:","completion":"Hetty Robinson can best be described as a frugal and financially astute woman who was known for her incredible ability to make money, yet displayed extreme reluctance to spend it.

Despite being one of the richest women in the world, she was known to count every cent, avoid owning a house to save on taxes, and spent minimally on clothes and other necessities.

Based on the given premise, it is not possible to conclusively determine if the hypothesis \\"The people that need help the most don't get it due to ineligibility\\" is true. The premise states that ineligible persons who do participate are mostly near-poor and may be eligible under non-LSC (Legal Services Corporation) funding programs such as IOLTA (Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts) and Administration on Aging. It is important to analyze the premise more closely to understand why we cannot conclusively determine the truth of the hypothesis. 1. The premise acknowledges that ineligible persons do participate in the program. This implies a level of access to help despite ineligibility. However, it does not provide information on why they are ineligible or the extent to which they need help compared to those who are eligible. 2. The premise states that the majority of ineligible persons participating are near-poor. This suggests that these individuals may have some financial need, but it does not clarify if their need is greater than those who are eligible. The term \\"near-poor\\" is also not explicitly defined, making it difficult to compare their level of need to eligible participants. 3. The premise mentions that ineligible persons may be eligible for help through other funding programs. This indicates that, even if they are ineligible for LSC-funded programs, they may still have access to valuable resources. It is unclear how these other programs compare in terms of quality and effectiveness, leaving the question of whether they receive enough help open. In conclusion, while the premise suggests that there may be some individuals who need help but face barriers due to ineligibility, it does not provide enough information to definitively answer the question. Further investigation would be required to determine the extent of need among ineligible persons compared to eligible participants and if alternative funding sources adequately address their needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your job is to determine which passage can be used to answer the question by searching for further information using terms from the passage. Indicate your choice as 1, 2, or 3. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: How old was Robert Guiscard when he defeated the papal troops of Pope Leo IX? Passage 1:The movement of Protestant Reformation, led by Martin Luther in the Holy Roman Empire and John Calvin in France, had an important impact on music in Paris. Under Calvin's direction, between 1545 and 1550 books of psalms were translated from Latin into French, turned into songs, and sung at reformed services in Paris. The Catholic establishment reacted fiercely to the new movement; the songs were condemned by the College of Sorbonne, the fortress of orthodoxy, and in 1549 one Protestant tailor in Paris, Jacques Duval, was burned at the stake, along with his song book. When the campaign against the new songs proved ineffective, the Catholic Church, at the Council of Trent (1545-1563) which launched the Counter-Reformation, also launched a musical counter-reformation. It was calling for an end to complex but unintelligible chants, simpler melodies, and more serious and elevated lyrics. Passage 2:San Severo lies on the Daunia, and various Neolithic settlements have been detected. In the early Middle Ages, the area was not inhabited or defined. Between the Lombards and the Byzantine ages, the Benedictine monastery at Cassino was established, and with it, the cult of the apostle of Saint Severinus of Noricum. San Severo was founded in the 11th century around a small church built by the Benedictine monks from Montecassino. It rapidly developed as a trade town. In 1053, it was the scene of the historical victory of Robert Guiscard over the papal troops under Pope Leo IX (see Battle of Civitate). In the eleventh century, San Severo was the route of the Via Sacra Langobardorum and a primitive church arose dedicated to Saint Severino, from which continued an influx of pilgrims to Monte Sant'Angelo and movement of people and goods. The town was therefore called Castellum Sancti Severini (\\"Fortified Town of San Severo\\"). Passage 3:Parkinson divorced in 1952 and he married the writer and journalist Ann Fry (1921–1983), with whom he had two sons and a daughter. In 1958, while still in Singapore, he published his most famous work, Parkinson's Law, which expanded upon a humorous article that he had published in the Economist magazine in November 1955, satirising government bureaucracies. The 120-page book of short studies, published in the United States and then in Britain, was illustrated by Osbert Lancaster and became an instant best seller. It explained the inevitability of bureaucratic expansion, arguing that 'work expands to fill the time available for its completion'. Typical of his satire and cynical humour, it included a discourse on Parkinson's Law of Triviality (debates about expenses for a nuclear plant, a bicycle shed, and refreshments), a note on why driving on the left side of the road (see road transport) is natural, and suggested that the Royal Navy would eventually have more admirals than ships. After serving as visiting professor at Harvard University in 1958, the University of Illinois and the University of California, Berkeley in 1959–60, he resigned his post in Singapore to become an independent writer. To avoid high taxation in Britain, he moved to the Channel Islands and settled at St Martin's, Guernsey, where he purchased Les Caches Hall and later restored Annesville Manor. His writings from this period included a series of historical novels featuring a fictional naval officer from Guernsey, Richard Delancey, during the Napoleonic era.

To find the age of Robert Guiscard when he defeated the papal troops, I would need to search for additional information such as his birth year and then calculate his age during the battle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bears began their 2008 season by recording an upset victory over the Indianapolis Colts at the newly opened Lucas Oil Stadium. The team won the Super Bowl XLI rematch, by a score of 29-13. The Bears offensive attack featured the debut of rookie running back Matt Fort&#233;, becoming the first Bears rookie running back to start a game since Walter Payton in 1975, coincidentally against the Baltimore Colts (Anthony Thomas also started as a running back for the Bears in 2001). Forte carried the ball 23 times for 123 yards, including a 50-yard touchdown run. The Colts and Bears exchanged field goals, and then Joseph Addai was dropped for a safety. A Robbie Gould 25-yard field goal on the following drive ended the 1st half. Peyton Manning helped the Colts narrow their deficit by throwing a six-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne. Later in the 3rd quarter, Bears cornerback Charles Tillman forced a fumble, which Lance Briggs picked up and returned for a 21-yard touchdown. The Bears defense was able to contain the Colts the rest of the way, including a key fourth down and one yard stop near midfield early in the fourth quarter. The Bears essentially sealed their victory with 8:56 left on a one-yard touchdown run by fullback Jason McKie. After the game, Al Michaels and John Madden awarded Forte with the Sunday Night Football's \\"Horse Trailer Player of the Game\\" award.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - juggling - trees - chess set - flying - castle A:","completion":"The most suitable option is \\"castle.\\" If a child is referring to a rook as something other than its proper name in a chess set, it might be because the child is calling it a castle. This is actually a common informal name for the piece, given its resemblance to the appearance of a castle turret. The rook is a vital piece in the game of chess, representing a castle or a tower, and is typically placed on the corners of the board at the start of the game. Its movements include horizontal and vertical lines, and it can move any number of squares along a straight line within the limits of the 8x8 board. This movement can be very powerful, especially when paired with other pieces, and the rook can control a significant portion of the playing area. The terminology of a \\"castle\\" might be confusing or intriguing for a child learning about the different pieces in a chess set. To provide more context, the origins of this word choice might be attributed to the historical transformation of the game over time. Chess has roots dating back to 6th-century India and has undergone significant changes to adapt to the many cultures it has permeated. As it evolved, the rook piece transformed from being represented by a chariot in ancient India to taking the form of a castle or a tower in medieval Europe. In addition to the connection between the rook's appearance and the name \\"castle,\\" the term is further reinforced by the chess move known as \\"castling.\\" This specific move allows a player to relocate their king and a rook simultaneously, enhancing the king's safety and mobilizing the rook to be more active in the game. To sum it up, if a child is calling a rook a \\"castle,\\" it could be due to the informal name and visual association between the piece and a castle turret. This association helps them understand the role of the rook in the game of chess and its historical significance in the evolution of the game. It's important to educate them on the piece's proper name and explain the significance of the castle-like appearance so that they can better grasp the strategic importance of the rook and recognize its uniqueness within the chess set."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Victoria wants to help Angela to harvest cashews, because","completion":"Victoria knows that Angela could greatly benefit from the extra aid. Cashew farming than meets the eye, as it involves numerous labor-intensive steps that require knowledge, precision, and strength. Victoria holds this understanding deep in her core, inspiring her to lend a helping hand to her dear friend. Firstly, the process of cashew farming starts with the planting of seeds. Each tree requires a specific amount of spacing to allow for growth and development. This initial setup can be strenuous, particularly when you're dealing with a large plantation like Angela's. This is one area where Victoria believes she can be of great help. Secondly, the art of harvesting cashews demands careful picking and handling. The fruit is encased in a shell that is harmful if mishandled, making it necessary to properly train individuals for the harvesting process. This would generally involve the use of specialized gloves and tools to safely remove the nuts without any harm. Victoria, with her background in agricultural safety protocols, can assist in ensuring the proper safety measures are in place. Thirdly, after the collection, the cashews are then subjected to several phases of processing. These include drying, shelling, peeling, grading, and packaging. Each of these steps requires a degree of precision and patience to ensure that the cashews are kept in optimal condition. Victoria, being detail-oriented, believes that Angela could definitely use her meticulous nature to ensure the quality of her cashews. Fourthly, there is the aspect of marketing the product. Given the rise in demand for cashews worldwide due to their nutritional values and versatile use in various dishes, Angela might find it challenging to navigate through the business landscape alone. Victoria, having some background in marketing and networking, could introduce Angela to the right market segments and potential business partnerships, which could increase the value of her product significantly. Finally, it is also critical to handle the byproducts of cashew processing responsibly. Sustainability is something that Victoria prioritizes, and she believes in imparting these values to Angela for their mutual goal of reducing environmental impact. In summary, Victoria wants to help Angela harvest cashews, not just because they are friends, but also because she believes that her input can significantly optimize and expedite the process while ensuring safety, quality, and sustainability. They do say \\"many hands make light work\\", and Victoria is determined to prove that together, they can do more than just grow cashews – they can build a thriving, sustainable business."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: What Democratic party member signed the Hawaii Marriage Equality Act?

A man said that his ex-wife, 35-year-old Connie Villa, had stabbed him but that he had managed to escape and was driving himself to a hospital. When officers arrived at the home, they found Villa with stab wounds, holding a knife to her chest. They managed to subdue her and conducted a sweep of the home.

Connie Villa reportedly told investigators she wanted to kill her children and ex-husband because she did not want him to have custody of them. The surviving children are all in good condition and were placed with the family of their father, Adam Villa, 33. He is in stable condition.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Hello, little buddy! Let me explain the answers for your questions. Question 1: Gary Johnson won't win the 2016 presidency race. This past contest was between two other candidates - Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. And guess what? Donald Trump won that election, so Johnson couldn’t get the prize. Question 2: Now, why didn't Gary Johnson have a chance to win back in 2016? Well, you see, candidate Gary Johnson was from the Libertarian Party, but the U.S. mainly focuses on two big parties - The Democrats and The Republicans - like the red and blue teams. The Libertarian Party is more like the purple team, and not many people choose to support the purple team, because the red and blue teams are way more popular. So, even though the two questions look a bit different, the answers to them are similar in that they both say Gary Johnson did not and could not win the 2016 presidency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His choice of films, the basic 'conceit' of the production (which places him in the sets or simulacra of the films he is commenting on ) and his delivery are brilliant! But if you want Freud, be aware that you're getting Zizek's version of Lacan, which should not be confused with Lacan himself. As usual, Zizek delivers complex ideas with gusto and in a convincing manner. The rub is he is also quite mercurial and so there may be more in his gusto than in actual content.

If you’re unable to boot your computer and don’t have a recovery drive, you can download installation media from Microsoft and create your own installation disc or flash drive. You’ll need either a blank USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of storage OR a blank DVD (Dual Layer preferred) and DVD burner drive. If you’re using a laptop, make sure you plug it into a power source before starting the installation. It’s the blue button near the center of the page. A file manager window will appear. It may take several minutes for the download to complete. It’s called “MediaCreationTool1809.exe” (the number at the end may vary). It should be in the Downloads folder. You may have to click Yes or Allow to run the tool. After a few seconds, you’ll be asked what you want to do. Windows 10 will now download to the computer. This downloads additional updates for the installation media. You’ll be prompted to select the type of media you’re creating (USB flash drive or DVD), and then walked through the media creation process. Once the media is created, remove the drive or DVD from the working computer. Connect the USB flash drive or insert the DVD, depending on the type of media you created. If the computer was already on, reboot it now that the USB drive is attached (or DVD is inserted). The PC will boot from the inserted media and start the install process. The options may vary depending on your location. If you don’t see any option to select a language or modify other Windows settings, you may need to edit the BIOS so the PC knows to boot from the media. See Set Your Computer to Boot from USB Flash Drive#Boot from the Flash Drive to learn how.

The remaining steps will walk you through the installation process. You’ll be asked if you want to format the hard drive in addition to reinstalling—this is up to you, but it’s typically only necessary if you’re going to be giving the computer to someone else.
