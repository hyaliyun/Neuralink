Article: Today is Sarah's birthday. She is seventy-five. We asked a few old friends to dinner. Like most elderly people, I suppose, we spent most of the evening talking about old times. Thirty years ago, the village used to be a quiet place. Now it has changed. Every Sunday hundreds of cars pass through the village at what I think a dangerous speed. They make the village almost as noisy as the streets of a large town. As a boy I enjoyed riding on the backs of the farm horses. Things are different now. Today there are very few horses working on the farms. The farm workers today drive tractors, not horses. A man is not of much use on a farm unless he knows all about machines. Now almost every house in the village has a TV set. Is it a good thing for children to spend the evening sitting in front of a TV set? When I was young I did not waste my time indoors. I would spend the long summer evenings outdoors. I would play with my friends, go fishing or walk by the river. When my grandchildren asked me the reason why I haven't bought a TV set, I tell them there are many books I still want to read. I can't find time for both reading and watching TV.

There are only 3-4 pages on how to breastfeed, and the information on those pages is very basic. There is very little advice on good positioning and good latching, both of which are absolutely vital to breastfeeding.

Step 3: Analyze the overall tone and specific details mentioned in the review. The tone is critical, and the reviewer has listed a few specific issues they had with the book, such as the lack of information on breastfeeding, positioning, and latching. Step 4: Compare the reviewer's sentiment and tone with what constitutes a positive review. A positive review typically has a favorable opinion, a positive tone, and would mention the positive aspects of the product. Step 5: Make a conclusion based on the analyzed information.

Their village is attacked by Khalar Zym, a warlord who wishes to reunite the pieces of the Mask of Acheron to revive his dead wife and conquer Hyboria.

He allows himself to be captured alongside Ela-Shan. Conan escapes imprisonment, kills several of the guards, and confronts Lucius, forcing him to reveal that Zym seeks a girl, the pure-blood descendant of the sorcerers of Acheron; sacrificing the descendant and using blood from the body of the girl will unleash the mask's power. Conan helps the rest of the prisoners to escape, and, in gratitude, Ela-Shan tells Conan that, if he ever needs him, Conan will find him at the City of Thieves, Argalon.

Now you are ready to crack and enjoy!","completion":"Option b makes more sense to accomplish the goal of boiling eggs and prepping them for egg salad. To summarize, here's the detailed process: 1. Place the eggs in a pot: Lay the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a saucepan or pot. Make sure not to overcrowd the eggs, giving them enough space to cook evenly. 2. Fill the pot with water: Fill the pot with enough cold water to submerge the eggs completely, with approximately an inch of water above the eggs. This ensures that they are fully surrounded by water and cook evenly. 3. Bring the water to a boil: Turn on the heat to medium-high and bring the water to a rolling boil. To prevent cracking, you may add a pinch of salt to the water, which can also help with the peeling process later. 4. Cover and boil the eggs: Once the water is at a rolling boil, cover the pot and let the eggs cook for 2-3 minutes. This will provide enough heat to cook the eggs through. 5. Turn off the heat and let the eggs sit: After boiling for 2-3 minutes, remove the pot from the heat source and let the eggs sit in the hot water, still covered, for 12-13 minutes. This ensures that the eggs reach the desired consistency for egg salad without overcooking. 6. Stop the cooking process: Pour out the hot water from the pot and immediately rinse the eggs with cold water. Add ice to create an ice bath for the eggs; this will quickly lower their temperature and halt the cooking process. 7. Let the eggs sit in the ice bath: Allow the eggs to sit in the ice bath for around 10 minutes. This will not only help to stop the cooking process but also make peeling the eggs easier. 8. Peel and prepare the eggs: Once the eggs have cooled, tap and roll them on a hard surface to crack the shell, then carefully peel the shell away.

Elio Petri (1929 – 1982) was an Italian film director, screenwriter, and producer who worked primarily in the Italian film industry. He was known for his distinctive, provocative directing style that often delved into political and social issues within Italian society. He started his career as a film critic in the late 1940s and later progressed to writing screenplays for noted Italian filmmakers. His directorial debut came in the early 1960s with the film \\"L'assassino\\" (The Assassin), which showcased his creative abilities and unique approach. Petri's most acclaimed work, \\"Indagine su un cittadino al di sopra di ogni sospetto\\" (Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion), earned him widespread recognition and numerous awards, including an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1970. This film, like many of his other works, delved deeply into the themes of power, politics, and moral ambiguity, challenging the status quo and encouraging audiences to critically examine the world around them. Ralph Smart (1908 – 2001) was an English-Australian film and television director, screenwriter, and producer, who began his career in the British film industry during the 1930s. He then moved to Australia, where he primarily focused on producing and directing television shows. Smart's early work included contributions to the landmark British documentary series, \\"The March of Time,\\" as well as numerous wartime propaganda films aimed at boosting morale and encouraging patriotism during World War II. In the 1950s, Smart transitioned to television production, where he was instrumental in developing and directing several series such as \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" and \\"The Invisible Man\\" for British television. He is perhaps best known for creating and producing the popular espionage series \\"Danger Man\\" (also known as \\"Secret Agent\\" in the United States) starring Patrick McGoohan, which originally aired in the 1960s. While Elio Petri and Ralph Smart worked in different countries and cultures, both shared an occupation as film directors, screenwriters, and producers, leaving a significant impact on their respective industries and audiences through their work. Their contributions to the world of film and television have undoubtedly left a lasting impression and continue to influence filmmakers and storytellers today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To answer the question, it is important to provide some background information on the Richmond International Raceway and the Capital City 400 event. The Richmond International Raceway, currently known as the Richmond Raceway, is a 3/4-mile D-shaped asphalt racetrack located in Richmond, Virginia. It has a seating capacity of around 51,000 and is owned by the International Speedway Corporation. The Capital City 400 is a NASCAR Cup Series race that has been held at the Richmond Raceway in various forms since the track's early days. The race is currently called the Toyota Owners 400, following multiple title changes and sponsorships over the years. The race is typically held under the lights at night on a Saturday in the spring, and serves as an important lead-up to the annual NASCAR playoffs. The RIR began to host the Capital City 400 in the early 1960s, with the first Capital City 400 race taking place on April 23, 1961. Joe Weatherly won the inaugural event by driving a 1961 Pontiac owned by Bud Moore. Since then, the race has seen many iconic racing moments, and NASCAR legends like Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt, and Jeff Gordon, among others, have all earned victories at the historic race. In summary, the Richmond International Raceway began to host the Capital City 400 in April 1961.

Help as much as you can. Michael and Robert are two patients at a cardiology clinic. Both just received their blood test results and were told that they need to improve their cholesterol levels. They were each recommended to begin exercising regularly. Michael took this advice to heart, and began regular aerobic exercise every week. Robert, on the other hand, only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks. Who is more likely to have LDL cholesterol build up in the inner walls of their arteries? Hint: Cholesterol can't dissolve in the blood. It has to be transported to and from the cells by carriers called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, is known as \\"bad\\" cholesterol. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is known as good cholesterol. When too much LDL cholesterol circulates in the blood, it can slowly build up in the inner walls of the arteries that feed the heart and brain. Together with other substances, it can form plaque, and lead to atherosclerosis. If a clot forms and blocks a narrowed artery, a heart attack or stroke can result. Cholesterol comes from the food you eat as well as being made by the body. To lower bad cholesterol, a diet low in saturated fat and dietary cholesterol should be followed. Regular aerobic exercise also lowers LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol.","completion":"Based on the information provided, Michael is more likely to have a lower risk of LDL cholesterol build-up in the inner walls of his arteries compared to Robert. This is because Michael has been performing regular aerobic exercise every week, which is known to help lower LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) and increase HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol). On the other hand, Robert only performs aerobic exercise every couple of weeks, which may not be as effective in managing cholesterol levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is my detailed explanation for this rating: 1. Conciseness: While the review is concise and to the point, it is too brief to provide substantial or meaningful insight into the software's specific features or capabilities. There is a potential for improvement in this area for the user to have shared more specific details. 2. Positivity: The review conveys a positive sentiment towards the software by using the words \\"very good,\\" indicating that the user was satisfied with the product. This positive tone is in line with a favorable rating of 5 out of 5. 3. Clarity: As mentioned earlier, the review is too brief to offer significant insight into the software's functions or features, leaving potential customers with little information to make informed decisions. This lack of clarity could be addressed with a more in-depth and informative review, reducing the overall rating for clarity to a 2 out of 5. 4.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a new situation: Danny owned two parcels of land. parcel A had a soil with high salinity levels, while parcel B had a rich and healthy soil. But I can use this background: A plant's first line of defense against abiotic stress is in its roots. If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied... What is an answer for this question: Which parcel had more plants which presented a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell?","completion":"Based on the information provided, parcel A, with the soil having high salinity levels, has more plants that would present a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cells. High salinity levels increase the concentration of Na+ ions in the soil, which can disrupt the Na+/K+ balance in plant cells, leading to negative effects on their water uptake and enzymatic functions. On the contrary, parcel B has rich and healthy soil, meaning the plants on this land are less likely to face high salinity stress which would cause disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 11:13 EST, 5 July 2013 | UPDATED: 14:53 EST, 5 July 2013 A journalist has lost the libel lawsuit she filed against a rival station after they aired footage of her in a bikini at a pool party at the home of a man who is a person of interest in the case of his wife's disappearance. Amy Jacobson was an on-air reporter for Chicago's NBC affiliate when the local CBS station aired footage of her lounging at a July 6, 2007 pool party at the home of Craig Stebic. Craig's wife Lisa disappeared in April 2007 and he refused to speak to police for much of the investigation. After her disappearance, friends and neighbors told of how","completion":"Lisa had confided in them about her troubled marriage and her fears for her own safety. She had confided in Amy, a seasoned journalist, known for her empathetic nature when dealing with cases involving missing persons. Amy had covered many high-profile stories where families had struggled with the aftermath of the inexplicable absence of their loved ones. Amy's approach towards the Stebics had always been professional, and she had interviewed Lisa's friends and family members extensively in an attempt to keep the public's attention on the missing mother of two. Unbeknownst to Amy, a fellow reporter from the local CBS station had received an invitation to the same pool party by another guest at the gathering. The reporter had managed to capture Amy on video at the event, wearing a bikini and seemingly enjoying herself. The footage quickly made its rounds on local and national news, along with various social media platforms, tainting Amy's image as a serious journalist. Consequently, Amy's credibility as a journalist was put into question, and she subsequently lost her job at the NBC affiliate. She decided to file a libel lawsuit against the CBS station, claiming that the footage was taken out of context and had unfairly portrayed her as unprofessional, damaging her reputation as a dedicated journalist. During the course of the trial, Amy's legal team presented evidence showing that she had been working diligently on the Lisa Stebic case, had multiple off-camera interviews with those close to the family, and had attended several press conferences raising awareness for her disappearance. They sought to demonstrate that the pool party was an informal social gathering with people from the neighborhood, arguing that it was her attempt to build rapport and gather more information about the case in a less formal setting. Moreover, Amy testified that she had been invited to the party by one of Lisa's friends, who believed she should be present in order to speak with Craig and glean new leads on Lisa's whereabouts. The prosecution, on the other hand, argued that the footage spoke for itself and that Amy's presence at the party in a bikini was unprofessional and inappropriate, given the sensitive nature of the case. In the end, the jury on the libel case found in favor of the CBS station, stating that although Amy's journalistic integrity was not put into question, her decision to attend the pool party in a bikini and the subsequent fallout that followed was a consequence of the choices she made of her own free will. Following the conclusion of the lawsuit, Amy expressed her disappointment with the ruling and reiterated her dedication to her reporting career. She said that even though the outcome was unfavorable, she would continue to advocate for missing persons, such as Lisa Stebic, and seek justice for their families. In the years following the lawsuit, Amy went on to work at a smaller news outlet, where she has continued to focus on uncovering the truth about unsolved cases. Despite the painful setback in her career, she remains driven by her commitment to giving a voice to the voiceless and standing up for those who are no longer here to stand up for themselves. As for the case of Lisa Stebic, it remains unsolved, with her family and friends continuing their search for answers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There are several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross, mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive cycling events.

The format of BMX was derived from motocross racing. BMX bicycle races are sprint races on purpose-built off-road single-lap race tracks. The track usually consists of a starting gate for up to eight racers, a groomed, serpentine, dirt race course made of various jumps and rollers and a finish line. The course is usually flat, about wide and has large banked corners that help the riders maintain speed. The sport of BMX racing is facilitated by a number of regional and international sanctioning bodies. They provide rules for sanctioning the conduct of the flying, specify age group and skill-level classifications among the racers, and maintain some kind of points-accumulation system over the racing season. The sport is very family oriented and largely participant-driven, with riders ranging in age from 2 to 70, and over.

By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread.

Answer the question...how many lives were lost in the bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki??","completion":"The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II represent one of the most significant and devastating events in human history. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped the first atomic bomb, named \\"Little Boy,\\" on Hiroshima, and three days later, on August 9, 1945, the second atomic bomb, named \\"Fat Man,\\" was dropped on Nagasaki. These two events led to the surrender of Japan and marked the end of World War II. Estimating the exact number of lives lost in both bombings is difficult due to various factors including the intensity of the blasts, the subsequent fires, and the long-term effects of radiation exposure. However, some approximations can be made based on historical records and research studies. In Hiroshima, it is estimated that approximately 140,000 people lost their lives as a direct or indirect result of the bombing. This number accounts for the immediate deaths due to the explosion, those who were killed by the fires that followed, and the people who perished as a result of the radiation exposure during the days, months, and years that followed. As Hiroshima had a population of around 350,000 at the time of the bombing, nearly 40% of the residents lost their lives. The bombing in Nagasaki claimed fewer lives, but the destruction was still immense. It is estimated that approximately 74,000 people died due to the bombing, either immediately or as a result of radiation exposure and its related health complications over the following years. A substantial portion of Nagasaki's 240,000 residents was affected by the blast. Adding the estimated fatalities from both cities, the total number of lives lost in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is approximately 214,000. It is essential to mention that apart from those who lost their lives, thousands of others faced long-term physical and psychological harm from the bombings. Survivors, also known as Hibakusha, experienced numerous health problems, including cancer and other radiation-induced illnesses. The social stigma associated with being a Hibakusha led to discrimination and further psychological distress for many. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the terrifying power and destruction of nuclear weapons, leading to global efforts towards nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. These tragic events still serve as a poignant reminder of the suffering and loss of life war can cause and the importance of promoting peace and diplomacy around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Master is a recurring character in the British science fiction television series Doctor Who and its associated spin-off works. The character is a renegade alien Time Lord and the archenemy of the title character the Doctor. The Master has been played by multiple actors since the character's introduction in 1971. The Master, played by Roger Delgado, makes his first appearance in Terror of the Autons (1971), where he allies with the Nestene Consciousness to help them invade Earth. The Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) convinces the Master to stop this plan at the last minute, and the Master subsequently escapes, albeit with his TARDIS, a space-time ship, left non-functioning after the Doctor confiscates the ship's dematerialisation circuit. Having become a main character in the show's eighth season, the Master reappears in The Mind of Evil, where he regains his TARDIS' circuit from the Doctor after attempting to launch a nerve gas missile that would initiate World War III. After another incursion on Earth in The Claws of Axos, and failing to hold the galaxy to ransom using a doomsday weapon on the planet Uxarieus in the year 2472 in Colony in Space, in The Daemons the Master is finally captured on Earth by the organisation UNIT after Jo Grant (Katy Manning) prevents the alien Azal (Stephen Thorne) from gifting the Master his powers. In The Sea Devils (1972), the Master is shown to be imprisoned on an island prison off the coast of England. He convinces the governor of the prison, Colonel Trenchard (Clive Morton), to help him steal electronics from HMS Seaspite, the nearby naval base, which helps the Master contact the reptilian Sea Devils, the former rulers of Earth, so he can help them retake the planet from humanity. The Master convinces the Doctor to help him build machinery that would bring the Sea Devils out of their millions of years of hibernation, but the Doctor sabotages the device by overloading it, destroying the Sea Devil base and preventing war between humanity and reptiles. The Master subsequently escapes in a hovercraft. The Doctor reveals in this serial that the Master was once a \\"very good friend\\" of his. Delgado's last appearance as the Master is in Frontier in Space (1973), where he works alongside the Dalek and Ogron races to provoke a war between the Human and Draconian Empires. The scheme fails, and the Master escapes after he shoots at the Doctor. Delgado was slated to return in a serial called The Final Game, which would have been the season 11 finale. However, he died in a car crash in June 1973 and the story was never filmed. The Master appeared as a main character of the 1996 Doctor Who television movie, played by American actor Eric Roberts. In the prologue, the Master (portrayed briefly by Gordon Tipple) is executed by the Daleks as a punishment for his \\"evil crimes\\". But before his apparent death, the Master requests his remains to be brought back to Gallifrey by the Seventh Doctor. However, as posited in the novelisation of the television movie by Gary Russell, the Master's self-alterations to extend his lifespan allow him to survive his execution by transferring his mind into a snake-like entity called a \\"morphant\\". This interpretation is made explicit in the first of the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, The Eight Doctors by Terrance Dicks, and also used in the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip story The Fallen, which states that the morphant was a shape-shifting animal native to Skaro. Using his morphant body to break free from the container holding his remains, the Master sabotages the TARDIS console to force the vessel to crash land in San Francisco at the start of Earth's new millennium. From there, the Master has the morphant enter the body of a paramedic named Bruce to take control of him. However, the Master finds his human host to be unsustainable as the body slowly begins to degenerate, although the Master has the added abilities to spit an acid-like bile, both as a weapon and to mentally control victims as an alternative to his usual hypnotic abilities. The Master attempts to access the Eye of Harmony to steal the remaining regenerations of the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann), but instead is sucked into it and supposedly killed. The Master and the Doctor are shown to have similar levels of intelligence, and were classmates at the Time Lord Academy on Gallifrey, where the Master outperformed the Doctor. A similar connection between the two was also referenced in The End of Time in which the Master reminisces with the Tenth Doctor about his father's estates on Gallifrey and his childhood with the Doctor before saying \\"look at us now\\". In the 2007 episode \\"Utopia\\", the Tenth Doctor calls the transformed and disguised Master a genius and shows admiration for his intellect before discovering his true identity. The Tenth Doctor further expresses admiration for the Master's intellect in The End of Time by calling him \\"stone cold brilliant\\" and yet states that the Master could be more if he would just give up his desire for domination. The Twelfth Doctor states that Missy is \\"the one person almost as smart as me\\" (\\"The Lie of the Land\\"). Delgado's portrayal of the Master was that of a suave and charming sociopathic individual, able to be polite and murderous at almost the same time. His design is homage to the classic Svengali character: a black Nehru outfit with a beard and moustache. Aspects of Simm's portrayal of the Master parallel Tennant's Doctor, primarily in his ability to make light of tense situations and his rather quirky and hyperactive personality. According to the producers, this was done to make the Master more threatening to the Doctor by having him take one of his opponent's greatest strengths, as well as making the parallels between the two characters more distinctive. This rationale is written into dialogue by the Master in \\"Utopia\\", in which he explicitly states, as he is regenerating, that if the Doctor can be young and strong, then so can he. In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential, \\"Lords and Masters\\", Russell T Davies also classifies the Master as both a sociopath and a psychopath. Michelle Gomez maintained Simm's portrayal of the character, specifically the psychopathic behavior and inappropriate emotional responses to certain situations, as well as the original traditions of ruthless, murderous behaviour and grandiose, Machiavellian criminal intelligence that have been consistent throughout all incarnations. However, she also displayed a much more coquettish manner, with her new female identity allowing her to fully express aspects of the Master's ambiguous bond with the Doctor (as previously explored by Simm's incarnation in \\"The Sound of Drums\\"). While determined to torment and corrupt the Doctor with moral temptation while inflicting pain and death to humanity, she frequently referred to him as her \\"boyfriend\\" or \\"friend\\" and appeared to ultimately desire his acquiescence and company. She is also well aware that she is even more dangerously psychopathic than before, describing herself as \\"Bananas\\" to UNIT agent Osgood right before killing her (\\"Death in Heaven\\"). However, when circumstances result in Missy being kept in a vault and monitored by the Doctor after an averted execution, Missy actually comes to show signs of remorse for what she had done in the past, to the point that she prepares to side with the Doctor over her own past self (\\"The Doctor Falls\\").

The passengers cram into a small village hotel for the night. Among the hotel guests eager to return to England are two British gentlemen, Caldicott and Charters, who are worried about missing the upcoming cricket Test match. The only room left for them is the maid's room. Other Britons are Iris (Margaret Lockwood), a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, now returning home to be married, Miss Froy (May Whitty), an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess and music teacher, Gilbert (Michael Redgrave), a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, and a secretive couple Mr. and Mrs. Todhunter (Cecil Parker and Linden Travers) who are having a clandestine affair. Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave. Miss Froy seems to particularly enjoy the musician in the street below, and she throws a coin out her window. The music stops, as a murderous hand is seen to strangle the balladeer, but no one seems to notice anything wrong.The next morning, as the passengers are leaving the hotel to board the train, Miss Froy asks Iris for help in finding her luggage. They huddle around a pile of baggage, and just then a flowerpot is pushed off a window ledge from an upper floor. The pot appears meant for Miss Froy, but it knocks Iris on the head, instead.

Question: \\"Where is Buddhism not seen as traditional?\\" Context: \\"Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.\\" Answer:","completion":"In the given context, Buddhism is not seen as traditional in Western countries. While Buddhism has spread throughout the world and its teachings have been translated into various languages, it is still often perceived as exotic and progressive in the West. This is in contrast to the familiar and traditional perception of Buddhism in Eastern countries, where it is more deeply rooted in the culture and history. In Western countries, Buddhism is generally considered a non-traditional or alternative spiritual path, and its followers may come from various religious or non-religious backgrounds. Many Westerners are attracted to Buddhism due to its emphasis on mindfulness, meditation, and self-improvement, which may be seen as appealing alternatives to the traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs and practices that dominate the religious landscape. As a result of this non-traditional perception and the cultural differences between East and West, the practice of Buddhism in Western countries often takes on new forms that depart significantly from the traditional beliefs and practices found in Asia. This may include adaptations in the practices and interpretations of core Buddhist ideas to suit the needs and sensibilities of Western practitioners. In summary, Buddhism is not seen as traditional in Western countries where it is often viewed as an alternative or non-conventional spiritual path. The practice of Buddhism in the West tends to evolve and adapt to suit the cultural context, resulting in new forms that differ from traditional Asian practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Gabe studied about other influencing factors. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student read more about reactant particles being heated? Hint: Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases.

Test sentence: \\"Carmen obtained a spare part to Mary.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","completion":"The test sentence, \\"Carmen obtained a spare part to Mary,\\" is not entirely correct grammatically. The main issue lies in the use of the preposition \\"to\\" in this context. The preposition \\"to\\" suggests a direction or a sense of movement towards something or someone. However, in this sentence, it is clear that Carmen obtained a spare part for Mary, not the physical act of moving towards her. A more grammatically correct version of the sentence would be: 1. Carmen obtained a spare part for Mary. In this version, the preposition \\"for\\" implies that Carmen got the spare part on Mary's behalf or for her benefit. This is a more precise and correct use of a preposition in this context. Alternatively, suppose Carmen gave the spare part to Mary after obtaining it. In that case, a better structured sentence would involve breaking the sentence into two parts or using a conjunction to link the two actions. Here are some other possible versions: 2. Carmen obtained a spare part and gave it to Mary. In this version, the sentence appropriately highlights Carmen's action of obtaining the spare part and then giving it to Mary. The conjunction \\"and\\" connects the two related actions. 3. Carmen obtained a spare part, then gave it to Mary. This version emphasizes the order of the actions: Carmen first obtained the spare part, and afterwards, she gave it to Mary. The adverb \\"then\\" helps to signal the sequence of events. In summary, while the initial test sentence has some merit, it has issues with the preposition \\"to,\\" which does not accurately convey the intended meaning. The suggested alternative sentences provide more grammatically correct and clear ways to express the same idea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Luckily I was not the target or victim of this road rage, but I was a first hand witness. Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information.

News article: .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the NSF, NSO and AURA decided to evacuate the observatory without advisement or assistance from the FBI. Mystery solved. Authorities say it wasn’t aliens, but a janitor’s unsavory tastes that ultimately led to the closure of an observatory in southern New Mexico. ADVERTISEMENTSkip The Sunspot Observatory was evacuated when that same janitor made veiled threats against the facility after federal agents seized a laptop he used to access child pornography. The closure on Sept. 6 sparked international attention since authorities refused to release any details, while news outlets and conspiracy theorists filled in the blanks with rumors of geomagnetic storms, alien sightings and apocalyptic asteroids. According to a search warrant filed in U.S. District Court in Las Cruces, the FBI began investigating after a wireless signal at the observatory, located on Sacramento Peak in the Lincoln National Forest, accessed child porn multiple times since January. During an interview on Aug. 21, the facility’s chief observer told agents he had found a running laptop with child porn on it in an empty office several months before. Agents say the chief observer believed the laptop belonged to a research student and didn’t report it at the time because he was “distracted by an urgent matter within the facility.” The chief observer told agents that only one person had access to the facility around the time of the child porn being accessed: a janitor who started working at the facility a year ago and cleans for a couple of hours a day. The janitor’s parents own the janitorial contract for the observatory. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Agents say the janitor has a key and “unlimited access” to the building. According to the search warrant, agents seized the laptop. Agents say that when the janitor returned the next morning, unaware of the seizure, he claimed to be “missing some cleaning supplies” and asked if anyone had been in the office. The chief observer told agents the janitor began complaining about “lax security” at the facility and claimed someone was breaking into the facility at night to steal internet service and toilet paper. As time went on, agents say the janitor’s actions grew increasingly “frantic” and he continually approached the chief observer with questions and comments about missing items. “(The janitor) had continued to look feverishly through the facility and continued to make comments about the lax security,” an agent wrote in the search warrant. ADVERTISEMENTSkip Agents say the janitor mentioned that decoy security cameras “were a joke” and it was only “a matter of time” until the facility “got hit.” The agencies that oversee the observatory, National Science Foundation, National Solar Observatory and Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, decided to evacuate and close the facility after the janitor spoke of a serial killer in the area and was fearful that the killer might “enter the facility and execute someone.” While authorities maintain their silence, the observatory reopened Monday. “Sunspot is now open, and we’re ready to show you all the great science and public outreach we do at this fantastic facility!” says a statement on the facility’s website. ||||| A federal search warrant reveals that Sunspot Solar Observatory was shut down as FBI agents conducted computer forensic searches for child pornography. The source of child pornography was traced to an IP address used at the observatory and a source within the building observed a computer with \\"not good\\" images on it, the warrant states. An investigation by the FBI revealed that a janitor is the main suspect in the search, however he has not been charged with a crime even though his name is on the warrant. The warrant states the suspect would use the observatory Wifi and a personal laptop to download the child pornography. A limited number of people have access to the observatory from dusk until dawn, which helped narrow their search. The observatory in the mountains of southern New Mexico had been closed since Sept. 6 because of an undisclosed security concern, but reopened on Monday. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The Sunspot Observatory in southern New Mexico was evacuated and closed due to a janitor's involvement in accessing child pornography, rather than the initially speculated extraterrestrial activities or geomagnetic storms.

Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her newfound harsh attitude upsets her mother, Cynthia, who once enjoyed a close relationship with her daughter. Cynthia is frustrated because the lines of communication have broken down between mother and daughter. Cynthia's relationship with her own mother is not entirely pleasant. Although Cynthia's alcoholic mother advises her daughter to be stricter with Deena, Cynthia does not heed the advice. For example, she tidies Deena's bedroom, a chore which Cynthia has consistently and politely reminded her daughter to do. When Deena discovers what Cynthia has done, she is less than grateful and reacts violently and ends up pushing her mother. Adam, Deena's younger brother notices the impact that Deena's behavior has upon his mother and drinks alcohol in order to forget about the family problems. At one point, Cynthia and Deena's relationship seems to improve, until Cynthia finds out that she has been skipping school. Her confrontation leads to an argument, during which Deena slaps her. Although she admits to Garret that she liked hitting her, Deena later apologizes to her mother, only to ask her to cover for her absence at school., can you guess it ?

A:","completion":"The question asks: \\"What is Bill?\\" Assessing each of the options will help us to find the right answer. Option A suggests that \\"He's Mr. Black's friend.\\" From the article, we find that this statement is true. The article does say, \\"This is Mr Black... We are good friends.\\" However, while this statement is correct, it does not fully identify who or what Bill is, but only a relationship he has with someone else. Option B states \\"He's Linda's husband.\\" Again, this is a true statement according to the article which says, \\"My wife is Linda.\\" Thus, Bill is identified as Linda's husband. Like option A though, while this is correct, it only indicates a relationship that Bill has, but doesn't specifically answer what Bill is. Option C indicates \\"He's an English teacher.\\" The article begins with the statement, \\"I am Bill. I am an English teacher.\\" This not only establishes who Bill is (an English teacher) but goes beyond his relationships to characterize what he does or who he is professionally. Option D posits \\"He's a worker.\\" This is incorrect because even though Bill is technically a worker since he is an English teacher, the term \\"worker\\" in the article is used in relation to Mr Black who \\"works in a shoe factory.\\" Bill isn't mentioned in any professional context as a worker. Therefore, based on the article and the question asked, the right answer appears to be Option C: \\"He's an English teacher\\", because it directly answers the question \\"what is Bill\\", describing his professional identity not just his personal relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, is demanding the return of Ikaika, pictured swimming in a tank at Marineland in Niagara Falls Lawyers for","completion":"SeaWorld argued that the loan agreement between the two parks clearly stated that Ikaika was to be returned upon request. They claimed that the Canadian marine park had breached the terms of the agreement by refusing to return the valuable orca. The Canadian marine park countered by stating that Ikaika's well-being was at risk if he were to be moved to the US facility, citing concerns about the treatment of animals at SeaWorld parks. This legal dispute caught the attention of animal rights activists, who argued that both facilities should prioritize the safety and welfare of the orca over any financial or business-related interests. The court eventually ruled in favor of SeaWorld, granting the US theme park custody of Ikaika. Preparations were then made to safely transport the orca from Canada to California. Specialized equipment, including a custom-built container filled with water and a team of marine mammal experts, were arranged to ensure Ikaika's physical and mental well-being during the transport. Additionally, the team carefully planned the logistics of the journey to minimize stress and risks to the whale's health. Upon arrival in San Diego, Ikaika was closely monitored by SeaWorld staff to help him adjust to his new environment. The park implemented a thorough care plan to address the orca's physical, social, and mental needs, reaffirming its commitment to prioritize the well-being of the animals in its care. However, the custody battle raised important questions about the ethics of keeping these intelligent, social creatures in captivity and led to ongoing debates about the role of marine entertainment parks and the future of orcas in captivity. In conclusion, the custody battle for Ikaika, a killer whale at the center of an international dispute, was resolved with his transfer to SeaWorld in San Diego. The US and Canadian theme parks initially fought over ownership, highlighting the complex issues surrounding orca captivity and raising concerns from animal rights activists. While the court ruling in favor of SeaWorld resolved the immediate legal issue, the discussion about the appropriate treatment and future of these magnificent animals in marine parks continues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which British surgeon is generally recognised as the founder of antiseptic surgery","completion":"The British surgeon generally recognized as the founder of antiseptic surgery is Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister (5 April 1827 – 10 February 1912). Born in Upton, Essex, England, Lister made significant contributions to the field of medicine, particularly in the area of infection control during surgical procedures. His discoveries and practices related to antiseptic surgical methods revolutionized the medical field and drastically reduced the rate of infection and mortality among patients. Joseph Lister pursued his medical studies at the University College London, earning his Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1847 and later becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1852. Throughout his career, he held various positions in major hospitals, including lecturing and teaching medical students. He served as a Professor of Surgery at the University of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh as well as the President of the British Royal Society from 1895 to 1900. Lister's groundbreaking work in antiseptic surgery was sparked by the work of French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that microorganisms such as bacteria were responsible for the spoilage of food and beverages. Pasteur's research prompted Lister to question whether bacteria could also be responsible for the high rates of infection and death among surgical patients. Intrigued by this possibility, Lister began conducting experiments to reduce the presence of bacteria in the operating room. He discovered that carbolic acid (now known as phenol), which was used as a disinfectant for treating sewage, could be used to clean surgical instruments and dressings as well as to cleanse wounds. He developed a new approach to surgery, using sterilized instruments, antiseptic dressings, and a careful cleaning of patients’ wounds to prevent contamination. Lister's new antiseptic methods were a turning point in surgical history. Before Lister's discoveries, post-operative infections, often referred to as \\"hospital gangrene\\" or sepsis, were common and frequently led to the death of patients. The introduction of antiseptic surgery dramatically reduced infection rates and significantly improved patient outcomes. Joseph Lister's contributions to the field of medicine were widely recognized during his lifetime and after his death. The medical world has since continued to build upon his pioneering work, and his techniques have evolved into the modern protocols of aseptic surgery that surgeons still follow today. Lister's work has saved countless lives, and he is rightfully remembered as a giant in the history of medicine, dubbed the \\"father of modern surgery\\" for his innovations in antiseptic practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Agent Bart Langner finds Elsa Brinkmann, a would-be actress who looks and sounds just like Lylah Clare, a flamboyant star who fell to her death in suspicious circumstances 20 years ago. He persuades arrogant director Lewis Zarkan, who had been married to Lylah, to see her. The two men then convince brash studio head Barney Sheean, who is equally struck, to back a picture with her as Lylah. Besides coping with the tyrannical Zarkan and easy access to alcohol and drugs, Elsa also has to contend with other hazards of Hollywood like malicious journalist Molly Luther and lesbian admirer Rossella. As filming continues, her identification with her rôle gets more intense. She also begins to fall in love with Zarkan, who is happy to sleep with her but his priority is to get his film finished. By the last day of shooting, her personality seems to have merged with that of the outrageous Lylah whose fatal fall, we learn, was prompted by the jealous Zarkan. To antagonise him, she first lets him find her in bed with the gardener. Then, as he directs her in a circus scene, she leaps to her death from the high-wire. The resulting publicity makes his film a huge success. Tragedy later comes when Zarkan himself is shot and killed by Rossella.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier.

Clarence Edwin \\"Cito\\" Gaston (; born March 17, 1944) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder and manager. His major league career as a player lasted from 1967 to 1978, most notably for the San Diego Padres and the Atlanta Braves. He spent his entire managerial career with the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the first African-American manager in Major League history to win a World Series title. Cito Gaston managed the Toronto Blue Jays from 1989 to 1997, and again from 2008 to 2010. As a coach and manager, Gaston was considered a player's manager. He was a soft-spoken and steady influence during years that saw a large group of talented, high-salaried players grace the Blue Jays uniform. The franchise led the Major Leagues in attendance each year from 1989 to 1992, setting new records each of the latter three years, riding high from a dedicated fan base and a new stadium to play in when Gaston took the helm. The Jays opened the SkyDome a few weeks after Gaston became manager and the financial success translated into major free agent signings, including pitcher Jack Morris, outfielder Dave Winfield, and designated hitter Paul Molitor. They also retained core All-Stars such as Joe Carter, Devon White, Roberto Alomar, and John Olerud. Joe Carter credits Gaston for the team's championships: Cito knows how to work with each individual, treating everyone like a human being. He knows exactly what to say, when to say it, what to do and how to go about doing it. When you have a manager like that, it makes you want to play for the guy. We'd go to war for him. What Cito has done for the Blue Jays can't be taken lightly. Gaston had worked with players at an individual level as a hitting instructor and transferred this to the job of manager. He was known for his open communication with his players. He was a successful game strategist, effectively handling National League rules during World Series games in Atlanta and Philadelphia.

Review title: Simplest yogurt maker ever! Product review: I've had my Salton yogurt maker for 3 years and it's wonderful. I started out scientifically measuring the temperatures and measuring the starter. Now, I microwave milk in a pyrex bowl(in)for about 5 minutes let it cool a few minutes then pour it along with about 1/2 cup of starter (from the last batch or a new container)into a clean empty Dannon 32 oz. yogurt container (which fits the unit perfectly, is easier to clean, and I can keep several in circulation so I always have yogurt in the fridge!). I plug in the unit and forget about it. I notice the orange power light every time I'm in the kitchen and retrieve the yogurt in 24-48 hours (I like it fairly thick). Fantastic! I buy an 8 oz. plain yogurt (if I can find one, blasted supermarkets usually only stock plain in 32 oz. size) for starter about once a month. A:","completion":"After analyzing the review, the chances of buying the product would likely increase. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the justifications: 1. The reviewer has had the Salton yogurt maker for 3 years, which indicates durability and long-term satisfaction with the product. 2. The reviewer describes the process of making yogurt as simple and easy, which is a positive aspect for potential buyers who value convenience and ease of use. 3. The reviewer mentions using an alternative yogurt container, demonstrating the flexibility and adaptability of the product to suit personal preferences. 4. The yogurt maker requires minimal monitoring, allowing users to \\"plug in the unit and forget about it,\\" which is another positive feature in terms of convenience and low maintenance. 5. The reviewer states that the yogurt turns out \\"fantastic\\" and they like it fairly thick, implying that the product delivers satisfactory results for its intended purpose. 6. The only issue mentioned is about finding an 8 oz. plain yogurt as a starter; however, this concern is not directly related to the performance of the yogurt maker itself but rather the availability of starter yogurt in stores.

Lush was a British alternative rock band that formed in 1987 and was active until 1998. The band's original lineup consisted of Miki Berenyi (vocals, guitar), Emma Anderson (guitar, vocals), Steve Rippon (bass), and Chris Acland (drums). In 1991, Rippon was replaced with Phil King on bass. Miki Berenyi, born on March 18, 1967, is of Japanese and Hungarian descent. She is known for her distinctive vocals and striking red hair. Berenyi met future bandmate Emma Anderson during their time in school. The two eventually formed Lush, with each of them contributing vocals and playing guitar. Lush was part of the shoegazing and Britpop movements during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Some of their popular releases include albums such as \\"Spooky\\" (1992), \\"Split\\" (1994), and \\"Lovelife\\" (1996). On the other hand, Nell Sigland is a Norwegian singer who was a member of the gothic metal band Theatre of Tragedy. She joined the band in 2004 after the departure of their original vocalist, Liv Kristine. Sigland contributed to two albums \\"Storm\\" (2006) and \\"Forever Is the World\\" (2009) during her time with Theatre of Tragedy. It is worth noting that Theatre of Tragedy's musical style is quite different from Lush's alternative rock sound.

[-] no.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The Russians planned to hold the line of the Ingur River which separates Abkhazia from Georgia proper.\\" answers the question \\"What river divides Abkhazia from Georgia?\\" The sentence explicitly states that the Ingur River serves as the dividing line between Abkhazia and Georgia proper (the core territories of Georgia). The ingur river functions as a natural border between the two regions, and its mention in this context confirms that it is indeed the geographical feature that separates them. Abkhazia is a disputed territory in the South Caucasus, located on the eastern coast of the Black Sea. While it considers itself an independent state, it is widely regarded as a part of Georgia by the international community. The Ingur River has historical, political, and geographical significance in the region. The Ingur River, also referred to as the Enguri River, is approximately 213 kilometers (132 miles) long. It originates from the Greater Caucasus Mountains in Georgia and flows through the Svaneti region before reaching Abkhazia. The river then flows into the Black Sea, forming a delta near the Abkhaz town of Ochamchira. The Ingur River's hydroelectric potential has long been harnessed through the construction of the Inguri Hydroelectric Power Station. The dam and reservoir are located in the Georgian region of Samegrelo, while the power station sits on the Abkhaz side. This strategic infrastructure reflects the importance of the river within the region for both economic and energy sustainability. The political and military tensions between Georgia and Abkhazia make the Ingur River a significant border in the disputed territory. Russian involvement in the region dating back to the 1990s has played a role in the conflict between Abkhazia and Georgia, as illustrated by the sentence that mentions Russian plans to hold the line along the Ingur River. In conclusion, the sentence does answer the question \\"What river divides Abkhazia from Georgia?\\" by identifying the Ingur River as the geographical feature that separates the two regions. The river holds a crucial significance in the history, politics, and geography of the wider South Caucasus region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the Human Rights Act 1998.

It is surely the bane of drivers' lives - discovering what you think is the perfect parking spot, only for it to be ruined by the appearance of a set of double yellow lines. But at just four foot wide, and far too narrow to fit a car down, it was unlikely any motorists were going to risk a ticket down this lane. This 'ridiculous' set of double yellow lines, painted by bungling council workers on a Wiltshire lane, have now been covered over after complaints from residents. Swindon Borough Council became was branded a laughing stock when the lines appeared earlier this year. A 'ridiculous' set of double yellow lines were painted by council workers on a Swindon lane which is too narrow to drive down. The council blamed the gaffe on contractors, incredibly saying the workers had forgotten 'just how big cars actually are'. There was just 13 inches of space between the two sets of yellow lines - which is roughly the width of some high-end car tyres, and barely wide enough to fit a toy car between. The council blamed the gaffe on contractors, incredibly saying the workers had forgotten 'just how big cars actually are'. A spokesman for the council has now confirmed the yellow lines have now been covered over in black paint.

The yellow lines were in a lane so narrow a man struggles to walk in the space in between them (left) and (right) resident Liz Adams in the lane, now the council has 'erased them' using black paint. Ray Mudhar, the owner of Ray's Autos near the alleyway double yellow lines in Swindon, previously described the gaffe as 'one of the stupidest things I've ever seen.' He said: 'When me and my mate saw it we were just laughing our heads off. It's a waste of time, waste of money and waste of material. 'The only thing you could get down there would be a bike and no-one is going to leave a bike parked up there. 'They have painted down all the alleys around here.

If \\"A young man is crossing an urban street at the crosswalk.\\", does this mean that \\"An old man is waiting to cross the street\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"A young man is crossing an urban street at the crosswalk\\" does not provide enough information to establish whether or not \\"An old man is waiting to cross the street.\\" The two scenarios could coexist, or they could be completely independent of one another. There are several possibilities to consider in relation to the two statements: 1. Coincidentally, the old man is waiting to cross the street at the same crosswalk: In this scenario, both the statements are accurate, and the two individuals are present at the same location. However, the initial statement does not explicitly suggest this, so we can't make this assumption without additional context or information. 2. The old man is waiting to cross the street at a different crosswalk: In this case, both the young man and the old man are present in the urban area but at different locations. The initial statement does not provide any information about the old man or his location, so this scenario remains a possibility. 3. There is no old man waiting to cross the street: It's entirely possible that the initial statement is focused solely on describing the young man's actions, and there is no old man waiting to cross the street at all. The absence of any mention of the old man in the statement doesn't confirm that he exists in the scene. 4. The young man and the old man are unrelated: The two situations might be completely independent of one another, and the statement about the young man crossing the street doesn't necessarily have any bearing on the old man's actions. There might be a young man crossing the street at the crosswalk and an old man waiting to cross the street at a different time or place. 5. Additional context or information about the scene is needed: To confirm whether or not an old man is waiting to cross the street, more information about the situation would be necessary. Details such as whether there are multiple crosswalks in the area, the time of day, or the level of pedestrian traffic could offer more insight into the relationship between the young man and the old man's activities. In conclusion, without further context or information, we cannot definitively determine if \\"An old man is waiting to cross the street\\" based on the statement, \\"A young man is crossing an urban street at the crosswalk.\\" These scenarios are not mutually inclusive or exclusive and could occur independently or concurrently. More details or context would be needed to provide a direct correlation between the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Review: showtime is n't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as negative. The reviewer doesn't explicitly criticize the movie by using harsh language or intense negativity, but the overall tone and implications suggest dissatisfaction with the film. The term \\"assaultive\\" implies that the movie does not aggressively attack the viewer with intense action sequences. However, the following statement about not wanting to see another car chase, explosion, or gunfight again implies that the film may have used these elements excessively, leading to viewer fatigue or disinterest. Furthermore, the word \\"but\\" serves as a contrast between the movie not being particularly assaultive and the negative impact it still has on the viewer. If the review were positive, the writer would likely point out how the movie effectively utilized these action elements without causing viewer burnout. To summarize, this movie review sentence is negative because it implies that the movie's use of common action tropes such as car chases, explosions, and gunfights might be excessive to the point where the viewer is fatigued by them and no longer finds them enjoyable or engaging."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. She's institutionalized.

Given those answer options, answer the question: You are presented with the quiz \\"What does biodiversity do towards the poles?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"biodiversity generally increases from the poles to the equator\\" and \\"biodiversity, on the whole, increases towards the equator and decreases towards the poles\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"Biodiversity decreases towards the poles Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question, \\"What does biodiversity do towards the poles?\\" can be determined. The teacher mentioned that \\"biodiversity generally increases from the poles to the equator\\" and \\"biodiversity, on the whole, increases towards the equator and decreases towards the poles\\". Both these statements suggest that as we move from the equator towards the poles, the overall biodiversity reduces. There are several factors that contribute to this decrease in biodiversity towards the poles. These factors primarily revolve around climatic and environmental conditions: 1. Temperature: As we move towards the poles, the temperature drops significantly. The harsh, cold environment that polar regions are characterized by limits the number of species that can survive and thrive in these areas. Species that live in these extreme environments have specific adaptations to withstand these conditions, but overall, fewer species can tolerate living in such locations as compared to more temperate or tropical areas. 2. Availability of sunlight: In polar regions, sunlight availability is limited due to the Earth's tilt and the length of day varying between the summer and winter solstices. In some parts of the polar region, the sun does not rise or set for months at a time. This leads to a reduction in primary productivity (the production of organic compounds through photosynthesis), which then affects the entire food chain and leads to reduced biodiversity. 3. Habitats: The extreme conditions of the polar regions result in reduced habitat diversity. The land may often be covered in snow and ice, which limits the number of habitats that can support life. These habitats also tend to be relatively uniform in nature, further reducing biodiversity. 4. Nutrient availability: Due to the lower temperatures, the rate of decomposition of dead matter in the poles is slower than in more temperate regions. Consequently, the release of nutrients into the soil is slower as well, leading to nutrient-poor ecosystems that are unable to sustain a high biodiversity. With the above factors in mind, the best answer to the question, \\"What does biodiversity do towards the poles?\\" would be \\"Biodiversity decreases towards the poles\\". In line with the hints provided by the teacher, the overall biodiversity tends to decrease as we travel from the equator to the poles, mainly due to the extreme environmental conditions and reduced habitat diversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fortunately, you can remove them using items you may already have at home. One choice is lemon Kool-aid. Simply sprinkle 1 package of lemon Kool-aid around the toilet bowl, wait 1 hour, and use a toilet brush to scrub away stains. Lemon Kool-aid is available at most grocery stores for as little as 0.25. Pumice stones are excellent at scrubbing away hard water stains. Use a pumice stone you already have at home, or purchase a \\"pumie\\" (a pumice stone on a stick designed for this purpose). Soak your pumice stone in water for 10-15 minutes, then use it to scrub away stains. Dryer sheets are another great product for scouring away hard water stains. In fact, used dryer sheets seem to work even better than brand new ones! Wear a pair of rubber gloves, then use an ordinary dryer sheet (used or unused) to scrub away stains.","completion":"Hard water stains, which are both commonplace and visually displeasing, can fortunately be removed using everyday household items. There are a few different methods you can choose from to effectively eliminate these stains. One option is to use lemon Kool-aid, a commonly found and affordable product available at most grocery stores for as low as 0.25. Begin by sprinkling one packet of the lemon-flavored powder around the toilet bowl. Allow it to sit for approximately an hour before using a toilet brush to scrub the stains away, revealing a clean surface. Another effective way to remove hard water stains is by using pumice stones. These are a great natural and environmentally friendly choice and can be applied in two forms: an ordinary pumice stone or a \\"pumie,\\" a specialized pumice stone with a handle designed specifically for cleaning purposes. To utilize this method, submerge the pumice stone in water for 10-15 minutes to soften it and then scrub the stained area. The abrasive qualities of the stone will effectively remove the hard water stains. Lastly, dryer sheets, particularly used ones, can also be quite efficient at tackling hard water stains. You can simply grab an old or new dryer sheet, put on a pair of rubber gloves as a precaution, and scrub the stained area using the dryer sheet. The texture of the sheet will help to scour away the pesky hard water stains, bringing back the cleanliness and shine of the surface. In conclusion, hard water stains can be effectively removed using everyday items such as lemon Kool-aid, pumice stones, and dryer sheets. By employing these materials and incorporating proper cleaning techniques, you can easily restore the appearance of your toilet bowl or any other surface affected by hard water stains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because the reduced number of bacteria would take fewer resources from other cells, allowing them to function more properly. As a result, the body would feel less unwell. Additionally, the fewer dividing and growing bacteria would produce less toxins, causing less harm to the body. The body's natural defenses would still react to the toxins, but this response would be less pronounced due to the lower toxin levels.

Background: Thirty Seconds to Mars (commonly stylized as 30 Seconds to Mars) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. The band consists of Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards), Shannon Leto (drums, percussion) and Tomo Milicevic (lead guitar, bass, violin, keyboards, other instruments). The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of their second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world, including platinum in the United States. Context: Thirty Seconds to Mars launched a website, called abeautifullie.org, to provide information about environmental issues and ways to participate in environmental activities. People can make donations through the site to support the Natural Resources Defense Council. In 2006, Jared Leto created the cover art for The 97X Green Room: Volume 2, a compilation of live music that includes a Thirty Seconds to Mars song, which proceeds from the sales benefited The Nature Conservancy. During their Welcome to the Universe Tour, the group worked to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption to offset the impact that the tour would have had on the environment. In June 2008, the band joined Habitat for Humanity to work on a home being repaired and renovated through the Greater Los Angeles Area's \\"A Brush With Kindness\\" programme. In advance of the build, the band organized an auction of \\"build slots\\" to give fans the opportunity to volunteer alongside them. In less than a week, six extra workers were enlisted and over 10,000 was raised to fund additional Habitat for Humanity projects. Thirty Seconds to Mars fans, termed as the Echelon, started several philanthropic organizations and projects with the purpose of supporting various charities and humanitarian causes. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Thirty Seconds to Mars raised 100,100 for Haitian relief through a charity auction. The band has also supported the Haitian population through the Echelon project \\"House for Haiti\\" and Hope For Haiti Now telethon special. The group auctioned a quantity of items raising funds to help the Red Cross assist people affected by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. The band contributed one dollar per concert ticket sold on the Carnivores Tour to the charity Music for Relief to support disaster relief and programs to protect and restore the environment. Question: Did they donate any money?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Thirty Seconds to Mars, beyond their extensive involvement in environmental and humanitarian issues, have also been involved in numerous charitable donations. They have used a variety of ways to raise and donate money to causes and organizations they support. In their efforts towards environmental conservation, the band developed the website abeautifullie.org. Visitors could gain knowledge about environmental issues, participate in related activities, and make donations to the Natural Resources Defense Council — an organization dedicated to preserving natural resources and the environment. Their embrace of philanthropy extended to their creative endeavors as well. A notable example is the cover art that Jared Leto created for The 97X Green Room: Volume 2. This compilation of live music included a song by Thirty Seconds to Mars and proceeds from its sales were directed to The Nature Conservancy, thus providing financial support to this organization. Their commitment to charity was also demonstrated during their Welcome to the Universe Tour, during which the band sought to develop strategies to minimize fuel consumption, effectively offsetting the environmental impact of touring, and in turn saving money which could potentially be used to support their philanthropic ventures. In addition, the band contributed their time and effort to Habitat for Humanity in June 2008. They didn't stop at just contributing their physical efforts, they also found a way to financially contribute to the cause by auctioning off \\"build slots\\", which gave fans a chance to volunteer alongside them. This creative approach to charity allowed them to raise over 10,000 in less than a week, which was utilized for future Habitat for Humanity projects. The band's fans, known as the Echelon, were inspired to start their own philanthropic organizations and projects, aimed at supporting various charities and humanitarian causes. This shows that the band's charitable efforts not only involved donating their own money, but also motivating their fan base to establish organizations that perpetuate these acts of philanthropy. After the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, the band managed to raise 100,100 toward Haitian relief through a charity auction. They also supported the Haitian population through the Echelon project \\"House for Haiti\\" as well as the Hope For Haiti Now telethon special. When the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami struck, the band rallied once again, auctioning numerous items to raise funds that helped the Red Cross in their efforts to assist people affected by the disaster. Lastly, the band donated one dollar from each concert ticket sold on the Carnivores Tour to the charity Music for Relief, assisting in disaster relief efforts and backing programs that protect and restore the environment. Therefore, the evidence points to a strong trend of financial giving by Thirty Seconds to Mars, either directly or indirectly, in support of various charitable causes over the years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nonetheless, by 1895, Irwin's coaching role at Penn included the selection of players and other duties that traditionally fell to the team captain. Irwin left Philadelphia in 1896 to manage the New York Giants. Relieved of his duties after one season in New York, he was subsequently recruited to manage in Milwaukee. However, he returned to coach the minor league team in his native Toronto instead. Irwin coached Toronto during 1897 and 1898. He faced arrest on a libel charge in 1898, which stemmed from comments made by Irwin about the actions of the Philadelphia ownership during his time there. Though Irwin turned himself in, it appears that he was never arrested. In 1898, Irwin traded some of his best players to the Washington major league team. The moves were seen as particularly suspect when Irwin was named the Washington manager shortly thereafter. After 1899, Irwin did not return to the major leagues as a coach. He returned for a subsequent term as Penn's coach in 1900, but he left in 1902. In August 1902, Irwin was signed as an NL umpire for the remainder of that season. Irwin, who had previously only filled in for one three-day umpiring stretch in 1881, umpired his first NL game on August 7, 1902. His last umpiring appearance came with the end of the 1902 season on October 3. In fifty games as an umpire, Irwin ejected nine players, including future Hall of Fame inductees Roger Bresnahan and Fred Clarke. Irwin, who had retained partial ownership of the Toronto club, then returned to manage that team for a couple of seasons. By 1906, Irwin was manager of the Altoona Mountaineers in the Tri-State League. In July 1907, Irwin resigned as manager of the Mountaineers after fans became disgruntled. Even after entering baseball scouting, Irwin briefly managed the 1908 Washington club in the short-lived Union Professional League. The league was plagued by financial problems--including the inability to pay players at times--and it folded less than two months after play began. He was rehired to the Penn coaching staff in 1908.

Wall Street Journal managing editor Alan Murray and editors discuss Jobs's legacy, early reactions to his death and how his showmanship changed the retail and tech landscape. Steven P. Jobs, the Apple Inc. chairman and co-founder who pioneered the personal-computer industry and changed the way people think about technology, died Wednesday at the age of 56. His family, in a statement released by Apple, said Mr. Jobs \\"died peacefully today surrounded by his family.\\" The company didn't specify the cause of death. Mr. Jobs had battled pancreatic cancer and several years ago received a liver transplant. In August, Mr. Jobs stepped down as chief executive, handing the reins to longtime deputy Tim Cook. \\"Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being,\\" Mr. Cook said in a letter to employees. \\"We will honor his memory by dedicating ourselves to continuing the work he loved so much.\\" During his more than three-decade career, Mr. Jobs transformed Silicon Valley as he helped turn the once-sleepy expanse of fruit orchards into the technology industry's innovation center. In addition to laying the groundwork for the industry alongside others like Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, Mr. Jobs proved the appeal of well-designed products over the power of technology itself and transformed the way people interact with technology. \\"The world rarely sees someone who has had the profound impact Steve has had, the effects of which will be felt for many generations to come,\\" Mr. Gates said in a statement Wednesday. The most productive chapter in Mr. Jobs's career occurred near the end of his life, when a nearly unbroken string of successful products like the iPod, iPhone and iPad changed the PC, electronics and digital-media industries. The way he marketed and sold those products through savvy advertising campaigns and Apple's retail stores helped turn the company into a pop-culture phenomenon. At the beginning of that phase, Mr. Jobs described his philosophy as trying to make products that were at \\"the intersection of art and technology.\\" In doing so, he turned Apple into the world's most valuable company with a market value of 350 billion. Steve Jobs has been interviewed by Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher a number of times over the years at the All Things D Conference. Take a look back at some of the highlights - including Jobs and Bill Gates on stage together. After losing considerable weight in mid-2008, Mr. Jobs took a nearly six-month medical leave of absence in 2009, during which he received a liver transplant. He took another medical leave of absence in mid-January, without explanation, before stepping down as CEO. Mr. Jobs is survived by his wife, Laurene, and four children. Mr. Jobs turned Apple into the largest retailer of music and helped popularize computer-animated films as the financier and CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, which he later sold to Walt Disney Co. He was a key figure in changing the way people used the Internet and how they listened to music, watched TV shows and movies, and read books, disrupting industries in the process. \\"Despite all he accomplished, it feels like he was just getting started,\\" Disney CEO Robert Iger said in a statement Wednesday. Fans held iPads during a vigil outside an Apple store in Tokyo Thursday. Mr. Jobs pulled off a remarkable business comeback, returning to Apple after an 11-year absence during which he was largely written off as a has-been. He went on to revive the struggling company by introducing products such as the iMac all-in-one computer, iPod music player and iTunes digital-music store. Apple now produces 65.2 billion a year in revenue compared with 7.1 billion in its business year ended September 1997. Apple dropped the \\"computer\\" in its name in January 2007 to underscore its expansion beyond PCs. Although Mr. Jobs officially handed over the reins of the company to Mr. Cook, his death nevertheless raises a question for Apple of how it will sustain its success without his vision and guidance. Other companies, including Walt Disney, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and International Business Machines Corp., experienced some transitional woes before eventually managing to thrive after their charismatic founders passed on. But few companies of that stature have shown such an acute dependence on their founder, or have lost the founder at the peak of his career. Several years after Mr. Jobs was fired from Apple in 1985, the company began a steady decline that saw it drift to the margins of the computer industry. That slide was reversed only after Mr. Jobs returned in 1997. AllThingsD's Kara Swisher discusses the what the impact of Steve Jobs's death will have on Apple and whether the company will remain an innovator and market leader. Photo: Getty Images Mr. Jobs also leaves behind many tales about his mercurial management style, such as his habit of calling employees or their ideas \\"dumb\\" when he didn't like something. He was even more combative against foes like Microsoft, Google Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. When Adobe Systems Inc. waged a campaign against Apple for not supporting Adobe's Flash video format on its iPhones and iPads in April 2010, Mr. Jobs wrote a 1,600-word essay about why the software was outdated and inadequate for mobile devices. He maintained uncompromising standards for the company's hardware and software, demanding \\"insanely great\\" aesthetics and ease of use from the moment a shopper walked into one of Apple's stores. His attention to detail shaped some of the distinctive features of Apple's products. Apple CEO and co-founder Steve Jobs died on Wednesday at the age of 56. A look back at the life of an American business icon. (Photo: Getty Images) Mr. Jobs enforced strict secrecy among employees, a strategy that he believed heightened anticipation for new products. News of his death came a day after Apple unveiled its newest device, the iPhone 4S, without him on stage. Mr. Jobs, the adopted son of a family in California, was born on Feb. 24, 1955. A college dropout, he established his reputation early on as a tech innovator when, at 21 years old, he and friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computer Inc. in the Jobs family garage in 1976. Mr. Jobs chose the name, in part, because he was a Beatles fan and admired the group's Apple records label, according to the book \\"Apple: The Inside Story of Intrigue, Egomania, and Business Blunders\\" by Wall Street Journal reporter Jim Carlton. The pair came out with the Apple II in 1977, a computer that was relatively affordable and designed for the mass market rather than for hobbyists. It went on to become one of the first commercially successful PCs, making the company 117 million in annual sales by the time of Apple's initial public offering in 1980. The IPO instantly made Mr. Jobs a multimillionaire. Not all of Mr. Jobs's early ideas paid off. The Apple III and Lisa computers that debuted in 1980 and 1983 were flops. But the distinctive all-in-one Macintosh—foreshadowed in a TV ad inspired by George Orwell's novel \\"1984\\" that famously only aired once—would set the standard for the design of modern computer operating systems. Even then, Mr. Jobs was a stickler for design details. Bruce Tognazzini, a former user-interface expert at Apple who joined the company in 1978, once said that Mr. Jobs was adamant that the keyboard not include \\"up,\\" \\"down,\\" \\"right,\\" and \\"left\\" keys that allow users to move the cursor around their computer screens. Mr. Jobs's pursuit of aesthetics sometimes bordered on the extreme. George Crow, an Apple engineer in the 1980s and again from 1998 to 2005, recalls how Mr. Jobs wanted to make even the inside of computers attractive. On the original Macintosh PC, Mr. Crow says Mr. Jobs wanted the internal wiring to be in the colors of Apple's early rainbow logo. Mr. Crow says he persuaded Mr. Jobs it was an unnecessary expense. Even in his appearance, Mr. Jobs seemed to cultivate an image more like that of an artist than a corporate executive. In public, he rarely deviated from an outfit consisting of Levi's jeans, a black mock turtleneck and New Balance running shoes. As Apple expanded, Mr. Jobs decided to bring in a more experienced manager to lead the company. He recruited John Sculley from PepsiCo Inc. to be Apple CEO in 1983, overcoming Mr. Sculley's initial reluctance by asking the executive if he just wanted to sell \\"sugar water to kids\\" or help change the world. After Apple fell into a subsequent slump, a leadership struggle led to a board decision to back Mr. Sculley and fire Mr. Jobs two years later at the age of 30. \\"What can I say—I hired the wrong guy,\\" Mr. Jobs brooded in a PBS documentary. \\"He destroyed everything I had spent 10 years working for.\\" Mr. Jobs then created NeXT Inc., a start-up that in 1988 introduced a black desktop computer with advanced software. The machine suffered from a high price and some key design decisions. But its operating system would eventually become a foundation for OS X, the software backbone of today's Macs, after Apple purchased NeXT for 400 million in December 1996. In 1986, using part of his fortune from Apple, Mr. Jobs paid filmmaker George Lucas 10 million to acquire the computer-graphics division of Lucasfilm Ltd. The company Mr. Jobs formed from that purchase, Pixar Animation Studios, went on to create a string of computer-animated film hits, such as \\"Toy Story.\\" Mr. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006 in a 7.4 billion deal. In Mr. Jobs's absence, Apple began foundering, and computers using Intel chips and Microsoft software became increasingly dominant. By 1997, Apple had racked up nearly 2 billion in losses in two years, its shares were at record lows and it was on its third CEO—Gil Amelio—in four years. Eight months after the deal to buy NeXT in December 1996, Mr. Amelio was ousted and Mr. Jobs appointed interim CEO, a title that became permanent in January 2000. One former Apple employee recalls Mr. Jobs joking soon after he returned that \\"the lunatics have taken over the asylum and we can do anything we want.\\" Mr. Jobs, who was given a salary of 1 a year along with options to Apple stock, made a series of changes. He killed the struggling Newton handheld computer and trimmed a confusing array of Mac models to a handful of systems focused on the consumer market. In May 1998, he introduced the iMac, an unusual one-piece computer that sported a colorful translucent case. Apple launched an ad campaign featuring the phrase \\"Think Different,\\" featuring photographs of creative individuals including Albert Einstein and Muppets creator Jim Henson. While shareholders cheered the changes, Mr. Jobs flexed his power on Apple's Cupertino, Calif., campus. Within months of taking over, he replaced four of the five top executives with former NeXT underlings. He issued emails forbidding employees to bring pets to the office or to smoke, even in parking lots. He threatened to fire anyone caught leaking company documents. Apple had stumbles during Mr. Jobs's second stint, including a cube-shaped Macintosh that failed to catch on and was scrapped in 2001. The failure was one reason Apple posted a quarterly loss and warned it would miss estimates several times in 2000 and 2001. But big hits followed. In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, which transformed digital music players. Apple has more than 70% market share in the market. A key advantage was the iTunes Music Store, opened in 2003. Mr. Jobs helped persuade major record labels to sell recordings for 99 cents each. The store, which has sold more than 16 billion songs, became an incentive for people to buy iPods because, for much of its history, songs from the iTunes store could be downloaded only to Apple's music player. At the same time, Mr. Jobs was building his bench of executives. He recruited Mr. Cook, a former Compaq Computer Corp. executive, in the late 1990s to straighten Apple's operations and promoted him over time to chief operating officer. In 2004, Mr. Jobs had to lean on this bench when he disclosed that he had had surgery to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas. Apple revealed the procedure in early August 2004, but a person familiar with the situation said Mr. Jobs first learned of the tumor during a routine abdominal scan nine months earlier. The board and Mr. Jobs said nothing to Apple shareholders as the Apple executive, during that time, dealt with the tumor through changes to his diet, the person said. In June 2007, Mr. Jobs made another splash when Apple introduced the iPhone. Mr. Jobs was typically hands-on in the creation of the iPhone. People familiar with the matter say the former CEO was the one who made a decision to change the screen of the iPhone from plastic to glass after he unveiled the product at the Macworld trade show in 2007. The iPhone team scrambled to procure glass that would meet his standards, so the devices could be manufactured in time for the launch. Despite skepticism about Apple's ability to enter an already competitive market dominated by the likes of Research in Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry devices, Apple became a force in the mobile phone market, selling 92 million iPhones as of December 2010. Last year, Mr. Jobs also unveiled the iPad tablet computer to great fanfare. Apple has sold more than 29 million iPads as buyers snapped them up. People who work closely with Mr. Jobs said the project was so important to him that he was deeply involved in its planning even while recovering from his 2009 liver transplant. Those who knew Mr. Jobs say one reason why he was able to keep innovating was because he didn't dwell on past accomplishments and demanded that employees do the same. Hitoshi Hokamura, a former Apple employee, recalls how an old Apple I that was displayed by the company cafeteria quietly disappeared after Mr. Jobs returned in the late 1990s. \\"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose,\\" Mr. Jobs said in a commencement speech at Stanford University in June 2005, almost a year after he was diagnosed with cancer.

As of 2010, the most widespread are ID3v1 and ID3v2, and the more recently introduced APEv2. These tags are normally embedded at the beginning or end of MP3 files, separate from the actual MP3 frame data. MP3 decoders either extract information from the tags, or just treat them as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data. If the MP3 decoders do not extract information from the tags, what do they do to them?","completion":"If MP3 decoders do not extract information from the tags, they essentially treat these tags as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data. In this context, it is important to understand the structure and function of MP3 tags and how they interact with MP3 decoders. MP3 tags, such as ID3v1, ID3v2, and APEv2, are metadata containers that provide information about an MP3 file, such as the title, artist, album, track number, and genre. These tags are embedded within the MP3 file, either at the beginning or the end of the file. This allows media players and other audio software to read and display relevant information about the audio track during playback or when organizing and categorizing audio files in a user's music library. MP3 decoders, on the other hand, are responsible for converting the compressed MP3 data into an audio waveform that can be played back by speakers or other audio output devices. This decoding process requires understanding the structure of an MP3 file, including how frames are organized and how to interpret different bits of data within the file. When an MP3 decoder encounters tag information that it is not programmed to extract, it disregards the data as nonessential information. This is because, from the perspective of audio playback, the metadata of an MP3 file does not contribute to the actual decoding process that generates the audio waveform. Thus, the decoder can safely ignore any tag data it does not understand or is not programmed to handle without affecting the playback quality of the audio. In some instances, MP3 decoders may be designed to be more robust by implementing additional logic to recognize and discard different types of tag data. This can help ensure that the decoder remains compatible with a wide range of MP3 files and adheres to various tagging standards that may be employed by different audio software. In summary, if MP3 decoders do not extract information from the tags, they treat the tags as ignorable, non-MP3 junk data. This means that the decoders focus on processing the primary MP3 frame data to produce the audio waveform, without affecting the playback quality. Tags are primarily used by media players and audio software to organize, categorize, and display information about audio files, while MP3 decoders' main priority is to accurately decode and reproduce the audio content of those files."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The album was released in April 1982 on MCA Records and was produced by Tom Collins. It was Barbara Mandrell's first studio album in two years since the release of \\"Love Is Fair\\". Can we infer the following? Barbara Mandrell produced a lot of albums","completion":"To determine whether Barbara Mandrell produced a lot of albums, let's analyze the information provided: 1. \\"In Black and White\\" is her 12th studio album. 2. The album was released in April 1982. 3. It was her first studio album in two years since the release of \\"Love Is Fair.\\" Now, let's process this information step-by-step: Step 1: Assess the total number of albums so far. She has released 12 studio albums, including \\"In Black and White.\\" This is a considerable number of albums for an artist. Step 2: Determine the period in which these albums were produced. \\"In Black and White\\" was released in 1982, and it was her first album in two years. Therefore, \\"Love Is Fair\\" was released in 1980. Since \\"In Black and White\\" is her 12th album, she must have started producing albums before 1980. Step 3: Evaluate the frequency of album production. To verify if Barbara Mandrell produced a lot of albums, it's essential to consider the frequency of her album releases. We don't have the exact release dates for all her albums, but we know she released 12 albums by 1982, with a two-year gap between her 11th and 12th albums. Based on this information, we can infer that Barbara Mandrell was a prolific artist who produced a substantial number of albums. Although we do not know the exact frequency of her album releases, having 12 studio albums by 1982 indicates that she was quite active in her music career."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: is a description of how probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable?","completion":"A description of how probabilities are distributed over the values of a random variable is often referred to as a probability distribution. Probability distributions play a crucial role in the study of statistics and probability theory as they provide a method to represent and analyze uncertainties in data or processes. Probability distributions can be classified into two broad categories: 1. Discrete Probability Distributions: These distributions are used when a random variable can take only a finite or countably infinite number of distinct values. Some common examples include flipping a coin, rolling a die, or counting the number of defective items in a batch. Discrete probability distributions assign probabilities to individual outcomes or events. Some well-known discrete probability distributions are: a. Uniform Distribution: All the possible outcomes have an equal probability of occurring. For example, in a fair coin toss, the probability of getting a head or a tail is equal (1/2). b. Bernoulli Distribution: This distribution represents the probability of success or failure in a single trial. It can be used to model situations where only two outcomes are possible, such as yes/no or true/false. c. Binomial Distribution: It describes the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials with the same probability of success. For example, the probability of getting exactly three heads in five coin tosses. d. Poisson Distribution: This distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given that the events are rare and unpredictable. For example, the number of phone calls received at a call center in an hour. 2. Continuous Probability Distributions: These distributions are used when a random variable can take any value in a continuous range, such as measurements like height, weight, or temperature. Continuous probability distributions are described by probability density functions (PDFs), which determine the shape of the distribution curve and provide the probability of a random variable taking a value within a specific range. Some well-known continuous probability distributions are: a. Uniform Distribution: The continuous uniform distribution assigns equal probability to all the values within a given range. For example, the probability of a person's height being between 5' and 6' is the same as between 6' and 7'. b. Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution): It is a bell-shaped distribution that occurs naturally in many phenomena, such as biological measurements, social sciences, and physical sciences. The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean (µ), which indicates the central location of the distribution; and the standard deviation (σ), which represents the spread of the distribution. c. Exponential Distribution: This distribution models the waiting time between successive events in a Poisson process. For example, the time between two buses arriving at a bus stop. d. Log-Normal Distribution: It is a distribution whose logarithm is normally distributed. It can model variables that are always positive and have a skewed distribution, such as stock prices or lifetimes of products. Understanding probability distributions and their properties is essential for statistical inference, prediction, quality control, and decision-making in a wide range of fields, including finance, engineering, physics, social sciences, and biology. By using the probability distributions, we can estimate the likelihood of observing particular outcomes or values and make better decisions based on the available data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - thyroid - pituitary gland - medulla - the hypothalamus A: A:","completion":"The sensors for thermoregulation are predominantly concentrated in the hypothalamus of the brain. The hypothalamus plays a crucial role in maintaining the body's temperature within a normal range by acting as a thermostat for the body. This region of the brain is responsible for detecting fluctuations in body temperature and making adjustments accordingly to maintain a stable internal environment, known as homeostasis. In order to regulate body temperature, the hypothalamus receives information from various thermoreceptors located throughout the body. These thermoreceptors are sensitive nerve cells that detect changes in temperature and send signals back to the hypothalamus. They can be categorized as either central or peripheral. Central thermoreceptors are found within the hypothalamus and the spinal cord, while peripheral thermoreceptors are located in the skin, mucous membranes, and deep tissues. When the hypothalamus detects a change in body temperature, it initiates various physiological responses to correct the imbalance. For instance, if the body is too warm, the hypothalamus triggers vasodilation, which is the widening of blood vessels to allow increased blood flow to the skin surface. This results in increased heat loss and thus helps to lower body temperature. Conversely, if the body is too cold, the hypothalamus triggers vasoconstriction, which is the narrowing of blood vessels to reduce blood flow to the skin surface. This conserves heat and reduces heat loss. Additionally, the hypothalamus can activate shivering, which is the involuntary contraction of muscles that generates heat as a byproduct, thus raising body temperature. Although the hypothalamus is the primary region for thermoregulation, other parts of the brain may also be involved in processing temperature information and generating response mechanisms. For example, the medulla and the pituitary gland can regulate hormones that may have an impact on thermoregulation, such as thyroid hormones and vasopressin. In summary, the sensors for thermoregulation are primarily concentrated in the hypothalamus of the brain, which receives temperature information from a variety of thermoreceptors located both centrally and peripherally. The hypothalamus then coordinates the necessary physiological responses to maintain a stable internal temperature, ensuring proper body function and overall health."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

No A:","completion":"B). No The correct answer to the question \\"what soil helps a plant grow?\\" is not \\"support.\\" Instead, it is \\"loose soil,\\" as stated in the given information. Loose soil helps plants grow, develop, and expand because it provides several benefits that are essential to their growth process. Some of the key benefits of loose soil include: 1. Improved aeration: Loose soil allows air to penetrate it easily. Adequate aeration is vital for the overall health and growth of plants, as it ensures that plant roots have access to the oxygen they need for respiration and other metabolic processes. 2. Enhanced drainage: Loose soil typically has better drainage, which prevents waterlogging and root rot. Excess water can damage or kill plants by suffocating their roots and promoting the growth of pathogens and diseases. 3. Easy root penetration and proliferation: Loose soil is less compact and offers less resistance to root growth, making it easier for plants to extend their root systems. This results in stronger plants with better anchorage, increased access to water and nutrients, and an enhanced ability to tolerate stress. 4. Enhanced nutrient uptake: Loose soil allows for easier nutrient penetration, leading to better absorption of essential nutrients by plant roots. Well-nourished plant roots promote healthy, vigorous growth and increased resistance to diseases and pests. 5. Promotes beneficial organisms: Loose soil provides a favorable environment for beneficial soil organisms like earthworms, beneficial bacteria, and fungi. These organisms help decompose organic matter, releasing nutrients into the soil, and improve soil structure, which makes it even more conducive to plant growth and health. To sum up, the correct answer to the question \\"what soil helps a plant grow?\\" is loose soil, as it offers better aeration, enhanced drainage, easy root penetration, improved nutrient uptake, and an environment that supports biological activities beneficial to plant growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where are the cousins of the species of nukupuʻ located other than the oldest of the main Hawaiian Islands? Answer:","completion":"The cousins of the species of Nukupu'u (scientific name: Hemignathus lucidus) are primarily found within the Hawaiian archipelago, specifically in the main Hawaiian Islands and some of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. The Nukupu'u itself belongs to the family Fringillidae and is part of the group of birds known as Hawaiian honeycreepers. To understand the distribution of the close relatives of Nukupu'u, we first need to examine the characteristics that define the genus Hemignathus and then look at other genera that share similar traits. The genus Hemignathus comprises four species, all endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. These species are: 1. Nukupu'u (Hemignathus lucidus) - As mentioned earlier, this species is found on the oldest of the main Hawaiian Islands. 2. Akiapola'au (Hemignathus munroi) - This species is found on the Big Island of Hawaii, mostly in the wet and mesic forests of Hakalau and Kilauea. 3. Greater Koa-Finch (Hemignathus ellisianus) - This now-extinct species was historically present on both Maui and the Big Island. 4. Lesser Koa-Finch (Hemignathus affinis) - Another extinct species, this bird was only ever known from the island of Maui. Apart from Hemignathus, there are several other genera within the Hawaiian honeycreepers that are considered cousins of Nukupu'u due to similar morphological features, behavior, and feeding habits. Some of these genera include: 1. Loxops - This genus comprises four species of small honeycreepers, known as 'akepas, found on different Hawaiian Islands: - Hawai'i 'Akepa (Loxops coccineus) - Big Island of Hawaii - O'ahu 'Akepa (Loxops wolstenholmei) - Island of O'ahu, currently considered critically endangered - Maui 'Akepa (Loxops ochraceus) - Island of Maui, believed to be extinct - Kaua'i 'Akepa (Loxops sclateri) - Island of Kaua'i, conservation status is critically endangered 2. Chlorodrepanis - This genus consists of three species of honeycreepers known as ʻamakihis: - Hawai'i 'Amakihi (Chlorodrepanis virens) - Big Island of Hawaii - O'ahu 'Amakihi (Chlorodrepanis flava) - Island of O'ahu - Kaua'i 'Amakihi (Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri) - Island of Kaua'i 3. Akialoa - This extinct genus comprises four species of long-billed honeycreepers, which were spread across different Hawaiian Islands: - O'ahu 'Akialoa (Akialoa ellisiana) - Island of O'ahu - Kaua'i 'Akialoa (Akialoa stejnegeri) - Island of Kaua'i - Maui 'Akialoa (Akialoa lanaiensis) - Islands of Maui, Moloka'i, and Lāna'i - Hawai'i 'Akialoa (Akialoa obscurus) - Big Island of Hawaii In conclusion, the cousins of the species of Nukupu'u can be found on various islands within the Hawaiian archipelago, including the main Hawaiian Islands such as Big Island, Maui, O'ahu, Kaua'i, Moloka'i, and Lāna'i, as well as some of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. These relatives mainly belong to the genera Hemignathus, Loxops, Chlorodrepanis, and Akialoa. While some of these species are still thriving, others have already gone extinct or are facing critical endangerment due to habitat loss, invasive species, and diseases. Conservation efforts are vital to preserving the unique biodiversity of Hawaiian honeycreepers and their ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Blood vessels help regulate body processes by either constricting (becoming narrower) or dilating (becoming wider). These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract. This reduces the amount of blood that can flow through the vessels (see Figure below ). Dilation occurs when the walls relax. This increases blood flows through the vessels. Now, I have a new situation: Greg is a physician working for the city hospital. Today he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B.

Question: Who is the Chief of Detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department? Movie plot title: It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World Movie plot: \\"Smiler\\" Grogan (Jimmy Durante), an ex-convict wanted by police in a tuna factory robbery fifteen years ago and currently on the run, careens his 1957 Ford Fairlane off twisting, mountainous State Highway 74 near Palm Springs in Southern California and crashes. Five motorists stop to help him: Melville Crump (Sid Caesar), a dentist; Lennie Pike (Jonathan Winters), a furniture mover; Dingy Bell (Mickey Rooney) and Benjy Benjamin (Buddy Hackett), two friends on their way to Las Vegas; and J. Russell Finch (Milton Berle), an entrepreneur who owns Pacific Edible Seaweed Company in Fresno. Just before he dies (literally kicking a bucket), Grogan tells the five men about 350,000 buried in Santa Rosita State Park near the Mexican border under \\"The Big W\\". Initially, the motorists try to reason with each other and share the money, but it soon becomes an all out race to get the money first. Unbeknownst to them all, Captain T.G. Culpeper (Spencer Tracy), Chief of Detectives of the Santa Rosita Police Department, has been patiently working on the Smiler Grogan case for years, hoping to someday solve it and retire. When he learns of the fatal crash, he suspects that Grogan may have tipped off the passersby, so he has them tracked by various police units. His suspicions are confirmed by their behavior. Everyone experiences multiple setbacks on their way to the money. Crump and his wife Monica (Edie Adams) charter an old WWI-era Jenny biplane and eventually make it to Santa Rosita, but are soon unknowingly locked in the basement of a hardware store by its owner (Edward Everett Horton).

Both sentences convey the same core information, which is that the Pascu River is a tributary of the Valea Voenilor River. The differences in the statements' formulations, such as the change in capitalization of \\"river\\" in River Pascu/Pascu River and the slight variations in order of the words, do not have a significant impact on the meaning being communicated.

A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). There was a soccer match between Red team and Blue team. Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game.

These services can include bill payment options, voter registration, and more. Public buildings are constructed with the purpose of facilitating the efficient functioning of public services and maintaining a pleasant and functional environment for both employees and visitors. The other options provided are not as fitting for the description given in the question: 1. Thunderdome: A thunderdome refers to a large, domed arena or venue typically used for various events such as concerts, sports, or competitive activities. While the reference to a hallway in the question might suggest an elaborate entrance or concourse, the main function of a thunderdome is not to facilitate paying bills or voter registration. 2. Access rooms: This term is relatively vague but could refer to rooms used to provide access to certain facilities or equipment. Access rooms can be found in various types of buildings. However, they generally do not have a central passage where you can pay bills or register to vote. 3. Tomb: A tomb is a place for housing the remains of deceased individuals, often constructed with beautiful architecture and artistic flourishes. Despite the possible presence of a grand hallway, its primary function is as a burial site and not for public services related to bill payment or voter registration. 4. Arena: An arena is a large, enclosed space designed for sporting events, concerts, or other performances. While you might find a big arched hallway as part of an arena's architectural design, the primary purpose of this type of structure is to host events, not to provide public services such as paying bills or registering to vote. Given the options, a public building is the most fitting answer to the question as it would be a place where you could find a central passage for people to pay their bills or register to vote.

Huxley wanted science to be secular, without religious interference, and his article in the April 1860 Westminster Review promoted scientific naturalism over natural theology, praising Darwin for \\"extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated\\" and coining the term \\"Darwinism\\" as part of his efforts to secularise and professionalise science.

I transferred my new photos from the memory card into the hard drive until the","completion":"screen suddenly blinked, interrupting the process. A split second later, the screen went entirely black, leaving me in a state of confusion and panic. My heart raced as I tried to figure out what could have gone wrong. I had spent countless hours taking those photos, exploring hidden gems in the city, winding through alleys, and capturing stunning landscapes during golden hour. The thought of losing them all was unbearable. Determined to find a solution, I immediately started exploring all the possible causes, hoping it was a minor technical glitch that I could fix myself. I unplugged and reconnected all the cords, and even tried turning the computer off and back on again, but nothing seemed to work. The screen remained stubbornly blank. Feeling helpless and desperate, I decided to search for answers on my phone. After scouring online forums and articles, I came across a similar issue other photographers had experienced. The consensus was to try data recovery software, but there were mixed reviews on their effectiveness. Still, giving it a try seemed to be my best option. I quickly downloaded one of the recommended programs and followed the instructions. While the software did its work, I paced nervously around the room, envisioning my lost photos, each one a memory frozen in time. An hour passed, and then another. Just as I started to lose hope, my computer screen flickered back to life. A message appeared on the screen, stating that the software had managed to recover 87% of my lost photos. My heart soared with relief and gratitude. I spent the next hour carefully reviewing the recovered images, finding many of my favorites among them. The fact that I had lost some photos stung, but I resolved to learn from this experience and take precautions in the future. Investing in more reliable storage, backing up my work on multiple platforms, and researching ways to properly maintain my computer became my top priorities. Besides, some of the photos that were lost served as a reminder to appreciate the fleeting beauty of those captured moments and the transient nature of life itself. Over the next few weeks, I slowly rebuilt my photography portfolio, curating the recovered images into various collections. I reached out to fellow photographers in the community and participated in local exhibitions to showcase my work. Each conversation I had with fellow artists about photography was filled with lessons on best practices for securing and preserving our treasured images. Realizing the importance of sharing my experience, I began documenting my journey through a blog. I wrote about the fear and anxiety I felt during this ordeal and how it transformed into a valuable learning experience. The response from my readers was overwhelmingly positive, with many expressing gratitude for sharing my story, as it had inspired them to ensure their memories were properly protected. As I continued to share my experiences and learn from others, I became more involved in the photography community. I participated in workshops, conferences, and photo walks. My photography skills improved, and so did my understanding of crucial safety measures within the digital world. Eventually, I combined my passion for photography and newfound knowledge of data preservation to launch a workshop dedicated to helping photographers secure their work. The incident that had once filled me with terror and despair ultimately became the catalyst for personal growth, new friendships, and a rewarding career. Had it not been for that fateful day, I may have never discovered the potential and resilience within myself.

Prince Harry and Sentebale ambassador Joss Stone at the summer party. Among the stars at tonight’s glitzy event was singer Joss Stone, who recently visited some of the charity’s projects in Africa and will entertain fellow guests. Other star turns include magician Troy and singer Beverley Knight. Harry's cousin Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn were among the guests as were Westlife singer Kian Egan and wife actress Jodi Albert. The evening will also see Harry give a short speech and hand out awards honouring key individuals and organisations that have supported his charity over the past decade. The seed of Sentebale was first planted in 2004 when the prince spent two months in the impoverished African kingdom of Lesotho during his gap year. He had been invited to visit the land-locked country located within South Africa by a member of its ruling family, Prince Seeiso, a friend of his mentor, ex-army officer Mark Dyer. The young prince leant in for a kiss as he arrived at the summer bash for the charity, which also works with disadvantaged children in the African kingdom of Lesotho. The evening will also see Harry give a short speech and hand out awards honouring key individuals and organisations that have supported his charity over the past decade. The charismatic prince addresses the crowds at the tenth celebrations for Sentebale. The organisation's name - chosen by Harry - is a poignant tribute to his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, who was killed in a car crash in 1997, and points to Harry's drive to ensure both the princess and the children of Lesotho are never forgotten. According to latest statistics, some 23 per cent of the country's entire population - around 360,000 people - are infected with HIV. Of that, 38,000 are believed to be children. Sentebale founding patron Prince Seeiso Bereng Seeiso and Prince Harry speak on stage during the Sentebale Summer Party. The experience made a lasting impression on the young royal, who was then aged 19. Not only did Harry come face-to-face with hundreds of Aids orphans but he also visited herd boys living a harsh existence in remote mountain areas looking after cattle. Two years later he returned to set up the charity Sentebale - which means forget me not in the local Basotho dialect - with Prince Seeiso to help youngsters in need.

Diana, pictured in 1990, was a tireless campaigner for Aids victims. The evening opened with an enchanting performance by the Basotho Choir who sung a selection of traditional songs punctuated with warbling cries Prince Seeiso opened proceedings and talked of his 'beautiful, mountainous landlocked country' - but one that had been ravaged by poverty and disease.He spoke about Harry's first visit to Lesotho and how they had travelled to the 'furthest reaches' of the country to visit children orphaned by Aids. 'Harry and I know what it is like to lose a parent, or parents in my case, and it is a combined desire to carry on our mothers' legacy of work that formed Sentebale,' he said. He also revealed that Harry had been given a Lesotho name on the day he arrived in the country - Mohale, which means hero. In his speech Harry highlighted the ravages of the HIV/Aids epidemic which has left Lesotho with the third highest infection rate in the world and one in three of its children orphans. He admitted: 'At times the severity of severe poverty can be overwhelming. 'However it is through the dedication, passion and commitment of the Sentebale team, our community partners, local government - the children's longing to learn - and you tonight that we are battling with these issues and giving these children a chance of a happier future.' The prince highlighted the case of a young girl called Mpolokeng, whom he met in 2001 and whose mother died of Aids shortly afterwards leaving her to care for her siblings. Thanks to Sentebale's help she has been receiving a £250 annual bursary to attend school.'That really is a small price to pay to change a little girl's life,' he said. 'What a difference we can make if we all work together.' Guests at the event dined on rump of lamb with cauliflower brûlée, minted pea with baby gem and braised lamb pie and a trio of flaming vanilla creme brûlée, mango sorbet and strawberry pavlova. Westlife singer Kian Egan said of the night: 'Let's face it, if you get an invite from Prince Harry you don't say no. But my wife and I are hugely proud to be here to support his work. It's a remarkable charity.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Prince Harry attended a summer party at the Dorchester Hotel in London to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his charity, Sentebale, which works with AIDS orphans and disadvantaged children in Lesotho. The charity was co-founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, a member of Lesotho's ruling family. The event featured performances by singer Joss Stone, magician Troy, and singer Beverley Knight. Prince Harry gave a speech and handed out awards recognizing key supporters of Sentebale. The charity's name is a tribute to Princess Diana and represents Prince Harry's drive to ensure that her memory and the children of Lesotho are not forgotten. Sentebale has a nationwide program of education and support and is also raising funds to build the Mamohato Children's Centre to support children affected by HIV and AIDS."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Problem: Solve -12*v - 45*v + 377 = 816 - 5227 for v. And the answer is...","completion":"Okay, first you must know that 'v' here stands for a unknown value, like a hidden treasure we must find! We start by combining all the 'v's together. So -12*v - 45*v would become -57*v , like if you have lost 12 toys and then lost 45 more, you have lost 57 toys in total. Then we simplify 816 - 5227 which is negative number because 5227 is bigger than 816. So it will be -4411, like if you had 816 candies but ate 5227, you would owe 4411 candies. So, now we have -57*v + 377 = -4411. Let's take 377 to the other side by subtracting 377 from both sides, like when you give away 377 of your toys. Then you will have -57*v = -4411 - 377, which is -4788. Now, to get the value of 'v', imagine you have -57 pieces of a big cookie that equal -4788 crumbs, and we want to know how many crumbs is one piece of cookie worth. We divide -4788 crumbs by -57 pieces of cookie. So, 'v' is 4788 divided by 57, which is approximately 84.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Traders will watch this, but Fed can't rewrite history Read More Why oil could revisit its lows and then some Markets, however, will hear from another Fed speaker Wednesday. San Francisco Fed President John Williams speaks at 2 p.m. on the outlook. The markets were preoccupied last month by the potential timing of the Fed's first rate hike, but now have switched gears to worrying about China and Greece. As those events have became perceived as potentially more negative, traders added to bets in the futures market that the Fed would not hike rates until early next year. At this point, Briggs said RBS calculates the market is expecting the first full rate hike in January, and sees just a 22 percent chance of a rate increase in September. The Fed minutes shouldn't change the perception of the market, but Yellen's talk on the economy at midday Friday might. Briggs said the Fed statement after that June meeting was neutral, and the minutes should be as well. \\"I think it's going to sound like a watch and wait Fed,\\" he said. Read More This list of 'junk' companies keeps getting longer Stock futures were lower Wednesday, after another nearly 6 percent rout in Chinese stocks overnight. European equities reversed earlier losses after Greece submitted new proposals seeking a debt deal. Wall Street staged a big reversal Tuesday with equities closing higher, after a choppy day of trading on news related to Greece. The fact the euro group will meet Sunday and look at Greek debt sustainability gave the markets encouragement. \\"It was wild and woolly and some of it was technical,\\" said Art Cashin, director of floor operations at the New York Stock Exchange for UBS. Cashin said the reversal of a sharp intraday drop in oil also helped stocks, but developments on Greece became the bigger driver, including an unsubstantiated rumor that it was being given a 30-day reprieve. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is expected to submit a loan request and reform proposals Wednesday, and the proposals will be reviewed to see if Greece can receive some short term funding. Read More Grexit would be 'beginning of the end' of euro: Piketty Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said stocks are caught in a volatile pattern while investors await the outcome for Greece and China. \\"We may be within a 24-hour window of having a little more information on Greece. That would at least partly answer one of those questions and uncertainties,\\" she said. China could be the more difficult situation to read. The Shanghai stock market sold off again Tuesday, even after the government took steps to stop it. That spooked the oil market and commodities in general, as traders feared a bigger economic slowdown spreading out from the equities meltdown. \\"Some of what they're doing is a little bit scary,\\" said Sonders. Read More Oil rout dashes hopes of reprieve for some drillers \\"They say they want to go to a more market based set of principles, especially around the stock market,\\" she said. \\"You get a 30 percent drop in the stock market and they step in, in command and control mode. They ban shorting and actually are exacerbating the problem…It just shows as reform minded as they like to be, when faced with a near term crisis, their default is to step in and micro manage.\\" Sonders said the situation in China could turn into a bullish story if it signals the leadership that they have to move more quickly on reforms. \\"This could be the pause that refreshes,\\" she said. But it could also spread. \\"A continued plunge in Chinese stocks is a negative for the U.S. market,\\" she said. Sonders said Schwab is neutral on the market this year, expecting it to make much smaller gains than prior years. But she recommends investors keep a position in equities, both domestic and international. The upcoming earnings season will be important, but the fact that the dollar has been driven higher by European events and oil has been slammed by China and Greece are negatives. Read More This chart shows U.S. stocks dependent on China Alcoa reports earnings after the close Wednesday, one of the first major reports of the season. Pepsico follows on Thursday, and then a flood of reports are scheduled for next week. \\"We're back in some of the same factors that caused a rumble in Q1 earnings,\\" Sonders said. While it will not impact the earnings reports for the second quarter, company comments for the third quarter or beyond could be negative because of the oil plunge or strong dollar. \\"So then the earnings recession story gets legs again,\\" she said. Stocks should trade in a volatile way but she does not see a panic from any of the catalysts. \\"Barring a more significant catalyst, other than this torture of news that we're getting out of both Greece and watching China scramble…I think it's more of the same in the market,\\" she said. As for oil, West Texas International crude futures closed down just 20 cents Tuesday at 52.33 per barrel, after falling to a key psychological level just above 50. \\"I think it could be a short covering rally,\\" said John Kilduff of Again Capital. Oil fell nearly 8 percent Monday as traders watched for developments on China and Greece. Iran was also a catalyst, as negotiations on its nuclear program continue, even as it appeared the latest deadline of July 9 would not be met. An agreement would mean an end of sanctions that could eventually put up to one million barrels of Iranian oil onto an already oversupplied market.

Answer a question about this article: In Majorcan, unstressed vowels reduce to four: /a e ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern; however /o ɔ/ reduce to [o], with /u/ remaining distinct, as in Western Catalan. What other pattern do other vowels follow?","completion":"This article primarily discusses the vowel reduction patterns in the Majorcan dialect of Catalan, specifically focusing on the unstressed vowels. It provides information on how the unstressed vowels reduce to four distinct sounds by following different reduction patterns in Eastern and Western Catalan. In Majorcan, the unstressed vowels /a e ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan vowel reduction pattern, which leads to a distinctive pronunciation in this dialect. Eastern Catalan vowel reduction involves the merging of /a/, /e/, and /ɛ/ into a centralized vowel [ə] in unstressed positions. This process produces a schwa-like sound, which is commonly found in many other languages. Eastern Catalan, therefore, focuses more on the reduction of front and central vowels. On the other hand, the unstressed vowels /o ɔ/ in Majorcan reduce to [o] and /u/ remains distinct, as seen in Western Catalan. Western Catalan vowel reduction, as opposed to its Eastern counterpart, concentrates more on the harmonization and reduction of back vowels, which include /o/, /ɔ/, and /u/. The article does not explicitly provide information on other patterns that unstressed vowels follow in other Catalan dialects or languages. However, it is important to note that vowel reduction is a common phenomenon across various languages and dialects, and different languages may have their own unique patterns and rules for how unstressed vowels are affected. In summary, this article discusses the vowel reduction patterns in the Majorcan dialect of Catalan. The unstressed vowels /a e ɛ/ follow the Eastern Catalan reduction pattern, while /o ɔ/ reduce to [o] and /u/ remains distinct according to the Western Catalan pattern. Although the article does not offer specific information on other reduction patterns in other dialects or languages, it highlights the unique characteristics of the Majorcan dialect that set it apart from the other dialects within the Catalan language family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eddie Mansius, left, Cullen McMillian, Nick Rhyne, Duncan Rule and Maddie Moore have had 4.5 million views of their 10 installments of “The Hunger Games.” Cullen joined the original four North Carolina high school students after the first video. (John W. Adkisson / For the Los Angeles Times / ) CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Duncan Rule discovered \\"The Hunger Games\\" shortly after the novel came out four years ago. He recommended it to Eddie Mansius, his best friend since seventh grade. Eddie urged Nick Rhyne and Maddie Moore to read it. Maddie devoured the book, which meshes a teenage coming-of-age story with reality TV and war, in three days. \\"It was like I never wanted it to end,\\" said Maddie, who went to YouTube and was disappointed to find a movie hadn't been made. She and her three friends, high school sophomores at the time, decided to make their own. Maddie played Katniss, the 16-year-old heroine who is forced to fight other children to the death for the entertainment of a vapid futuristic society. Nick played Gale, the heroine's love interest; Eddie portrayed Peeta, a former schoolmate of Katniss' who teams up with her in the arena. Friends and family members were enlisted to round out the cast. Their budget starting out: 30. When they needed to shoot interiors, they used Duncan's home in Charlotte's Eastover neighborhood. Exteriors were shot at Maddie's family farm an hour north of Charlotte, or at the park down the street from Eddie's house. Costumes came from Goodwill or their own closets. After their first video and subsequent installments went live on the Internet, they were on their way to becoming celebrities. These days, the friends — minus Duncan, who is camera shy — get stopped in all sorts of places; outside the Sprint store, at Wendy's and at summer camp. Nick was recognized while on vacation with his family in Turks and Caicos Islands in the Bahamas. Even the new girl at their school who arrived from Ireland last year had seen the videos. \\"Don't I know you from somewhere?\\" she said to Eddie and Maddie in an honors French class. Last spring Eddie, Maddie and Nick were invited to ConCarolinas, a science fiction convention in Charlotte, to sit on panels including \\"Film Directing 101\\" and \\"Everything You Wanted to Know About Filmmaking.\\" Then they entered an overflowing screening room and watched their videos on a big movie screen for the first time. It was billed as their North American premiere. On a recent Saturday evening, Eddie and his friends gathered outside Duncan's house to shoot a sequence from \\"Catching Fire,\\" the second book in the trilogy. The scene involves Katniss stumbling up the steps of the house and falling into Gale's waiting arms. Duncan lighted the scene with a 40 LED video light. Cullen McMillian, a friend of Eddie's, held a makeshift boom built from a shotgun microphone attached to a broken camera tripod. Eddie, who directs the videos, looked down at his camera. \\"This isn't going to work,\\" he said. \\"Duncan, make sure to follow her with the light. Cullen, you don't need to do boom because there is no dialogue in this scene. Maddie, walk slower this time.\\" Two more takes and the scene was done. They put it on YouTube on Jan. 4. The feature film version is scheduled to come out in November. So far, the group has written, produced, edited and starred in 10 videos based on the \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy, each about eight minutes long and posted on YouTube under the name L4gMast3Rz. The teenagers posted their first video in December 2010, more than a year before Hollywood's first film came out. That episode was quickly picked up by the \\"Hunger Games\\" fan site Mockingjay.net and in less than a week was viewed 6,000 times. The friends were so excited they filmed a video thanking their fans for watching it. It has become easier for amateur productions to find an audience beyond indulgent friends and relatives. Sites such as YouTube and Vimeo give even the most amateur backyard auteur access to millions of viewers. Today, the friends' DIY videos altogether have been viewed more than 4.5 million times. Their videos are popular, but the friends haven't made any money from them. \\"YouTube said they would send us a check when we hit a certain threshold from the advertising on our videos, but that hasn't happened yet,\\" Eddie said. It's not unusual for high school friends to make home movies. Steven Spielberg made his first film as a teenager in 1958. He used a Super 8 camera. Soon the family camcorder became popular. Now, inexpensive digital cameras and desktop editing software can let any teen produce polished videos. The friends are embarrassed by their early videos, shot with their parents' camcorders in fall 2010. The sound is a bit muffled, and the picture quality isn't great, but there are moments of beauty — the shots of nature that run behind the credits, a close up of Maddie's fingers worrying the rim of a water bottle as her character contemplates her next move. \\"Production value doesn't matter if a video captures the spirit of the books,\\" says Crystal Watanabe, an administrator at Mockingjay.net. \\"Our audience just wants to relive the feeling they had when they were reading the books for the first time.\\" With homework, extracurricular and family commitments, the friends, now seniors at Charlotte County Day School, don't have a lot of time to shoot these movies. Filming goes quickly when it's just Maddie, Eddie or Nick in a scene, but with guest actors, the results can be mixed. Eddie was directing a somber scene on a Sunday morning from the second book with Maddie's mother and 10-year-old sister, who play Katniss' mother and sister. They were watching President Snow, the villain, announce that 24 previous victors, including Katniss, would be heading back to the arena to fight, once again, to the death. But whenever Eddie pointed the camera at Maddie's mom and sister, they started to giggle. \\"Imagine your cat dying,\\" Eddie said, trying to get them to look appropriately depressed. \\"Stare off at a point and try to blur it with your eyes,\\" Maddie said. It took 20 minutes, but finally Eddie ended up with footage he could use. Then he shot Maddie looking grave. She nailed it in one take. Over the years the group has learned that their fans — mostly tween girls — demand adherence to the source material. \\"When we started we were writing the scripts from memory, and our fans would write in if even one word was different from the book,\\" Eddie said. Now he will re-shoot a scene if one of his actors misses even a single word. The friends are graduating high school in June and hope to make at least one more \\"Hunger Games\\" video from the third book, \\"Mockingjay,\\" before they head their separate ways in the fall. Their venture has been rewarding in many ways: Eddie was admitted early to Brown University, and he thinks his essay on making the videos made a difference. Maddie had an especially exciting payoff: She was cast as an extra in the Hollywood version of \\"The Hunger Games,\\" which was being filmed a few hours away from Charlotte, when several people on the set, including director Gary Ross, recognized her. \\"You're the girl from YouTube,\\" Ross said. Then he moved her to stand shoulder to shoulder with Jennifer Lawrence, who played Katniss, in the reaping scene where a group of gray-faced children gather to see who will be selected to fight in the arena. \\"You can see almost my whole body in profile except my face,\\" Maddie said. \\"Although you can see my face for half a second.\\" Her friends were thrilled. deborah.netburn@latimes.com ||||| North Carolina State Archives and State Library of North CarolinaArchive-It Partner Since: Sep, 2005Organization Type: State Archives & LibrariesOrganization URL: http://webarchives.ncdcr.gov The mission of the North Carolina Office of Archives and History is to collect, preserve, and utilize the state's historic resources so that present and future residents may better understand their history.

Q:Background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature... Paragraph: Frank and Noah were two researchers.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which researcher observed a stronger warming in spring? A:","completion":"Noah, the researcher who studied the climate of Antarctica, observed a stronger warming in spring.

Answer the above question based on the context below: At the court in Ferrara, a collection of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, which led to the formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. This preliminary group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to the court in 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers. The Duke did not announce the creation of a professional, all-female ensemble; instead, the group infiltrated and gradually dominated the musica secreta, so that after the dismissal of Brancaccio for insubordination in 1583, no more male members of the musica secreta were hired. Even when Brancaccio was performing with the consort it was referred to as a ladies' ensemble, because women singing together was the most exciting aspect of the group. This new ensemble, the concerto delle donne, was created by Alfonso in part to amuse his young new wife, Margherita Gonzaga d'Este (she was only fourteen when they wed in 1579), and in part to help the Duke achieve his artistic goals for the court. According to Grana, a contemporary correspondent, \\"Signora Machiavella [Lucrezia], Signora Isabella, and Signora Vittoria have abandoned the field, having lost the backing of Luzzaschi\\". The first recorded performance by the professional ladies was on November 20, 1580; by carnival season in 1581, they were performing together regularly.This new \\"consort of ladies\\" was viewed as an extraordinary and novel phenomenon; most witnesses did not connect the second period of the concerto delle donne with the group of ladies who sang in...

Networking: Be open to creating new connections with your coworkers in your department and throughout the organization. Attend any welcome events or team gatherings that will help you foster relationships and better integrate into the company culture. Second question answer: Entering Guaranty as a new employee requires a similar approach to the one mentioned previously, as the term \\"Guaranty\\" could be referring to a type of insurance or financial institution where you'd offer some type of guarantee. However, without knowing the specific company you are referring to, we will outline general aspects that new hires should be aware of when starting at a guaranty-related company. 1. Company Culture: Familiarize yourself with the organization's overall culture and values. Be prepared to contribute with a positive attitude and a commitment to collaboration. 2. Core Values: Research and understand the company's core values, such as customer service, integrity, innovation, and workplace diversity.

Both questions involve advice for someone starting a new job in a financially focused institution requiring a good understanding of the company, its products/services, as well as its culture and values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. and the situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Answer the following question: Which country would have higher labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","completion":"Based on the background information and the situation provided, the country that would have higher labour supply in response to their taxation would be Germany. The reasoning behind this lies in the Laffer curve theory. According to the Laffer curve, there is a certain tax rate above which the labour supply and thus, government revenue starts to decline. The idea is that if the tax rate is too high, people may feel discouraged from working overtime, or might seek to evade taxes, thus reducing the overall tax revenue for the government. In the cases of Germany and France post-World War II, you noted that Germany has chosen to implement a tax rate below this critical rate, while France chose a pro-socialist policy with a tax rate above the critical rate. Consequently, as per the theory of the Laffer curve, Germany would have created a more favourable climate for its labour market. The lower taxation rate would be more encouraging for workers to supply their labour, which would in turn potentially lead towards an increase in the government's tax revenue. On the contrary, in France, with its tax rate above the so-called 'critical rate', labour supply could have decreased as workers might feel their efforts are not being rewarded due to the heavy taxes, hence they may work less or find means to evade taxes. Therefore, based on the Laffer curve theory, Germany would presumably have a higher labour supply in response to their taxation policies than France."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chat Moss may be named after St Chad, a 7th-century bishop of Mercia, but as it was once part of a great tree-edged lake, as evidenced by the numerous wood remains in the lower levels of the peat, it is perhaps more likely that the name stems from the Celtic word ced, meaning wood. Chat Moss could also derive from Ceatta, an Old English personal name and mos, a swamp or alternatively the first element could be the Old English ceat meaning a piece of wet ground. It was recorded as Catemosse in 1277 and Chatmos in 1322. Moss is the local name for a peat bog.Daniel Defoe visited the area in 1724, on his way from Warrington to Manchester: From hence (Warrington), on the road to Manchester, we pass'd the great bog or waste call'd Chatmos, the first of that kind that we see in England ...

Qomolangma Mount Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest, has long been revered as the highest peak in the world. Towering above all others, the mountain has always been a symbol of purity, standing tall as a testament to the unspoiled land where it resides. It is here, amidst the breathtaking vistas and awe-inspiring landscapes, that one can truly appreciate the untouched beauty of our planet. The name Qomolangma has Tibetan roots, translating to \\"Mother Goddess of the Earth.\\" With its soaring height, eternal snow, and the challenge it presents to climbers, the mountain has rightfully earned this esteemed moniker. For centuries, it has been a sacred site for the Sherpa people and Tibetan Buddhists, who regard it as a sanctuary of the earth goddess, Chimy-ma-ri. As the world vies to conquer its peaks, the locals continue to uphold the sanctity and ritualistic practices that abound in this holy land. As various expeditions attempt to scale the mountain's heights, several measures have been taken to preserve its pristine nature. The Nepalese government, for instance, enforces strict rules and permits for climbers, ensuring that only those adequately equipped and prepared can embark on the risky ascent. Additionally, there is a powerful emphasis on the conservation and cleanliness of the mountain environment to protect its ecological balance. Every year, climbers from across the globe flock to the base of Qomolangma, each driven by their reasons and ambitions to reach its summit. However, true success does not lie merely in the physical accomplishment of conquering the peak. It is in the communion with nature, the respect for the mountain's history, and the insight into human limitations and potential. Climbers inevitably return with a renewed understanding of their place in the universe and the sanctity of the world's most revered peak. Moreover, the efforts to share and educate the world about the significance of preserving the purity and sanctity of Mt. Qomolangma have been a boon to both mountaineering and environmental conservation. Documentaries, movies, and literature have all sought to capture the mystique and allure of the mountain while also bringing awareness to the importance of maintaining its untouched splendor. In conclusion, Mt. Qomolangma, or Mount Everest, is far more than just the tallest peak on Earth. It stands as an enduring symbol of our planet's unblemished beauty, inspiring climbers and dreamers alike with its awe-inspiring magnificence. Let us continue to cherish and preserve the pure land that is Mount Qomolangma, and in doing so, we revere the Mother Goddess of the Earth and the majesty of our planet as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And this was the case for basketball star Yao Ming, who hosted a television show in Shanghai that raised US 300, 000 to help researchers find a cure for SARS. Fund-raising, or charity, is an act of goodwill towards others. Charities in the West have more ways. Look at a typical day for Ruth, a wealthy woman in the UK, for example. Ruth wakes up in the morning and collects her post. There's a letter addressed to her with a picture of a half-dead, beaten horse. It's from a charity asking Ruth to donate money to save the animals. The door bell rings and there, on Ruth's doorstep, is an old woman asking for money to help the aged. She turns on the television, hears sad music and sees a picture of a wide-eyed child dying of hunger in Africa with an appeal for money to help the child. Ruth then goes shopping for a dress to wear to that evening's large party for the rich and famous. The tickets for charity shows often cost her a large sum of money, but she doesn't mind because most of the money is going to a charity that fights AIDS. She feels good about going because she's helping the sick. Edna, a little old lady, looks after an old secondhand shop. Any profit it has made goes to a cancer charity. Now that she has retired, she has plenty of spare time to offer her services for free. www.ks5u.com For people like Yao Ming, Ruth and Edna, charity is a virtue that holds the same importance in life as faith and hope. \\"As you look back on your life, the moments that stand out are the moments when you have done things for others,\\" said Scottish author Henry Drummond.

Question: Information: - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - The Commodore PET (Personal Electronic Transactor) is a line of home/personal computers produced starting in 1977 by Commodore International. A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80. - The Commodore 128 , also known as the C128 , C - 128 , C = 128 , or occasionally CBM 128 , is the last 8 - bit home computer that was commercially released by Commodore Business Machines ( CBM ) . Introduced in January 1985 at the CES in Las Vegas , it appeared three years after its predecessor , the bestselling Commodore 64 . The C128 is a significantly expanded successor to the C64 , with nearly full compatibility . The newer machine has 128 kB of RAM in two 64 kB banks , and an 80 - column color video output . It has a redesigned case and keyboard . Also included is a Zilog Z80 CPU which allows the C128 to run CP / M , as an alternative to the usual Commodore BASIC environment . The presence of the Z80 and the huge CP / M software library it brings , coupled with the C64 's software library , gives the C128 one of the broadest ranges of available software among its competitors . The primary hardware designer of the C128 was Bil Herd , who had worked on the Plus / 4 . Other hardware engineers were Dave Haynie and Frank Palaia , while the IC design work was done by Dave DiOrio . The main Commodore system software was developed by Fred Bowen and Terry Ryan , while the CP / M subsystem was developed by Von Ertwine . - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - The IBM System/360 Model 30 was a low-end member of the IBM System/360 family. It was announced on April 7, 1964, shipped in 1965, and withdrawn on October 7, 1977. - The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a mainframe computer system family that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978.

At least 17 dead in Russian republic after suicide car bombing The injured included 10 people in critical condition and 90 in serious condition, health officials said. Investigators said the explosive device contained the equivalent of 40 kilograms of TNT. The bomb was placed inside a vehicle parked at the entrance to the central market in downtown Vladikavkaz, with a suicide bomber sitting inside the car, said the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office, which qualified the attack as a \\"terrorist act.\\" The device detonated at 11:20 a.m. (3:20 a.m. ET). The committee also said the bomb was stuffed with various pieces of metal to increase the human damage. A natural gas canister, stored in the car's trunk, also detonated, the committee said. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry is sending special medical planes to Vladikavkaz to airlift heavily injured patients to Moscow's leading trauma clinics. Friday was declared a day of national mourning in North Ossetia, according to a local government decree. Flags on all regional buildings will fly at half-staff and all entertainment programs on local TV will be cancelled as well as concerts and theater performances. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, speaking on national TV, pledged that all organizers of the deadly bombing will be identified and punished -- or killed. \\"We will do all we can to catch these monsters and animals ... who have committed a terror attack, a barbaric terror attack, against ordinary people. We will do all we can to find and punish them in accordance with the laws of our country, and we will destroy them if they offer resistance or in other circumstances,\\" Medvedev said. Meanwhile, the owner of the car used in the bomb attack has been identified and arrested, a local police official told the Interfax news agency. The detainee claims that he sold it to an unknown buyer on Wednesday, the policeman said. The Russian government announced each family of those killed will receive 1 million rubles in compensation (more than 32,000). Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also condemned the bombing, saying, \\"The crimes like the one that was committed in the North Caucasus today are aimed at sowing enmity between our citizens. We have no right to allow this.\\" North Ossetia and the rest of the Caucasus region have been plagued with violence and political instability. The market has seen other terrorist attacks in the past. In November 2008, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at a nearby bus station, killing 12 people and wounding more than 40. An explosion killed more than 50 people and wounded 300 in March 1999.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: At age 11, Ghulam was married off to 40-year-old Jaiz in a rural Afghan village, making her only one of more than 10 million young girls who are being forced to wed men old enough to be their fathers of grandfather every year. In an effort to start a global conversation about the devastating effects of early marriages, which are currently practiced in more than 50 developing countries, the United Nations designed October 11 as International Day of the Girl Child this year. Although child marriage is against the law in many countries, and international treaties forbid the practice, it is estimated that about 51 million girls below age 18 are currently married, often under the cover of darkness and in secret. In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 percent of girls wed before the legal age of 16. Various factors drive parents of child bridges to marry off their daughters, from the community's pressure to confirm to age-old cultural customs to economic considerations. In poor, developing nations, it is not uncommon for families to settle debts by offering their daughters as payment. Experts agree that early marriage denies the girl education and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by grownup responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household. In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse. Underage wives who are lucky enough to escape from their husbands end up living in poverty, or worse. Most girls who enter early marriages are expected to get pregnant right away, which often leads to tragedy for both the mothers, who are still children themselves, and their babies. Unless international organizations take steps to reverse the troubling trend, it is estimated that over the next decade, 100 million more girls--or about 25,000 girls a day ---will marry before they turn 18. To learn more about... The answer is:","completion":"Question: What are the consequences and contributing factors of child marriage, as discussed in the article? A. Child marriage is driven by cultural customs, economic considerations, and community pressure, and often denies girls education and childhood experiences. B. Child marriage occurs only in Afghanistan, and is mainly driven by the need to settle family debts. C. Child marriage has no significant impact on the lives of young girls, as they are well-prepared for adult responsibilities. D. Child marriage is encouraged by international treaties and is legal in most developing countries. Correct Answer: A. Child marriage is driven by cultural customs, economic considerations, and community pressure, and often denies girls education and childhood experiences. Explanation: According to the article, child marriage is practiced in over 50 developing countries, affecting more than 10 million young girls every year. The factors that contribute to child marriage include community pressure to conform to age-old cultural customs and economic considerations, such as settling debts by offering daughters as payment. The consequences of child marriage are often devastating, as it denies girls education and robs them of their childhood. Most young wives do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household, which can lead to vulnerability to domestic violence, and physical, sexual, and verbal abuse."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Six-Day War (Hebrew: מלחמת ששת הימים , \\"Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim\\"; Arabic: النكسة , \\"an-Naksah\\", \\"The Setback\\" or حرب ۱۹٦۷ , \\"Ḥarb 1967\\", \\"War of 1967\\"), also known as the June War, 1967 Arab–Israeli War, or Third Arab–Israeli War, was fought between June 5 and 10, 1967 by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt (known at the time as the United Arab Republic), Jordan, and Syria. Can we draw the following conclusion? The war caused much destruction.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the Six-Day War caused much destruction. The war was characterized by its short duration but intense combat, leading to significant losses in terms of human lives, infrastructure, and territorial changes. The conflict affected all the participating countries and their people, as well as the regional dynamics in the Middle East. Firstly, human lives were lost in substantial numbers during the war. It is estimated that around 20,000 soldiers from the Arab countries (Egypt, Jordan, and Syria) were either killed or wounded. Israel, despite its victory, also suffered casualties, with approximately 800 soldiers killed and over 2,000 wounded. In addition to military casualties, hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded in the crossfires, bombings, and military operations. Secondly, the war caused extensive damage to the infrastructure and economy of the involved countries. Israel's airforce targeted and destroyed multiple airfields in Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, along with their aircraft and other military equipment, significantly weakening their military capabilities. Additionally, damage was inflicted on other infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, telecommunications, power plants, and water supplies. These damages crippled the economies of the affected countries, diverting resources to try and compensate for the destruction. Thirdly, the territorial changes brought about by the war played a significant role in shaping the Middle East's landscape. As a result of its victory, Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria. These territorial gains had far-reaching consequences, notably, the displacement of thousands of Palestinians and Syrians from their homes. The occupation of these territories created a new source of tension and conflict in the region, contributing to numerous subsequent clashes and negotiations. Lastly, the Six-Day War had significant political consequences, leading to a change in power dynamics in the region. Israel's swift victory over much larger and seemingly more powerful Arab armed forces led to the perception of its military invincibility, changing the Arab-Israeli balance of power in Israel's favor. The war also magnified the animosity between Arab countries and Israel. Furthermore, it intensified the regional rivalry between Israel's primary military and political supporter, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which backed Egypt and Syria, further fueling the tensions associated with the Cold War. In conclusion, the Six-Day War caused much destruction in various aspects, including human lives, infrastructure, territorial changes, and political dynamics in the Middle East and beyond. The consequences of the war have had lasting effects on the region, shaping its ongoing conflicts and struggles for peace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What did Jafar transform himself into? Title: Aladdin Movie plot: A peddler sets up shop in the fictional sultanate of Agrabah, offering to tell the audience about the story of an oil lamp in his possession. Jafar, the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, and his parrot Iago, seek the lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders but is told that only a âdiamond in the roughâ may enter. Jafar identifies a street urchin named Aladdin as worthy. Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu cross paths with Princess Jasmine, who has run away from the palace, unwilling to be married off to another snobbish suitor. Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and fall in love, but Jafar has Aladdin apprehended, tricking Jasmine into thinking that he was decapitated. Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu, taking them to the Cave and promises to reward them if they retrieve the lamp. Inside, Aladdin befriends a magic carpet. Abu greedily tries to steal a jewel, despite the Caveâs request, and it collapses. Trapped underground, Aladdin rubs the lamp, releasing the Genie trapped inside, who explains Aladdin has become his master and will grant him three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the Cave without wasting a wish, and then uses his first to become a prince to be near Jasmine. Jafar, on Iagoâs suggestion, plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine, but Aladdin parades into the city as âPrince Ali of Ababwaâ. However, Jasmine is unimpressed with Aladdinâs bravado. Despite his friends advising him to tell Jasmine the truth, Aladdin refuses, believing she would never fall âfor some street ratâ. He takes Jasmine on a worldwide flight on the carpet, where she deduces his identity, though Aladdin says that he dresses as a peasant to escape the stresses of royal life, which convinces her. Aladdin returns Jasmine home, only to be attacked by the palace guards on Jafarâs orders and nearly drowned, until the Genie rescues him using his second wish.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Man Who Changed His Look to Visit the Swiss Embassy Once upon a time, there was a man who wanted to go to the Swiss embassy in a big city called Baku. Baku is the capital of a country named Azerbaijan. The Swiss embassy is like a little office where people from Switzerland work and help other people who want to visit or learn about their country. Now, this man really wanted to go to the embassy, but he wanted to look different while doing it. So, he decided to change the way he looked! Do you remember how Clark Kent turns into Superman by just changing his clothes and taking off his glasses? Just like that, this man also decided to change his hair color. He had beautiful dark hair, but he wanted to look more like people from Europe, so he dyed his hair blond. Have you ever seen people with different hair colors like red, blue, or pink? Sometimes people change their hair color to look cool or just for fun. This man did it to look more European while going to the Swiss embassy. So, with his new blond hair, the man went to the Swiss embassy in Baku. You might be wondering what happened when he got there. Did the people in the embassy believe he was European? We are not sure about that, but we know for sure that this man became famous for trying to change his appearance just to visit the Swiss embassy. In conclusion, this story teaches us that sometimes, people do unusual things, like changing their hair color or the way they look, for different reasons. But, it's most important to remember that no matter what we look like, we should always be true to who we are and be proud of it!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime? The movie opens with shots from the Spanish Civil War, and a line of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France after defeat by the Francoists. Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard. Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother. Like all Republican sympathizers, she is contemptuous and deeply suspicious of all Catholic clergy, who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime, both during and after the war. In return for information about the layout of the hospital and surrounding area, Paco tells Artiguez to \\"bump into Viñolas\\" for him.

Based on the given review \\"Open source,\\" it is challenging to provide a rating on a scale of 1-5, as there is minimal information and context. However, let's try to analyze the given review based on the available information. 1. Length: The review consists only of two words, \\"Open source.\\" It is quite short and does not give any additional information beyond mentioning that the subject is open source. 2. Depth of analysis: Due to its brevity, there's no explicit analysis of the subject, be it a product, service, or idea. The review lacks any elaboration on the pros, cons, or features of the subject being discussed. It also doesn't mention the reviewer's personal experience or opinion. 3. Relevance: The review seems to mention the open-source nature of the subject, which, in some cases, can be a significant factor when evaluating it. Open source usually implies that the source code is accessible to the public and can be freely used, modified, and redistributed. For some people, this can be viewed as a positive attribute, while others may not find it importantly crucial or to have any significant bearing on their evaluation. 4. Overall quality: With only two words, the review does not provide enough information for someone to make a decision or form an opinion on the subject. The lack of context and details make it impossible to discern whether the reviewer considers the open-source nature as a positive or a negative factor. Given all these factors, it seems fair to give this review a rating of 1 (least favorable) on a scale of 1-5. This rating is mainly because the review is too short to provide any valuable insight or assistance to someone looking for feedback on the subject. A more comprehensive review that includes context, in-depth analysis, and personal opinions would allow for a higher rating on the scale."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alexander asks why he doesn't go off to Heaven. Oscar replies that he doesn't want to leave those he lived with. The children's mother remarries in less than a year, going to a strict Bishop Edvard Vergerus' (Jan Malmsjö) house with none of her furniture, none of the children's toys, and an optimism that she can make a good thing of it despite his powerfully controlling personality. Alexander learns from the ghost of the Bishop's first wife that she and her children died trying to escape after having been locked up for days. They climbed out a window but failed to make it across the cold fast-flowing stream that separates the back of the house from the town. Alexander tells this to a servant who repeats it to the Bishop. The Bishop must discredit this story, and demands retraction.

At the orphanage, the girl, like all the children there, was taught to read and write. While she was studying at the orphanage, she learned something else-to be independent . At twenty-one, she left the orphanage and began to work as a secretary. And then, in 1975, while she was still working as an ordinary secretary, something special happened. She entered the Miss Hong Kong Competition and won it. This was the turning point in her life. Now her name, Mary Cheung, was known to everybody. Mary entered the competition because she wanted to show that orphanage girls could be something. Winning the competition gave her the chance to start a new life. This led her first into television and then into business as a manager. When she was working as a manager, she had trouble with her reports. \\"My English just wasn't good enough.\\" she says. Luckily, she had a boyfriend (who later became her husband) to help her. Mary studied management at Hong Kong Polytechnic and graduated in 1980. She started her own business in 1985.

I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her. My trousers were torn, and my ankles, legs, and hands were bleeding. I told her that I would not be back, and left. Later that night, her husband called to apologize on her behalf.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Cary Grant (born Archibald Alec Leach; January 18, 1904 - November 29, 1986) was an English-American actor, known as one of classic Hollywood's definitive leading men. He began a career in Hollywood in the early 1930s, and became known for his transatlantic accent, debonair demeanor, and light-hearted approach to acting and sense of comic timing. He became an American citizen in 1942. Born in Horfield, Bristol, Grant became attracted to theatre at a young age, and began performing with a troupe known as \\"The Penders\\" from the age of six. Biographers Morecambe and Stirling believe that Cary Grant was the \\"greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known\\". Schickel stated that there are \\"very few stars who achieve the magnitude of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order\\", and thought that he was the \\"best star actor there ever was in the movies\\". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor in the history of the cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him \\"the only actor I ever loved in my whole life\\", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: \\"To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment\\". Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately, because he \\"embodies what seems a happier time-a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer.\\" Grant was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Penny Serenade (1941) and None But the Lonely Heart (1944), but never won a competitive Oscar; he received a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970. The inscription on his statuette read \\"To Cary Grant, for his unique mastery of the art of screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues\\". On being presented with the award, his friend Frank Sinatra announced: \\"It was made for the sheer brilliance of acting ... No one has brought more pleasure to more people for so many years than Cary has, and nobody has done so many things so well\\". At the Straw Hat Awards in New York in May 1975, Grant was awarded a special plaque which recognized the city's appreciation of him as a \\"star and superstar in entertainment\\". The following August, he was invited by Betty Ford to give a speech at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City and to attend the Bicentenary dinner for Queen Elizabeth II at the White House that same year. He was later invited in 1978 to attend a royal charity gala at the London Palladium. In 1979, Grant hosted the American Film Institute's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, and presented Laurence Olivier with his honorary Oscar. In 1981, Grant was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors. Three years later, a theatre on the MGM lot was renamed the \\"Cary Grant Theatre\\". In 1995, when over a hundred leading film directors were asked to reveal their favorite actor of all time in a Time Out poll, Grant came second only to Marlon Brando. On December 7, 2001, a statue of Grant was unveiled in Millennium Square, a regenerated area next to Bristol Harbour, Bristol, in the city where he was born. In November 2005, Grant again came first in Premiere magazine's list of \\"The 50 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time\\".

Duran Duran was formed in Birmingham, England, in 1978 by keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor. The band's classic lineup also included lead vocalist Simon Le Bon, guitarist Andy Taylor, and drummer Roger Taylor. They were at the forefront of the new wave music movement in the early 1980s and achieved significant commercial success in both the UK and the United States. \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" is a song from their second studio album, \\"Rio,\\" released in May 1982. The song was written by the band members and produced by Colin Thurston. The track features catchy melodies, a memorable chorus, and an upbeat tempo that contributed to its popularity and longevity. The song is also known for its exotic, sensual, and mysterious lyrics, which Simon Le Bon has said was inspired by the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood. The music video for \\"Hungry Like the Wolf,\\" directed by Russell Mulcahy, played a significant role in the song's success. The video featured scenes of the band members in a jungle setting, pursuing a beautiful woman while being hunted down themselves. Shot in Sri Lanka, the video showcased the band's flamboyant fashion sense and on-screen charisma. The video was heavily played on MTV in the United States, which helped Duran Duran gain considerable exposure and break into the American market. Upon its release, \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" received critical acclaim and quickly climbed the UK singles chart, peaking at no. 5. It also reached no. 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1983. The song has since become one of Duran Duran's most iconic hits and is considered a quintessential new wave track from the 1980s. Over the years, it has found its place in various \\"best of\\" lists and countdowns, including being ranked no. 25 in VH1's \\"100 Greatest Songs of the '80s.\\" Additionally, the \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" music video won a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video in 1984. Duran Duran's success with \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" and the \\"Rio\\" album helped establish them as one of the most popular bands of the 1980s.

How is \\"Regarding the latter, Ban said a sustainable solution remains elusive.\\" said in Romanian?","completion":"In Romanian, \\"Regarding the latter, Ban said a sustainable solution remains elusive.\\" is translated as \\"Referitor la acesta din urmă, Ban a declarat că o soluție durabilă rămâne greu de găsit.\\" Let's breakdown this translation for a better understanding: - \\"Regarding\\" translates to \\"Referitor la\\". In Romanian, \\"Regarding\\" refers to something that has already been mentioned before and it is usually followed by the preposition \\"la\\". - \\"The latter\\" translates to \\"acesta din urmă\\", which refers to the last of a mentioned series. In Romanian, it is not uncommon for the verb to be closer to the end of the sentence, thus changing the order of some phrases. Hence, \\"The latter\\" is translated after \\"Regarding\\". - \\"Ban\\" remains the same as it's a proper noun. Note, Semantically, \\"Ban\\" could refer to an individual's name, or an organization such as the United Nations Ban Ki-moon. - \\"Said a\\" can be translated to \\"a declarat că\\". While \\"said\\" directly translates to \\"a spus\\", in this context, the statement seems to be formal so using \\"a declarat că\\" (declared that) is more appropriate in Romanian. - \\"Sustainable\\" translates to \\"durabilă\\". \\"Sustainable\\" is an adjective and in Romanian it agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies. In this case, it modifies \\"soluție\\" which is feminine singular, so we use \\"durabilă\\". - \\"Solution\\" translates to \\"soluție\\". This noun remains relatively the same in both languages, but remember Romanian nouns have genders and \\"soluție\\" is feminine, which influenced our earlier translation of \\"sustainable\\". - \\"Remains elusive\\" translates to \\"rămâne greu de găsit\\". The verb \\"remains\\" could directly translate to \\"rămâne\\", while the adjective \\"elusive\\" is not directly translated but replaced by the phrase \\"greu de găsit\\" that suggests something is \\"hard to find\\". This is done to preserve the overall meaning of the sentence, as an elusive solution is one that is difficult to obtain or find. So, in a romanian sentence constructions, the above translations is \\"Referitor la acesta din urmă, Ban a declarat că o soluție durabilă rămâne greu de găsit.\\""},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Two brothers Syd and Dan went to college. Syd studied plate tectonics and mantle melting. His brother Dan got to study types of soil and pedology. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which brother studied more about rising temperatures influencing mantle melting? Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

Taylor was also a jazz educator, who lectured in colleges, served on panels and travelled worldwide as a jazz ambassador. In 1952 Taylor composed one of his most famous tunes, \\"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\\", which achieved more popularity with the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Nina Simone covered the song in her 1967 album Silk & Soul. The tune is widely known in the UK as a piano instrumental version, used for BBC Television's long-running Film... programme. He made dozens of recordings in the 1950s and 1960s, notably the album with Cuban percussionist Candido Camero, entitled Billy Taylor Trio with Candido, My Fair Lady Loves Jazz, Cross Section and Taylor Made Jazz. Taylor's broadcast career also thrived. In 1961, he founded New York's Jazzmobile, which provides an arts education program via workshops, master classes, lecture demonstrations, arts enrichment programs, outdoor summer mobile concerts, special indoor concerts and special projects. In 1958, he became the Musical Director of NBC's The Subject Is Jazz, the first ever television series focusing on jazz. The 13-part series was produced by the new National Educational Television Network (NET) and hosted guests including Ellington, Aaron Copland, Bill Evans, Cannonball Adderley, Jimmy Rushing and Langston Hughes. Taylor also worked as a DJ and program director on radio station WLIB in New York in the 1960s. During the 1960s, the Billy Taylor Trio was a regular feature of the Hickory House on West 55th Street in Manhattan. From 1969 to 1972, he served as the music director for The David Frost Show and was the first African American to lead a talk-show band. Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Benny Goodman and Buddy Rich were just a few of the musicians who played on the show. In 1981, Jazzmobile produced a jazz special for National Public Radio, for which the program received the Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting Programs. Jazzmobile's 1990 Tribute Concert to Dr. Taylor at Avery Fisher Hall, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, featured Nancy Wilson, Ahmad Jamal Trio and Terence Blanchard Quintet. What was he up to during his mid career?","completion":"During his mid-career, Billy Taylor was very active in the jazz world. He was making lots of recordings during the 1950s and 1960s, like the album with Cuban percussionist Candido Camero and albums called My Fair Lady Loves Jazz, Cross Section, and Taylor Made Jazz. He was also on television as the Musical Director of the show \\"The Subject Is Jazz,\\" which was the first TV series about jazz. Besides that, he worked as a DJ and program director on a radio station called WLIB in New York in the 1960s. He played regularly with his Billy Taylor Trio at the Hickory House, a famous place in Manhattan, New York. Overall, he was very busy making music, teaching people about jazz, and sharing his love for jazz with everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: The multiple churches that form the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement have different views on Marian doctrines and venerative practices given that there is no single church with universal authority within the Communion and that the mother church (the Church of England) understands itself to be both \\"catholic\\" and \\"Reformed\\". Thus unlike the Protestant churches at large, the Anglican Communion (which includes the Episcopal Church in the United States) includes segments which still retain some veneration of Mary. What is the answer to this question: What branch of Christianity does the Angican Communion fall under?","completion":"The Anglican Communion falls under the Anglican branch of Christianity. Originating in the Church of England, the Anglican Communion is a worldwide family of autonomous churches that maintain a shared heritage and common ties in theological, liturgical, and ecclesiological practices. Anglicanism came into existence following the English Reformation in the 16th century when King Henry VIII separated the English Church from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. This split resulted in the formation of a distinct theological and liturgical identity that has continued to evolve over the centuries. While maintaining many aspects of Roman Catholicism, the Anglican Communion also incorporates elements of Protestantism and emphasizes the authority of scripture, reason, and tradition in the development of its beliefs and practices. Overall, the Anglican Communion stands as a unique and diverse branch of Christianity, situated on the spectrum between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. This positioning is due in part to the Church of England's self-understanding as both \\"catholic\\" and \\"Reformed,\\" as mentioned in the article. This dual nature allows for a wide range of views within the Anglican Communion on various doctrines and practices, including the veneration of Mary. While certain segments of the Anglican Communion still uphold Marian doctrines and practices that align with Roman Catholic traditions, other segments lean more towards Protestant understandings of Mary's role in the Christian faith. In summary, the Anglican Communion is a distinct branch of Christianity that encompasses a diverse range of beliefs and practices, rooted in both \\"catholic\\" and \\"Reformed\\" traditions. This theological diversity is reflected in the varying views on Marian doctrines and venerative practices within the Anglican Communion and the Continuing Anglican movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Madoff said he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s.\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"Bernie Madoff was selling a fraudulent investment scheme known as a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud that relies on the constant inflow of new investors' money to pay returns to earlier investors. This creates the illusion of a legitimate and profitable business when, in reality, there is no actual profit being generated. Madoff claimed to be using a proprietary trading strategy called \\"split-strike conversion\\" to generate consistent high returns for his clients. He attracted thousands of investors, promising them steady returns with low risk. However, instead of investing the money properly, Madoff used the new investments to pay out returns to previous investors, essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul. Your statement, \\"Madoff said he began the Ponzi scheme in the early 1990s,\\" would be a reasonable answer to when his fraudulent activities started. Bernie Madoff confessed in 2008 that he had been running the Ponzi scheme since the early 1990s, although some evidence suggests that it may have begun even earlier. Ultimately, Madoff's scheme collapsed under the weight of mounting redemptions requests during the 2008 financial crisis. Madoff confessed to his sons, who then alerted authorities to his massive fraud. In 2009, he was convicted and sentenced to 150 years in prison. The Madoff Ponzi scheme was the largest financial fraud in U.S. history, resulting in an estimated 64.8 billion in paper wealth being wiped out and an estimated 17.5 billion in actual losses for investors."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Monster Movie plot: The film takes place in Tokyo in 2003, where two reporters - Sarah Sullivan (Sarah Lieving) and Erin Lynch (Erin Sullivan) - have arrived from the United States to document unusual seismic disturbances that have been picked up around Tokyo. The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage(possibly referencing the real-life Fukuoka earthquake or the Miyagi earthquake), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise. As time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005, but the tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries, but has since been awakened by mankind, and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground, with the filmmakers documenting the catastrophe as it unfolds.It starts as Sarah and Erin are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Sarah's car as the two drive to LAX, to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Erin films Sarah talking with the global warming minister. During the interview, an earthquake strikes and the scene again switches to the reporters in the basement of the environmental building trying to find someone who can speak English. Eventually, they find Justin - a worker - who is from America as well. He says that they have to go to the American embassy, and, as they flee, they hear the sounds of panic and plane engines from a tunnel.Later, they find a mall, and another earthquake occurs.

This project, led by Royal Skousen, utilized the gathered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and applied advanced photographic techniques to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments. The original manuscript of the Book of Mormon was written by various scribes as Joseph Smith dictated his translation. Over time, parts of the manuscript experienced damage or were lost due to various factors such as exposure to the elements and improper storage. The remaining fragments, some of which are in private hands or held by institutions, have been vital in enabling this project to restore the text of the Book of Mormon. The availability of these fragments has enabled researchers to understand better the textual changes that may have occurred through copying, editing, and printing processes. The project's use of advanced photographic techniques allows for a greater understanding of the text, even when the physical condition of the manuscript fragments is not optimal. These techniques include ultraviolet photography, which can reveal text that is invisible to the naked eye due to ink deterioration or other factors. By applying these techniques, researchers can glean valuable information from the fragments and establish a clearer understanding of the text's wording, spelling, and punctuation. In conclusion, the Critical Text of the Book of Mormon Project utilized the gathered fragments of the Original Manuscript of the Book of Mormon and employed advanced photographic techniques to obtain fine readings from otherwise unreadable pages and fragments. This project is crucial in establishing a more accurate representation of the original English text of the Book of Mormon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Most bacterial species are either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation is associated with swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface area to volume ratio of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety of shapes is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.

The trial of Anders Behring Breivik was interrupted briefly Friday when the brother one of his 77 victims hurled a shoe at the confessed mass killer and yelled, \\"Go to hell,\\" before being escorted from the court room, police and witnesses said. Anders Behring Breivik, who has admitted to the July 22, 2011 massacre and a bombing in Oslo that killed eight people earlier that day, stands with a police woman in court in Oslo Thursday May 10, 2012.... (Associated Press) It was the first outburst from the normally subdued crowd watching the terror trial in Oslo's district court since the proceedings began in mid-April. Breivik _ a self-styled, anti-Muslim militant _ has been charged with terrorism, admitting he carried out a bomb-and-shooting rampage that stunned Norway on July 22. On Friday, forensic experts were going through autopsy reports for some of the 69 victims killed in the shooting massacre at a youth camp that day, when a man in the second row suddenly stood up, said Mikaela Akerman, a Swedish journalist who was in the court room. \\"He threw one of his shoes at the desk where Breivik sits with his defense lawyers,\\" Akerman told The Associated Press. He shouted, 'You killer, go to hell.' And repeated it several times.\\" She said Breivik remained calm and \\"smiled a little\\" as he watched security guards apprehend the man and lead him out of the court room. \\"He keeps shouting and is crying heavily as he's being led out,\\" Akerman said. \\"Some of the spectators clapped their hands. Some yelled 'Bravo.' Many others started crying.\\" Breivik addressed the court as proceedings resumed after a 10-minute break. \\"If someone wants to throw something at me, you can do it when I walk in or when I leave, thank you,\\" he said, according to Akerman. Throwing of shoes to insult someone has long been a form of protest in many countries, but the practice gained widespread attention when an Iraqi threw his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush at a televised news conference in Baghdad in 2008 during the Iraq war. Police didn't identify the shoe-thrower in Oslo but said he was the brother of one of the victims. Police operations leader Rune Bjoersvik downplayed the outburst, calling it a \\"spontaneous and emotional reaction\\" that didn't pose a \\"serious security risk.\\" The incident was a sharp break with the polite atmosphere that has reigned inside the court room, even as Breivik explained his killing of 77 people in a bomb-and-shooting rampage on July 22. The far-right fanatic has admitted to the attacks but pleaded innocent to terror charges, saying the victims were traitors for embracing multiculturalism. ___ Associated Press writer Karl Ritter in Stockholm contributed to this report. ||||| A police officer looks at far right mass killer Anders Behring Breivik (R) in court in Oslo May 10, 2012. OSLO (Reuters) - The brother of a man gunned down by Anders Behring Breivik hurled a shoe at the mass killer in court on Friday, shouting \\"Go to hell, go to hell, you killed my brother.\\" The outburst followed days of harrowing testimony from survivors of Norway's worst peacetime massacre. The shoe missed Breivik but struck his co-defense lawyer, Vibeke Hein Baera, who was seated closest to the public gallery, during the presentation of an autopsy report. Police said the attacker, who was quickly escorted from the court, was a brother of one of the 69 people Breivik methodically shot dead on the small island of Utoeya last July during a youth camp organized by the ruling Labour Party. Breivik admits the killings but denies criminal responsibility, saying he was defending Norwegian ethnic purity from Muslim immigration and the multiculturalism policies of the governing Labour Party. The Aftenposten newspaper named the man who threw the shoe as Hayder Mustafa Qasim, an Iraqi whose asylum seeker brother was killed on the island by Breivik. \\"I took off my shoe, stood up, shouted at the killer, got eye contact with him and threw the shoe,\\" Qasim told Aftenposten. \\"Go to hell killer! I shouted. He looked right into my eyes. I felt that he had understood my message.\\" \\"My brother was killed on Utoeya. He was alone in Norway, without family. The killer took his life. And he ruined my life and my family's life.\\" The incident evoked the gesture by an Iraqi reporter who hurled his shoes at former U.S. President George W. Bush in 2008. Hitting someone with a shoe is considered particularly insulting in the Middle East because footwear is regarded as unclean. Some in the courtroom applauded Qasim's gesture, some said \\"finally\\" and others started to cry. Police, removed him from the court and increased their presence to avoid further interruptions of the trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks. Local media quoted Breivik, 33, as saying after the incident: \\"If anyone wants to throw something, you can throw it at me when I'm entering or leaving the court. \\"Don't throw things at my lawyers.\\" Friday's outburst was the first interruption of proceedings. Many observers have been surprised by the cool Nordic civility on display in the courtroom despite a killing spree which traumatized this nation of five million. GRIEF Friday's incident came at the end of a week of harrowing testimony from survivors of Breivik's killing spree. As well as those shot dead, eight others died in a massive car bomb Breivik detonated outside the prime minister's offices in central Oslo. Police played down the shoe throwing incident. \\"We regard this as a spontaneous emotional outburst,\\" Rune Bjoersvik, the police officer charge of police operations in the court, told Reuters. \\"We wish it hadn't happened, but we don't regard this a dramatic breach of safety.\\" Throughout his trial Breivik has listened calmly to the descriptions of his killings and shown little emotion, except when hearing descriptions about how he was said to have let out \\"cries of joy\\" and laughed while shooting, which he has denied. During Friday's hearing Breivik said one person at Utoeya had thrown an object at his face as he went about the small island shooting his victims. But he gave no more details. Breivik has said he should either be executed or acquitted, calling the prospect of a prison sentence \\"pathetic\\" and an insanity ruling \\"worse than death\\". Ahead of his trial, court-appointed psychiatrists concluded he was psychotic but a second team came to the opposite conclusion. If deemed sane, Breivik faces a 21-year jail sentence with indefinite extensions for as long as he is considered dangerous.

The controversial Channel 4 show prompted a furore in January from viewers who claimed it was 'poverty porn' which misrepresented benefit claimants across Britain. But broadcasting watchdog Ofcom ruled the show about James Turner Street, Birmingham, was clearly a portrayal of one street and not wider society. Scroll down for video. Furore: The Channel 4 show Benefits Street, which included controversial welfare claimant 'White' Dee Kelly (pictured), has been cleared of breaching Ofcom's guidelines despite sparking more than 900 complaints. The watchdog admitted parts of the show would offend some viewers but said: 'The beginning of every episode in the. series included an introduction in which the narrator stated: \\"James. Turner Street in Birmingham is not your average street…and most of the. residents are claiming benefits.\\" 'The aim of the series was therefore. presented as being a record of the daily lives of some of the residents. of this particular road to inform viewers about their lives and their. community. 'Ofcom’s view was that it would have been clear to viewers,. over the course of the series, that this was an observational. documentary about the experiences of one community. 'Therefore, after careful consideration, we. concluded that overall Channel 4 ensured there was sufficient context. over the course of the series to justify the offence and that it applied. generally accepted standards.' The series was a ratings hit for. Channel 4 but drew criticism for allegedly demonising those living on. the breadline. It caused a stir when it was screened. and prompted discussion in Parliament as well as public meetings in the. area where some of those featured claimed they were misrepresented. Ruling: Ofcom said the portrayal of James Turner Street (pictured) was not meant to reflect all of Britain. The vast majority of complaints - 887 - were about the way. those on benefits were portrayed. Some 23 viewers also raised fears about. children and young people featured in the show and the care which was. given by programme makers for their welfare and dignity. Ofcom also ruled in Channel 4's favour on these complaints, none of which were from those featured in the show, saying: 'After a thorough assessment of the evidence,. Ofcom found sufficient steps were taken before, during and after. production to protect the welfare of the children that appeared in the. programme and that any potentially offensive material was justified by. the context in which it was presented. 'Ofcom has therefore concluded. that the series did not breach its rules.' There. were also 40 complaints about the programmes demonstrating criminal. techniques, including shoplifting. But Ofcom said it was. satisfied that there was an editorial justification for their inclusion. and there were not enough details for people to copy the techniques. Controversy: James Turner Street in Birmingham became the subject of a national debate in January. A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'We welcome Ofcom's finding that Benefits Street did not breach the code in any respect. 'We are proud that our robust duty of care protocols for the child contributors have been praised for \\"demonstrating best practice\\", and for the recognition that we 'ensured the interests of the under-18s who featured in Benefits Street were protected and that due care was applied before, during and after production. 'Ofcom noted that the series \\"illustrated important issues facing some children living in contemporary Britain\\" and that \\"the children's welfare was at the heart of the production\\".'

Here is a news article: The fourth debate of the 2012 Republican presidential race is in the books! After live-blogging the proceedings, we turn to our favorite part of any debate night: looking at who won and who lost. Our take is below. Agree or disagree with our picks? Leave a question or comment for today’s Fix Face-off video Q&A, or in the comments section below. WINNERS * Mitt Romney: Four debates. Four times Romney has wound up in the winner’s circle. It’s not a coincidence. Romney proved yet again that he is the best debater in this field with another solid performance in which he effectively downplayed his liabilities on health care and accentuated his strengths on jobs and the economy. Romney played more offense than he has in previous debates, taking the fight to Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Social Security. He also got a major assist from Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) and former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.), both of whom relentlessly bashed Perry. But that’s how debates work. Romney also, smartly, ignored the tea party audience in the hall — who occasionally booed him — and focused his messaging on the much broader audience of people watching the debate on CNN. * Newt Gingrich: The former House Speaker was at his populist best tonight, repeatedly delivering one-liners that had the crowd on his side. This was the Gingrich that many Republican strategists predicted would be a major player in the GOP race when 2011 began. Unfortunately for Gingrich, he lacks the sort of campaign organization in early states that would allow him to capi­tal­ize on what was clearly a good night for him. * Michele Bachmann: The Minnesota Congresswoman did a lot with not all that much time. Picking a fight with Perry on the HPV vaccination issue was smart and seemed to energize her for the final 30 minutes or so of the debate. There was no game-changer for Bachmann in this debate but she was far more relevant to the conversation than her no-show last week in California. Small victories. * The Santorum-Gingrich Alliance: Who says there is no love lost between these Republican contenders? Time after time Gingrich and Santorum praised one another for their work on issues — cementing a sort of alliance that makes for an interesting (if minor) storyline going forward. Could Santorum and Gingrich be the next great tag team of the 2012 Republican race? Which bring us to.... * Professional wrestling fans: The opening of the CNN debate felt exactly like the beginning of a pay-per-view wrestling match. (Not that we would spend our hard-earned money on such things. Ahem.) From the descriptions of the candidates — “The Businessman”....”The Libertarian” — to Wolf Blitzer giving each candidate their own introduction onto the stage, it felt like a theatrical production. Which, of course, it was. LOSERS * Rick Perry: The frontrunner didn’t get it done tonight. After surviving the expected back and forth with Romney over Social Security, Perry seemed to let his guard down a bit when the subject turned to his executive order on the HPV vaccine. Big mistake. Bachmann lit into him and Santorum jumped on too. (Romney said nothing but had to be thrilled with the development.) Perry tried to emphasize that he was acting to save lives but it didn’t sell. Following that exchange, he looked flustered and missed a chance to go after Romney in a more meaningful way on health care. And Perry’s answer on illegal immigration drew boos from the audience. Looking for a silver lining for Perry? He demonstrated a willingness to clean up self-created messes on both Social Security and his “treasonous” remark about Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. * Jon Huntsman: The former Utah governor started with a Kurt Cobain joke....and went downhill from there. After a very solid performance in California last week, Huntsman regressed badly — bouncing between bad one-liners and outright snark. At times he seemed to disappear from the debate completely and when he did get a chance to speak, Huntsman seemed more interested in winning a laugh from the audience than making a point. Not good. * Ron Paul: We wrote earlier today that the tea party debate might be a moment for Dr. Paul. Or not. Paul often felt like an afterthought and when the conversation turned to foreign policy Paul got lustily booed by the crowd — and attacked by Santorum — for his views on the post-September 11 landscape. Paul’s answer — and his refusal to back down — made clear that he simply isn’t within the mainstream of Republican thought on the issue, making any growth beyond his base very difficult. * 90-minute debate fans: Is two hours the new normal for debates? The Fix is no spring chicken and these long debates are robbing us of our precious beauty sleep. More on PostPolitics Perry, Romney clash on Social Security Romney uses Boeing issue to appeal to tea party Florida GOP debate Perry, Romney spar on Social Security ||||| TAMPA, Fla. — This did not feel like your father’s presidential debate. A triumph for a movement born just over two years ago, the first-ever tea party presidential debate was a clear departure from the four previous ones this cycle — or before. Text Size - + reset POLITICO 44 Inside a dusty warehouse on a fairground, instead of a marbled presidential library, the crowd was rabidly partisan, bursting with boisterous applause that served as a live dial meter for the candidates to measure — and adjust to — in real time. Afterward, instead of whisking away in their black SUVs, most of the contenders headed across the street for a mix and mingle afterparty with those who served up the questions. The crowd is, after all, expecting to be in charge from here on out. “We are going to choose the next Republican nominee for president, not the Republican Party,” said Amy Kremer, chair of the Tea Party Express, which partnered with CNN for the two-hour event to the audience just minutes before the eight GOP contenders took the stage. The substance wasn’t all that different as the candidates were pelted with questions from tea party activists around the country and via satellite in addition to CNN moderator Wolf Blitzer: Aside from the Federal Reserve and the Fair Tax, Monday covered typical issues like immigration, health care and job creation. But unlike in other debate settings where the crowds refrain from jolting reactions, this gathering was humming with emotion, releasing almost instantaneous bursts of audible approval or dissatisfaction. The real message being delivered was a shot across the bow: Any contender who wants a realistic shot at winning back the White House will need the tea party’s fervor to make it happen. “I definitely think the energy and enthusiasm in this debate from the people in the audience, there was way more of it,” said Kremer in an interview after. “They should feel it. What we have is the passion, the fire in the belly. That’s organic. It can’t be bought and can’t be created.” The process wasn’t always pretty. Ron Paul was booed when he tried to explain what he sees as America’s role in the root causes of the Sept. 11 attacks. So was Rick Perry — for his defense of a Texas law that gave in-state college tuition to children of illegal immigrants. Jon Huntsman got perhaps the coldest reception. Several times the former Utah governor attempted to charm over an unnatural constituency with humor. But he barely earned a golf clap, and by the conclusion, the look of bewilderment on his face marked a man who looked like he’d seen a ghost. The intensity even sparked a darker moment — custom-made for Democrats to use down the road— when audience members shouted “Yeah!” in response to a question from Blitzer about whether a 30-year-old man without health insurance should be left to die. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The 2012 Republican presidential race held its fourth debate, garnering significant attention and discussion. Among the winners of the debate were Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, and Michele Bachmann. Romney proved his debating prowess, skillfully downplaying his liabilities on health care and emphasizing his strengths in job creation and the economy.

On the other hand, Rick Perry failed to impress and looked flustered when challenged on the HPV vaccine by Bachmann and former senator Rick Santorum. Jon Huntsman struggled with humor and snark, often disappearing from the debate and delivering a weak performance. Ron Paul was criticized for his views on the post-September 11 landscape and failed to win the support of Tea Party debate fans.

For years, he played against able-bodied players by putting rubber on the stumps of his legs. Though he was a foot (30.48cm) or two shorter than many of the players he played against, he won a number of matches. He became well-known enough that he got to meet Rafael Nadal, his favorite player at the US Open in 2013. \\"The most important thing is that he's happy,\\" Nadal told reports about Stroud after that 15-minute meeting. \\"He's playing tennis... That's a great example of being happy even if life doesn't give you everything.\\" Stroud started playing wheelchair tennis at 13 and now he is No 1 in the US. Earlier this summer, he played for the US in the world's biggest junior wheelchair team tennis event --- the World Team Cup. He played six matches and won five of them as the US won the cup for the first time since 2000. \\"He is a polite boy , but he will rip your heart out trying to beat you,\\" Jason Harnett, a United States Tennis Association coach, said of Stroud. \\"You see that attitude in a lot of the best players, whether they are able-bodied or disabled. Teenage players can often get disappointed and angry. Racquets sometimes get thrown. Players shout at themselves after missed shots. Stroud never does that. \\" I just try to stay positive,\\" Stroud said. \\"After every point, I try to say I'm going to win the next point, or the next game, or the next game, or the whole match. \\" There's always room to be positive .

Pick from: a). Yes; b). It's impossible to say; c). No; Hypothesis: Lebanon is feeling joyous.","completion":"c). No; The hypothesis that \\"Lebanon is feeling joyous\\" is not true based on the paragraph provided. The paragraph explains that Lebanon is in a period of mourning following a devastating event; this strongly suggests a state of sadness and loss rather than joy. A massive car bomb resulted in the death of the former Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, which is a tragic event likely leading to grief and sorrow across the nation. The atmosphere during periods of mourning typically involves feelings of sorrow, loss, grief, anguish, and, at times, anger or confusion. It is a time when people collectively express their sadness and pay their respects to someone who has died. In this case, the person who has died is a former Prime Minister, a figure of national importance, implying that the mourning would be widespread across the country. Therefore, it is very unlikely that the mood in Lebanon would be characterized as joyous following such a tragic event, refuting the hypothesis. Mourning and joy are significantly contrasting emotional states, and it seems improbable that these sentiments would be experienced simultaneously in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information: - Chemotherapy (often abbreviated to chemo and sometimes CTX or CTx) is a category of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of medical oncology (the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer). - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. - Menopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time in most women's lives when menstrual periods stop permanently, and they are no longer able to bear children. Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Medical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any vaginal bleeding for a year. It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries. In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but they still have ovaries, menopause may be viewed to have occurred at the time of the surgery or when their hormone levels fell. Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms typically occur earlier, at an average of 45 years of age. Before menopause, a woman's periods typically become irregular, which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow. During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, sweating, and reddening of the skin. Hot flashes often stop occurring after a year or two. Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and mood changes. The severity of symptoms varies between women. While menopause is often thought to be linked to an increase in heart disease, this primarily occurs due to increasing age and does not have a direct relationship with menopause. In some women, problems that were present like endometriosis or painful periods will improve after menopause. Menopause is usually a natural change. It can occur earlier in those who smoke tobacco. Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries or some types of chemotherapy. At the physiological level, menopause happens because of a decrease in the ovaries' production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. While typically not needed, a diagnosis of menopause can be confirmed by measuring hormone levels in the blood or urine. Menopause is the opposite of menarche, the time when a girl's periods... - Radiation therapy or radiotherapy, often abbreviated RT, RTx, or XRT, is therapy using ionizing radiation, generally as part of cancer treatment to control or kill malignant cells and normally delivered by a linear accelerator. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers. The subspecialty of oncology concerned with radiotherapy is called radiation oncology. - Lobular carcinoma is a form of tumor which primarily affects the lobules of a gland. - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. - Bone pain (also known medically by several other names) is pain coming from a bone. It occurs as a result of a wide range of diseases and/or physical conditions and may severely impair the quality of life for patients who suffer from it. Bone pain belongs to the class of deep somatic pain, often experienced as a dull pain that cannot be localized accurately by the patient. This is in contrast with the pain which is mediated by superficial receptors in, e.g., the skin. Bone pain can have several possible causes ranging from extensive physical stress to serious diseases such as cancer. For many years it has been known that bones are innervated with sensory neurons. Yet their exact anatomy remained obscure due to the contrasting physical properties of bone and neural tissue. More recently, it is becoming clear what types of nerves innervated which sections of bone. The periosteal layer of bone tissue is highly pain-sensitive and an important cause of pain in several disease conditions causing bone pain, like fractures, osteoarthritis, etc. However, in certain diseases the endosteal and haversian nerve supply seems to play an important role, e.g. in osteomalacia, osteonecrosis, and other bone diseases. Thus there are several types of bone pain, each with many potential sources or origins of cause. - The breast is one of two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso of female primates. In females, it serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk and feeds infants. Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. At puberty, estrogens, in conjunction with growth hormone, cause breast development. Males do not develop pronounced or physiologically matured breasts because their bodies produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing breast tissue. The breasts of females are typically far more prominent than those of males. - Raloxifene (marketed as Evista by Eli Lilly and Company) is an oral selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has estrogenic actions on bone and anti-estrogenic actions on the uterus and breast. It is used in the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and in postmenopausal women at high risk for invasive breast cancer. - Canadian football is a form of gridiron football played in Canada in which two teams of 12 players each compete for territorial control of a field of play long and wide attempting to advance a pointed prolate spheroid ball into the opposing team's scoring area (end zone). - The Atlanta Falcons are a professional American football team based in Atlanta, Georgia. The Falcons compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The Falcons joined the NFL in 1965 as an expansion team, after the NFL offered then-owner Rankin Smith a franchise to keep him from joining the rival American Football League (AFL). The AFL instead granted a franchise to Miami (the Miami Dolphins). The Falcons are tied with the Dolphins (who also began play in 1966) for being the second-oldest NFL franchise in the Deep South, and are the second-oldest NFC team in that region, after the Dallas Cowboys. - A quarterback (commonly abbreviated to QB) is a position in American and Canadian football. Quarterbacks are members of the offensive team and line up directly behind the offensive line. In modern American football, the quarterback is usually considered the leader of the offensive team, and is often responsible for calling the play in the huddle. - Breast-conserving surgery (BCS, also known as breast conservation surgery and segmental mastectomy) is a less radical cancer surgery than mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery, as in a lumpectomy removes part of the breast tissue during surgery, as opposed to the entire breast. - In physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or through a material medium. This includes: - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). - Shortness of breath, also known as dyspnea, is a feeling like one cannot breathe well enough. The American Thoracic Society defines it as \\"a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity\\", and recommends evaluating dyspnea by assessing the intensity of the distinct sensations, the degree of distress involved, and its burden or impact on activities of daily living. Distinct sensations include effort/work, chest tightness, and air hunger (the feeling of not enough oxygen). - The National Football League (NFL) is a professional American football league consisting of 32 teams, divided equally between the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC). The NFL is one of the four major professional sports leagues in North America, and the highest professional level of American football in the world. The NFL's 17-week regular season runs from the week after Labor Day to the week after Christmas, with each team playing 16 games and having one bye week. Following the conclusion of the regular season, six teams from each conference (four division winners and two wild card teams) advance to the playoffs, a single-elimination tournament culminating in the Super Bowl, played between the champions of the NFC and AFC. - Deanna Tynes Favre ( born December 28 , 1968 in Kiln , Mississippi ) is an American activist and the wife of NFL quarterback Brett Favre . She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 , and later became an activist in the fight against the disease . She founded the Deanna Favre Hope Foundation to raise money and awareness for women around the country . - A biopsy is a medical test commonly performed by a surgeon, interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist involving extraction of sample cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist, and can also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy. When only a sample of tissue is removed with preservation of the histological architecture of the tissues cells, the procedure is called an incisional biopsy or core biopsy. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle in such a way that cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous and inflammatory conditions. - Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is any form of hormone therapy wherein the patient, in the course of medical treatment, receives hormones, either to supplement a lack of naturally occurring hormones or to substitute other hormones for naturally occurring hormones. Common forms of hormone replacement therapy include: - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with... - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys. - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), also known as intraductal carcinoma, is a pre-cancerous or non-invasive cancerous lesion of the breast. DCIS is classified as Stage 0. It rarely produces symptoms or a breast lump one can feel, and is usually detected through screening mammography. In DCIS, abnormal cells are found in the lining of one or more milk ducts in the breast. \\"In situ\\" means \\"in place\\" and refers to the fact that the abnormal cells have not moved out of the mammary duct and into any of the surrounding tissues in the breast (\\"pre-cancerous\\" refers to the fact that it has not yet become an invasive cancer). In some cases, DCIS may become invasive and spread to other tissues, but there is no way of determining which lesions will remain stable without treatment, and which will go on to become invasive. DCIS encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from low-grade lesions that are not life-threatening to high-grade (i.e. potentially highly aggressive) lesions. DCIS has been classified according to the architectural pattern of the cells (solid, cribriform, papillary, and micropapillary), tumor grade (high, intermediate, and low grade), and the presence or absence of comedo histology. DCIS can be detected on mammograms by examining tiny specks of calcium known as microcalcifications. Since suspicious groups of microcalcifications can appear even in the absence of DCIS, a biopsy may be necessary for diagnosis. About 2030% of those who do not receive treatment develop breast cancer. It is the most common type of pre-cancer in women. There is some disagreement as to whether, for statistical purposes, it should be counted as a cancer: some include DCIS when calculating breast cancer statistics while others do not. - In sport, a huddle is an action of a team gathering together, usually in a tight circle, to strategize, motivate or celebrate. It is a popular strategy for keeping opponents insulated from sensitive information, and acts as a form of insulation when the level of noise in the venue is such that normal on-field communication is difficult. Commonly the leader of the huddle is the team captain and it is the captain who will try to inspire his fellow team members to achieve success. Similarly after an event a huddle may take place to congratulate one another for the teams success, or to commiserate a defeat. The term \\"huddle\\" can be used as a verb as in \\"huddling up\\". - The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) North division. They are also the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, organized and starting play in 1919. It is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States. Home games are played at Lambeau Field. - Surgery (from the \\"cheirourgik\\" (composed of , \\"hand\\", and , \\"work\\"), via , meaning \\"hand work\\") is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). - Targeted therapy or molecularly targeted therapy is one of the major modalities of medical treatment (pharmacotherapy) for cancer, others being hormonal therapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy. As a form of molecular medicine, targeted therapy blocks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific targeted molecules needed for carcinogenesis and tumor growth, rather than by simply interfering with all rapidly dividing cells (e.g. with traditional chemotherapy). Because most agents for targeted therapy are biopharmaceuticals, the term \\"biologic therapy\\" is sometimes synonymous with \\"targeted therapy\\" when used in the context of cancer therapy (and thus distinguished from chemotherapy, that is, cytotoxic therapy). However, the modalities can be combined; antibody-drug conjugates combine biologic and cytotoxic mechanisms into one targeted therapy. - Breast reconstruction is the rebuilding of a breast, usually in women. It involves using autologous tissue or prosthetic material to construct a natural-looking breast. Often this includes the reformation of a natural-looking areola and nipple. This procedure involves the use of implants or relocated flaps of the patient's own tissue. - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of... - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum. - Brett Lorenzo Favre (born October 10, 1969) is a former American football quarterback who spent the majority of his career with the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He was a 20-year veteran of the NFL, having played quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons (1991), Green Bay Packers (19922007), New York Jets (2008), and Minnesota Vikings (20092010). Favre was the first quarterback in NFL history to pass for 500 touchdowns, throw for over 70,000 yards, over 6,000 completions, and over 10,000 pass attempts. - American football, referred to as football in the United States and Canada, and also known as gridiron, is a sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end. The offense, the team with control of the oval-shaped football, attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball, while the team without control of the ball, the defense, aims to stop their advance and take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs, or plays, or else they turn over the football to the opposing team; if they succeed, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins. - The New York Jets are a professional American football team located in the New York metropolitan area. The Jets compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team is headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey. In a unique arrangement for the league, the Jets share MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey with the New York Giants. The franchise is legally and corporately registered as New York Jets, LLC. - Breast cancer screening is the medical screening of asymptomatic, apparently healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis. The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes. A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. - The Minnesota Vikings are an American football team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Vikings joined the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team in 1960, and first took the field for the 1961 season. The team competes in the National Football Conference (NFC) North division; before that, the Vikings were in the NFC Central, and before that they were in the NFL's Western Conference Central Division. The team has played in four Super Bowl games, but lost each one. The team plays its home games at U.S. Bank Stadium in the Downtown East section of Minneapolis. - Mastectomy (from Greek \\"breast\\" and \\"ektomia\\" \\"cutting out\\") is the medical term for the surgical removal of one or both breasts, partially or completely. - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment.

The Thomas Keller Surf n' Turf will make its debut in December at Bubbledogs, a tiny London restaurant that serves Champagne and dogs. It's a frankfurter topped with minced Cornish lobster, dill pickle chips and celery. It will cost £12 (14.60) and be available throughout the month. Thomas Keller. Photographer: Richard Vines/Bloomberg Bubbledogs owners Sandia Chang and James Knappett met while working at Per Se a decade ago, when he was a chef and she waited tables. They worked for Keller again when he opened the pop-up French Laundry at Harrods in London in 2011. The husband-and-wife team regularly invites chefs to create hot dogs for Bubbledogs. \\"We went Americana for this dog,\\" Keller said. It combines an American hot dog and a New England lobster roll. \\"We start with a traditional buttered brioche, like you’d find in a New England lobster roll. We layer the bun with house-made dill pickles, and then, for the 'relish,' we top the dog with chilled lobster salad and garnish it all with micro celery leaves. \\"I am a fan of both hot dogs and lobster rolls - childhood favorites, staples of sun-splashed picnics and afternoons spent at the ballpark.\\" This isn't Keller's first dog. He has also developed the Yountwurst, which takes its name from the town of Yountville, home of the French Laundry as well as his Bouchon bakery and Ad Hoc casual restaurant. Chang said Keller has always been supportive, showing up within two weeks of Bubbledogs and its sister restaurant Kitchen Table opening in 2012. Other fans include Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer, who visits when in London. \\"I always do my best to support our alumni when they light out on their own,\\" Keller said.

More accurately, she had hurled it to the floor in a fit of disillusionment, her small protest against the slow creep of mediocrity and missed cues during a four-hour dinner at Per Se that would cost the four of us close to 3,000. Some time later, a passing server picked up the napkin without pausing to see whose lap it was missing from, neatly embodying the oblivious sleepwalking that had pushed my guest to this point. Such is Per Se’s mystique that I briefly wondered if the failure to bring her a new napkin could have been intentional. The restaurant’s identity, to the extent that it has one distinct from that of its owner and chef, Thomas Keller, is based on fastidiously minding the tiniest details. This is the place, after all, that brought in a ballet dancer to help servers slip around the tables with poise. So I had to consider the chance that the server was just making a thoughtful accommodation to a diner with a napkin allergy. But in three meals this fall and winter, enough other things have gone awry in the kitchen and dining room to make that theory seem unlikely. Enough, also, to make the perception of Per Se as one of the country’s great restaurants, which I shared after visits in the past, appear out of date. Enough to suggest that the four-star rating it received from Sam Sifton in 2011, its most recent review in The New York Times, needs a hard look. With each fresh review, a restaurant has to earn its stars again. In its current form and at its current price, Per Se struggled and failed to do this, ranging from respectably dull at best to disappointingly flat-footed at worst. ||||| Chef Thomas Keller’s woes don’t seem to be abating. After a scathing New York Times review for his New York City restaurant Per Se in January (and a similar review from Eater), Keller, as well as The French Laundry in Napa Valley, and the Thomas Keller Restaurant Group are all being sued for pregnancy discrimination. Filed last month in Napa Superior Court, the Napa Valley Register reports that the lawsuit alleges that Vanessa Scott-Allen was prevented from working at The French Laundry because of her pregnancy. According to the Napa Valley Register, the complaint alleges that the restaurant group had approved a transfer of her job from Per Se to The French Laundry, but when TFL found out about her pregnancy, they terminated the offer — after she had left her five-year-old serving position at Per Se and moved her family out to California. According to the Napa Valley Register, Scott-Allen claims that after a visit to TFL in January when general manager Michael Minnillo (also named in the suit) told her that the restaurant “would love” to have her work there, she approached her Per Se manager Antonio Begonja about wanting to transfer, and notified him of her pregnancy. Reportedly, the managers worked out the transfer, and Scott-Allen said she was set to work at TFL starting on April 1, before which time she terminated her lease in New York, bought a car, and found a place to live in California. Scott-Allen’s start date was allegedly pushed back to April 4, when she claims that TFL manager Olivia Wallace asked her several questions about her pregnancy and plans for maternity leave, such as her due date, how long she would work until giving birth, and how long she planned for maternity leave. After that encounter, Scott-Allen was told the position was no longer available, nor was any other position (despite there being three positions open), according to the Napa Valley Register’s account of the lawsuit. The Napa Valley Register reports that on April 21, Scott-Allen filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and received a notice of case closure and right to sue, after which she filed the lawsuit in Napa Superior Court on September 26. The article states that she is seeking 5 million in damages for fraud and deceit, sex discrimination, violation of pregnancy disability leave law, negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied contract, wrongful termination, failure to prevent discrimination, and violations of labor codes and the California Family Rights Act. A case management conference is scheduled for March 7, 2017. Scott-Allen is reportedly demanding a jury trial. Eater SF has reached out to both The Thomas Keller Restaurant Group and Scott-Allen’s attorney for comment, with no immediate response.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which camera would have higher beam quality? David needs to purchase a camera for his photography class. He went to the local consumer electronics store to find himself a good camera. Two cameras caught his eye, camera A and camera B. Camera A had a very small pinhole, but camera B had larger aperture. David needs to decide which camera should he buy. Hint: In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and its wavelength (longer wavelengths require larger apertures). If the hole is too small, the beam quality is greatly improved but the power is greatly reduced. If the hole is too large, the beam quality may not be improved as much as desired. The size of aperture that can be used also depends on the size and quality of the optics. To use a very small pinhole, one must use a focusing lens with a low f-number, and ideally the lens should not add significant aberrations to the beam. The design of such a lens becomes increasingly more difficult as the f-number decreases. A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, camera A with a very small pinhole would have a higher beam quality compared to camera B with a larger aperture. This is due to the fact that smaller apertures (or pinholes) improve beam quality. However, it should be noted that the power is greatly reduced if the hole is too small, which may affect overall image quality and brightness. In practice, the diameter of the aperture is chosen based on several factors including the focal length of the lens, the diameter and quality of the input beam, and the wavelength (with longer wavelengths requiring larger apertures).

While camera A is likely to have higher beam quality, David should consider other factors mentioned above before making a decision on which camera to purchase. Both cameras may have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it would be important for David to evaluate them based on his specific photography class requirements and personal preferences. In addition, he should research other aspects of the cameras, such as sensor size, image stabilization, and overall ease of use, to ensure that he selects the best option for his needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For the second time in three weeks, the Patriots went on the road to square off against an undefeated team; the 10-0 Saints entered the game with the most points scored in the league. After the Patriots deferred the opening coin toss, the Saints returned the opening kickoff to their own 35-yard line before a 33-yard pass from Drew Brees to wide receiver Devery Henderson on the game's first play put the Saints quickly in Patriots territory. However, the Patriots defense stopped the Saints on a 3rd-and-4 from the 15-yard line, setting up a 30-yard John Carney field goal. The Patriots responded by holding the ball for nearly eight minutes, advancing 80 yards on a 14-play drive that ended in a 4-yard touchdown run by Maroney on 4th-and-1, the second such conversion of the drive. The score put the Patriots ahead 7-3. The Saints did not reach midfield on their next drive and punted; however, the Patriots turned the ball back over when on the ensuing play Brady was intercepted by cornerback Mike McKenzie, who returned it eight yards to the Saints' 41-yard line. Seven plays later, early in the second quarter, the Saints took a 10-7 lead when a Brees dump-off pass to running back Pierre Thomas resulted in an 18-yard touchdown. The Patriots could not reach midfield on their next possession and punted. On the ensuing play, Brees connected with Henderson on a 75-yard touchdown pass that extended the Saints' lead to 17-7. The Patriots faced a 3rd-and-12 early on their next drive, but Brady threw a 33-yard pass to Aiken to move the Patriots into Saints territory. The drive stalled at the Saints' 18-yard line, forcing a 36-yard Gostkowski field goal to cut the Saints' lead to 17-10. Four plays later, Brees hit former Patriots tight end David Thomas on a 25-yard pass before wide receiver Robert Meachem caught a 38-yard touchdown pass to give the Saints a 24-10 lead with just under two minutes left in the half. The Patriots' offense was able to reach the Saints' 32-yard line on first down with 35 seconds left, but advanced no further, setting up a 50-yard Gostkowski field goal attempt on fourth down that fell wide left. With possession to begin the second half, the Patriots lost it when a 6-yard pass to Maroney, the first play of the half, resulted in a fumble by Maroney at the Patriots' 26-yard line. Saints defensive tackle Sedrick Ellis recovered the fumble and returned it seven yards before he too fumbled; Welker recovered the ball for the Patriots at that spot. Later in the drive, on 3rd-and-9 from their own 42-yard line, Brady hit Aiken on an 11-yard pass to convert; on the play, Brady passed Drew Bledsoe as the Patriots' all-time passing leader. Two plays later, Brady connected with Moss on a 47-yard pass down to the Saints' 2-yard line, setting up a 2-yard Maroney touchdown run that cut the Saints' lead to 24-17. However, the Saints responded on their next play with a 68-yard pass from Brees to wide receiver Marques Colston, setting up a 2-yard touchdown catch by tight end Darnell Dinkins two plays later, re-establishing a 14-point Saints lead. The Patriots moved down to the Saints' 10-yard on their next drive, but attempted to convert on 4th-and-4 from that spot instead of kicking a field goal; Brady's pass attempt to Moss fell incomplete. The Saints' next drive spanned into the fourth quarter but ended on a punt from the Saints' own 35-yard line. The Patriots fared no better, going three-and-out on their ensuing possession. The Saints continued to build a lead when Brees ended a 9-play, 75-yard drive with a 20-yard touchdown pass to Colston. Down 38-17 with under eight minutes to go, the Patriots tried to mount a drive but two plays in, Brady was intercepted by safety Darren Sharper on a deep pass; Sharper returned it 38 yards to the Patriots' 25-yard line. However, the Saints could not convert a first down and Carney missed a 37-yard field goal wide right. With 5:26 remaining in the game and down 21 points, the Patriots replaced Brady with his backup, Hoyer, on their next possession; the Patriots went three-and-out. After a Saints punt, the Patriots held the ball for the final 1:52 of the game, ending it on an 8-yard sack of Hoyer. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 7-4 on the season, and 1-4 in road games.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge. Now, I have a new situation: John wanted to charge his electronic gadgets remotely. To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C. Answer this question please: Would the objects be closer to or farther from each other in case A than in case B? Answer:","completion":"The objects would be closer to each other in case A than in case B. In case A (charging by conduction), the objects need to physically touch each other for the charge transfer to occur. In case B (charging by induction), the objects do not touch each other and charging occurs by influencing the charge distribution on the uncharged object by bringing the charged object close to it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Verstappen is just 16-years-old and has just earned his superlicence. Superlicence necessary for drivers to compete in Formula One.","completion":"Title: The Prodigy on Track: Young Phenom Max Verstappen to Drive for Toro Rosso In a shifting tide of expectations and emerging talents, Red Bull junior team, Toro Rosso, makes a truly groundbreaking announcement for the upcoming season. The Formula One circuit will be graced by the prodigious talent of Max Verstappen, making him the youngest professional driver in the history of the elite competition. Born on September 30, 1997, Verstappen is barely 16-years-old, making his selection by Toro Rosso a testament to an unprecedented level of confidence in the young driver’s skills and potential. Given the challenges and demands of Formula One racing, this decision speaks volumes about Verstappen's extraordinary abilities and commitment to the sport. Verstappen has already orchestrated a resounding performance in a stunningly small amount of time, having just earned his superlicence, a prerequisite for those desiring to compete in the gruelling and prestigious Formula One Championships. The superlicence, administered by the International Automobile Federation (FIA), serves as the highest racing license issued by the body. That Verstappen has managed to secure it at such a tender age showcases his burgeoning talent, a talent poised to reshape limits and redefine norms in the world of Formula One racing. Being awarded a superlicence necessarily implies the driver's capability and readiness to compete at the Formula One level. The procedure to earn this benchmark includes various stringent parameters like driving a current car consistently at racing speeds, demonstrating understanding of racing theory, and showcasing practical knowledge like signalling an intent to overtake, among others. The FIA doesn’t award this badge of honor lightly; it is a bragging right reserved only for those who exhibit exceptional skills, technical know-how, sportsman spirit, and relentless commitment. Piloting a Formula One car requires not only an ability to drive fast but also a deep technical understanding of the car, strategic application of speed and endurance, and an ability to respond swiftly and calmly under high-pressure situations. This all-encompassing readiness is what Verstappen has demonstrated, outpacing his peers to secure a spot at the starting line of the world’s highest-level of open-wheel car racing. Verstappen's success marks a landmark moment for Toro Rosso and Red Bull's driver programme, which aims at nurturing young talents and preparing them for the top tier of motorsports. His signing represents a triumph for talent scouting and youth development in motorsports, reinforcing the notion that age is merely a number when it comes to talent, hard work, and achieving victory at the pinnacle of sport. Expectations are high for Verstappen, but this is territory he is familiar with. Now, armed with his FIA superlicence, the trust and backing of Toro Rosso, and an innate ability to deliver on track, this Dutch teenager is set to make his mark on Formula One. As the motorsport world prepares for the roar of the engines in the upcoming season, all eyes will be on Verstappen, the 16-year-old prodigy, redefining what's possible on the F1 circuits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Further, the customer's rating of \\"The Phoenix\\" is quite impressive—with a full 5 out of 5 stars. This kind of high rating usually signifies very high customer satisfaction, indicating that patrons of the restaurant have had positive experiences with their visits. They likely appreciate the food's quality and taste, as well as other factors like customer service, ambiance, cleanliness, and value for money. This score further strengthens the appeal of the restaurant, as potential customers often trust reviews and ratings to provide a trustworthy judgment of a place they haven't personally visited. Finally, the data states that \\"The Phoenix\\" is located in the city centre. This is often a business-heavy and bustling location, often populated with various restaurants, shops, offices, and sometimes residential spaces. These places are typically easy to locate and access, with several transport links and a high footfall.

While both swimmers have pictures taken of them, Taeyeon calls Sehee out from the crowd and gets her to pose with them for a picture. The scene shifts to two years later. At the pool, a member of the swim team, Kyunghee, goes for a practice swim in the pool but is suddenly dragged underwater by a mysterious black smoke. Kyunghee struggles, but then spots a corpse-like figure staring back at her and screams.The school is in the middle of final exams. Narae, tired of studying, makes no real attempt at the test.

'The editorial staff continues to object to the use of the word,' Capsis wrote to The Post.

Write a question about the following article: Reagan significantly increased public expenditures, primarily the Department of Defense, which rose (in constant 2000 dollars) from 267.1 billion in 1980 (4.9% of GDP and 22.7% of public expenditure) to 393.1 billion in 1988 (5.8% of GDP and 27.3% of public expenditure); most of those years military spending was about 6% of GDP, exceeding this number in 4 different years. All these numbers had not been seen since the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973. In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the maximum tax rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%. The federal deficit under Reagan peaked at 6% of GDP in 1983, falling to 3.2% of GDP in 1987 and to 3.1% of GDP in his final budget. The inflation-adjusted rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. This was the slowest rate of growth in inflation adjusted spending since Eisenhower. However, federal deficit as percent of GDP was up throughout the Reagan presidency from 2.7% at the end of (and throughout) the Carter administration. As a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from 997 billion to 2.85 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the worlds largest international creditor to the worlds largest debtor nation.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Thursday pushed back against a North Korean state media report that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during this week’s Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un to gradually lift sanctions against Pyongyang, saying Trump had been very clear about the sequence of steps in the process. The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program.

Nigeria, who failed to qualify for the last two editions of the tournament, fell to their first competitive defeat to South Africa, losing 2-0 in Uyo in the Group E match. Second-half goals from Tokelo Rantie and Percy Tau sealed a deserved win for Bafana Bafana against three-time African champions Nigeria. Rantie opened the scoring with a brilliant close-range header in the 54th minute. Tau broke free in a swift counter-attack, putting the ball around goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi before slotting home in the 81st minute. Nigeria fluffed chances in the first half as Wilfred Ndidi, Oghenekaro Etebo and Simon Moses failed to score. It was second time lucky for coach Stuart Baxter who was in charge when Bafana beat Nigeria 2-1 in the 2004 Nelson Mandela challenge at home. The twelve group winners plus the best three group runners-up will qualify for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations along with the hosts Cameroon. Seydou Doumbia's brace was not enough for Ivory Coast as the Elephants were beaten 3-2 at home by Guinea in Group H. Doumbia gave the home side a 15th minute lead, before Guinea equalised in the 32nd minute. Naby Keita's shot was spilled by goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo and Abdoulaye Sadio Diallo pounced on the rebound to put the visitors level. Doumbia grabbed his second goal in the 62nd minute, but four minutes later France-based Francois Kamano made it 2-2. However, the impressive Naby Keita sealed the stunning win for Guinea in the 79th minute to complete a bad start for new Ivory Coast manager Marc Wilmots. The defeat for Ivory Coast in Bouake came just five days after the death of former Ivorian international Cheick Tiote. In Ndola, former winners Zambia were left stunned by a late goal as they lost 1-0 to Mozambique at home in Group K. Mozambique left it until the 89th minute to earn their first ever win over Chipolopolo with Germany-based Stanley Ratifo scoring the goal. 2012 African champions Zambia dominated the encounter for long spells but failed to turn their superiority into goals. The Mambas made them pay for their profligacy when Ratifo finished brilliantly from a cut-back to stun the home side. Elias Pelembe should have doubled the lead in added time but goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene rushed out of his box to stop the Bidvest Wits winger. Coach Abel Xavier and the Mambas held on to celebrate a first triumph over Zambia in 18 attempts. In the other Group K game, Guinea-Bissau beat visitors Namibia 1-0 thanks to a powerful header from Jerson in the 24th minute. Veteran striker Aristide Bance scored twice as Burkina Faso beat Angola 3-1 in Group I. Bance's opening goal in the 22nd minute was quickly cancelled out by Gelson Dala a minute later. Bance then restored the lead from the penalty spot just before half-time with Chelsea winger Betrand Traore scoring the third in the 79th minute. Also in Group I, Mohamed Abdellahi Soudani's second-half strike sealed a famous 1-0 win for Mauritania away to Botswana. Senegal hammered Equatorial Guinea 3-0 in Dakar in Group A on Saturday after Moussa Sow scored in both halves and Idrissa Gana Gueye added a late third. Elsewhere on Saturday, Gerald Phiri Junior scored the only goal as Malawi began their Group B campaign with a 1-0 home win over Comoros in Lilongwe. The South Africa-based winger hit a free-kick from outside the 18 yard box which flew over the wall and into the right corner on 31 minutes . The flames had several chances but failed to punish a resolute Comoros. It is a first competitive win for Malawi's coach Ronny Van Geneugden who took over in April. Malawi have taken an early advantage in the group after hosts Cameroon beat Herve Renard's Morocco 1-0 in Yaounde. A 29th minute goal from Vincent Aboubakar gave the Indomitable Lions the victory which puts Morocco bottom of Group B after the opening round of matches. Cameroon qualify automatically as hosts for the 2019 Nations Cup, but their group matches still count as qualifiers for their opponents. After the victory, Cameroon's coach Hugo Broos confirmed that defender Oyongo Bitolo would definitely miss the Fifa Confederations Cup later this month. The player was stretchered off the pitch after suffering a knee ligament injury which Broos said would keep him out of the game for seven months. Mali fought back with second-half goals from Kalifa Coulibaly and Yves Bissouma to beat Gabon 2-1 in Bamako in Group C. Lorient midfielder Denis Bouanga had given the visitors a shock early lead. Burundi stay top of Group C after their impressive 3-0 win over South Sudan. The Swallows secured all three points with first half goals. Cedric Amissi set the tone with the opening goal in the 15th minute. Gael Duhayinnavyi added the second ten minutes later before Fiston Abdul Razak made it three in the 30th minute. In Freetown, goals from Julius Woobay and and Umaru Bangura penalty helped Sierra Leone make a winning start to their Group F campaign as they beat Kenya 2-1. Kenya had Brian Mandela sent off but they did get a consolation goal through Michael Olunga. Ghana take on Ethiopia in that group on Sunday. Spain-based Cedric Bakambu grabbed a brace as DR Congo beat neighbours Congo Brazzaville 3-1 in Group G. Bakambu scored opened the scoring in the 20th minute.

Firstly, the title \\"BEWARE!!\\" clearly indicates a warning to potential customers and sets a negative tone for the review. This exclamation signals that the customer is likely to have had an unfavorable or dissatisfying experience with the product and/or the company. Furthermore, the content of the review elaborates on the negative experience the customer faced. The customer states that they bought a packaged deal but did not receive one of the items they paid for – the Weighted Butterfly Pool Head. This demonstrates that the customer's expectations were not met, leading to their dissatisfaction with the product and the company. Additionally, the customer highlights the \\"very poor customer service\\" they encountered while dealing with this issue. This negative statement emphasizes their frustration and discontent with not only the product but also the company's response to their problem.

Please answer the following question: Question: What will telling many people about someone's escapades lead to? Options: - annoyance - notoriety - emotional distress - religion - riot Explain why a human would choose \\"notoriety\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"notoriety\\" to answer the question above because telling many people about someone's escapades, which are usually daring, exciting, or unusual adventures, can make that person widely known, especially for those escapades. Notoriety refers to the state of being famous or well-known for a negative reason or a particular quality, which in this case would be the person's escapades. The more people who know about these events, the more likely the person's actions and reputation will spread, resulting in notoriety. While the other options may have some relevance in specific situations, they are generally less applicable as general outcomes in comparison to notoriety: - Annoyance: This may be a possible outcome, but it depends on the person hearing about the escapades and their personal opinion. Not everyone will be annoyed by this information, so it's not the most appropriate general outcome. - Emotional distress: It's possible that the subject of the stories may experience emotional distress, but again, it's not a universal consequence and would depend on the specific context and the person involved. - Religion: This is unrelated to the scenario of telling people about someone's escapades and would not be an expected outcome. - Riot: While people might become impassioned or agitated upon hearing about someone's escapades, it would take a much more significant event or issue to provoke an entire riot. Therefore, notoriety is the most fitting answer given the context of the question, as it is the most likely outcome of widely sharing someone's escapades among many people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy. Later, just at the peak of tension between families, it emerges that Roman has made a bad investment and is broke. He has not told Kate and was planning to hit up Chet for the cash. Later, during a thunderstorm, the twins wander off and fall into a mine shaft. Chet and Roman find them, but the claustrophobic Roman is reluctant to descend into the tiny mine shaft. After some encouragement from Chet, Roman summons up all his courage, while Chet goes in search of a rope to pull them out. Upon realizing that the mine is stocked with old dynamite, Roman takes his daughters and climbs out of the shaft on his own., can you guess it ?

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art?

Please answer the following question: The two basic things you have to do to have a successful weight-loss journey is consume fewer calories (eat less) and exercise more. It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace? Options: A. More calories will be burned B.

Writer/Director Peter Greenaway cements his title as the High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-indulgence, 8 ½ Women.

Think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive, and chances are Greenaway's done it. The female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of.

It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum. - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans.

As a form of Western esotericism, the New Age movement drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of Emanuel Swedenborg and Franz Mesmer, as well as the ideas of Spiritualism, New Thought, and the Theosophical Society. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the UFO religions of the 1950s, the Counterculture of the 1960s, and the Human Potential Movement, also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age movement. Although the exact origins of the movement remain contested, it is agreed that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age movement have been identified. Theologically, the movement typically adopts a belief in a holistic form of divinity which imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as angels and masters, with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of channeling....

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was holding hands with Gavin?, using the article: In 1993, Michael Jackson was accused of sexually molesting 13-year-old Jordan Chandler. Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it had been filed too late, and in 2017 it was ruled that neither of the corporate entities formerly owned by Jackson could be held accountable for Jackson's alleged actions.In the film, Robson, Safechuck, and their respective families describe their relationship with Jackson. Safechuck and Robson allege that Jackson sexually abused them at his home, Neverland Ranch, and at his other residences across California.Reed described his film as a \\"study of the psychology of child sexual abuse, told through two ordinary families who were groomed for 20 years by a paedophile masquerading as a trusted friend\\"., what would be the answer ?

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Telemundo Beauty Liza Irizarry Allegedly Attacked by Model Selita Ebanks in Miami Nightclub Altercation Introduction: An altercation between Telemundo actress and model Liza Irizarry and supermodel Selita Ebanks reportedly took place in a Miami nightclub, leaving the former with facial injuries. Liza Irizarry, best known for her work on popular Spanish-language network Telemundo, was allegedly assaulted by Ebanks when the latter observed her giving Ebanks' boyfriend, Terence J, a friendly peck on the cheek. The incident has sparked conversations regarding escalating tensions and outbursts of violence within the nightlife scene. The Incident: According to various sources present at the club, Liza Irizarry approached Terence J, a former E! News host and close associate, to greet him with a customary and innocent peck on the cheek. Irizarry's friendly gesture reportedly incensed Selita Ebanks, who, allegedly inebriated, confronted the actress, ultimately leading to a physical confrontation in which Ebanks supposedly punched Irizarry in the face. The Bystanders’ Perspectives: Witnesses claim that the Miami nightclub was abuzz with shocked patrons witnessing the exchange between Irizarry and Ebanks and have corroborated the unfolding of events that led to the brawl. Some onlookers have even attested to seeing a visibly inebriated Ebanks reacting furiously to what many interpreted as a friendly interaction between Irizarry and Terence J. Several bystanders also recollected other attendees at the venue attempting to diffuse the situation, albeit to no avail. The Aftermath: As a result of the incident, Liza Irizarry purportedly sustained a facial injury on her nose and experienced considerable distress following the altercation with Selita Ebanks. While Irizarry has not issued a formal statement regarding the situation, sources close to her have asserted that she was deeply shaken and upset by the unexpected altercation. Selita Ebanks, a renowned model who has graced the Victoria's Secret runway and appeared in numerous ad campaigns for major fashion brands, has also remained silent on the matter. Representatives for both Irizarry and Ebanks have not provided any official response or comment concerning the events at the Miami nightclub. Terence J, who was purportedly present during the scuffle, has yet to address or acknowledge the incident publicly. Conclusion: The alleged altercation between Liza Irizarry and Selita Ebanks has elicited mixed reactions, with many condemning Ebanks' supposed violent behavior and lamenting the rapid escalation of what should have been an innocuous encounter. Critics cite the incident as symptomatic of the underlying issues within the fast-paced world of celebrities, where indulgence and excess often give rise to such altercations. As the story continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether both parties will address the situation and what legal ramifications, if any, may ensue. Until then, the Miami nightclub incident involving Telemundo actress Liza Irizarry and model Selita Ebanks will serve as a cautionary tale for those involved in the high-stakes, glamorous, and sometimes tumultuous realm of celebrity nightlife."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This will give you a clear idea of the distance and elevation of the ground before you putt. Set the ball near your front foot. By examining the putting surface from these different angles, you are able to understand the various slopes and subtle changes in elevation that can affect the path of your putt. Once you have assessed the terrain around the hole, approach your ball and take your stance with the ball near your front foot. This position facilitates a smooth, slightly upward stroke, which can help maintain a consistent roll on the green. As you focus on your stroke mechanics, be mindful of your grip pressure and alignment, ensuring that they remain consistent throughout your putting routine. Take practice swings to feel the tempo and rhythm of your putting stroke. Trust in the information gathered from your initial assessment of the green and visualize a specific target line for your putt. When you are ready to make the actual putt, maintain your focus and commit to your intended line. Keep your head and body still as you execute a smooth, controlled stroke, allowing the putter to follow through naturally. Watch the ball roll along the target line and observe its behavior as it nears the hole. Once your putt is complete, take a moment to evaluate the outcome. Did the ball follow your intended line? Did it stop short or roll past the hole? Use this information to adjust your strategy and approach as necessary for future putts. With practice, persistence, and careful analysis of each putting scenario, you will begin to see improvements in your putting, leading to lower scores and greater success on the golf course."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -2*p = -4*p for p.","completion":"To solve the equation -2*p = -4*p for the variable p, we will follow these steps: 1. Start with the given equation: -2*p = -4*p 2. Our goal is to isolate the variable p. In order to do that, first, we'll identify the terms with the variable p on both sides of the equation. We have -2*p on the left side and -4*p on the right side. 3. Now, we'll move all the terms with the variable p to one side of the equation to form a new equation. In this case, let's move the term -4*p to the left side by adding 4*p to both sides of the equation: -2*p + 4*p = -4*p + 4*p 4. Simplify both sides of the equation: 2*p = 0 5. Now we are left with the equation 2*p = 0. To solve for p, we need to isolate the variable p by dividing both sides of the equation by 2: (2*p) / 2 = 0 / 2 6.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Corey Todd Taylor (born December 8, 1973) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, actor, and author, best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the bands Slipknot and Stone Sour. Taylor formed Stone Sour in 1992, playing in the Des Moines area, and working on a demo. He joined Slipknot in 1997 to replace their original vocalist and has subsequently released five studio albums with them. After the first two Slipknot albums went Platinum, Taylor revived Stone Sour to record an album and tour in 2002. Corey Todd Taylor was born on December 8, 1973 in Des Moines, Iowa. He was mostly raised by his single mother in Waterloo, Iowa, a place described by Taylor as a \\"hole in the ground with buildings around it\\". He is of Irish, German and Native American descent on his father's side, and Dutch and Irish on his mother's side. In 1979, Taylor and his mother saw the sci-fi series Buck Rogers in the 25th Century. Before the series, there was a trailer for the 1978 horror film Halloween. Taylor said this \\"developed some sense of Slipknot in [himself]\\". While Halloween introduced Taylor to masks and horror themes, Taylor's grandmother introduced him to rock music, showing him a collection of Elvis Presley records from the 1950s to 1970s. He especially found songs like \\"Teddy Bear\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", and \\"Suspicious Minds\\" to appeal to his interests the most, describing them as \\"good times\\". Taylor also began listening to Black Sabbath at a young age, beginning with their early work. Taylor, along with his mother and sister, lived at one point in an \\"old dilapidated farmhouse\\" which on days in late autumn would \\"look like Black Sabbath album covers\\". By age 15, he had developed a drug addiction and had overdosed on cocaine twice. By this time, he was living in Waterloo, but later set out on his own and ended up at his grandmother's house in Des Moines. She took legal custody of him so that he could continue going to school, and she helped him buy musical equipment. When Taylor was 18, he left his grandmother's house and went to various places in Iowa, Des Moines being a place to which he frequently returned. In 2017, on an episode of Viceland's The Therapist, Taylor revealed that he was sexually assaulted at the age of 10 by a 16-year-old friend. Taylor stated that he never told anyone about the incident until he was \\"probably 18\\" because his abuser \\"threatened to hurt [him] and threatened to hurt [his] mom\\". At age 18, when Taylor was living with his grandmother, he attempted suicide by way of overdose. His ex-girlfriend's mother drove him to the hospital in Des Moines and doctors were able to resuscitate him. He describes this as the lowest point in his life. Taylor first met his father when he was 30 years old, and now has a relationship with him, although he said their paths do not cross that often.

By choosing a top that is fitted, you will be balancing out the look and enhancing your feminine curves. Try pairing your tulle skirt with a soft, form-fitting scoop neck sweater or a delicate fitted blouse. Look for tops with feminine cuts as well. For example, you could choose a top that reveals a bit of your chest, shoulders, or back. Lace is another great way to intensify the femininity of your tulle skirt. Try wearing a tulle skirt with a form fitting lace top or a top that has lace details. For example, you can look for a tank top with lace around the neckline, a long sleeved top made entirely of lace material, or a blouse that has a wide strip of lace down the front. A masculine touch can make for an interesting pairing, and emphasize the contrast between your skirt and top. Try wearing your tulle skirt with a plaid flannel shirt or a plain white button down shirt to get this contrasting effect. Other ways to add a masculine touch to your tulle skirt look is to wear a denim shirt or a band t-shirt. Both of these tops will contrast with the feminine, fluffy skirt in a fun way. Pairing your tulle shirt with a simple top can tone down a tulle skirt for casual daytime activities, and make it easier to transition your look from day to night. Try wearing your tulle skirt with a plain white t-shirt, band t-shirt, or a solid tank top for a toned down daytime look. Carry a cardigan, shrug, or shawl that you can slip on later in the day to transition your tulle skirt look from day to night. Make your look more glamorous with some decadent jewelry, like a pearl necklace, so diamond (faux or real) studs, or some gold bangles.

The thicker the blanket gets, the warmer it gets inside it. When we do activities that produce more greenhouse gases, like driving cars and using electricity from burning coal, our ecological footprint increases. This means we leave a larger mark on the Earth and affect its ecosystems more since we are warming up the Earth. This is called the greenhouse effect. We can reduce the effect by doing things that lessen the greenhouse gases we create. We can use energy from the sun, wind, and water instead of burning coal; ride bikes or walk instead of driving cars and also, we can plant more trees and plants. Small plants also help reduce the green house effect because they clean the air by taking in the carbon dioxide, which is one of the greenhouse gases, and give out oxygen that we breathe.

He says that \\"insects may live in large colonies and have complex social behaviors\\" and \\"honey Bee Honey bees are insects that live in a hive and make honey\\". So, what's the best answer to the question?","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What lives in large colonies?\\" appears to be insects, specifically honey bees. Honey bees, as mentioned by the teacher, are insects that live in hives and make honey. These hives can house thousands of individual bees, forming a large and complex colony. Honey bee colonies consist of a single queen, many worker bees (which are all female), and a smaller number of male bees called drones. The queen bee is the mother of all the bees in the colony and is responsible for laying eggs. Worker bees, on the other hand, perform various tasks crucial to hive life, such as foraging for nectar and pollen, caring for larvae, building honeycomb, and protecting the colony from potential threats. Drones have the sole purpose of mating with the queen. The complex social behavior in honey bee colonies is remarkable. They communicate through a variety of methods, such as pheromones and intricate dances that convey information about food sources and potential dangers. This highly organized and cooperative system allows honey bees to work together efficiently and maintain the colony's overall health and productivity. Furthermore, honey bees are not the only insects that live in large colonies. Other examples include ants, termites, and certain wasp species. These insects also exhibit complex social behaviors and live in highly organized and structured colonies where individual members have specific roles and responsibilities. This system of social organization is termed eusociality, and it is a characteristic found in some animal species that allows them to live in large colonies with complex social structures. In conclusion, given the teacher's hints, the best answer to the question \\"What lives in large colonies?\\" is insects, particularly honey bees, as they display sophisticated social behaviors and have a highly organized system that supports their large colonies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Build a movie plot around this: What banned writings was Sonmi introduced to? of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Answer:","completion":"Title: Unshackled Pages Genre: Drama, Thriller Setting: A dystopian future society in which literature is monitored and controlled by an oppressive government. Plot: In the not-too-distant future, Sonmi, a young and passionate librarian, secretly seeks out banned writings in an attempt to learn the truth about her society and the suppressed history that has shaped it. Over the years, she has amassed a clandestine collection of forbidden texts hidden within the depths of the library's restricted archives, away from prying government eyes. One day, Sonmi encounters a particular piece of banned literature that will change her life forever—an anthology of works by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. As Sonmi delves into Solzhenitsyn's writings, she is captivated by his powerful stories of human perseverance, resistance, and courage in the face of tyranny. These stories resonate deeply with Sonmi, who lives under an increasingly oppressive regime, and she is inspired to take action. Gradually, she starts to rally a group of like-minded individuals who've also secretly read Solzhenitsyn's works, and together they form the \\"Unshackled Pages,\\" a group dedicated to resisting government control and spreading the message of freedom and resistance found in banned literature. However, the group's actions do not go unnoticed for long. Government surveillance exposes their activities and starts to hunt them down ruthlessly. Members of the \\"Unshackled Pages\\" must learn to navigate this dangerous terrain, using their newfound knowledge from Solzhenitsyn's writings as a guide. In the end, Sonmi is forced to make a heart-wrenching decision—disband the group and flee or stay and fight for the freedom they've come to cherish. As the story unfolds, Sonmi and her fellow \\"Unshackled Pages\\" members must wrestle with the themes at the core of Solzhenitsyn's work: the price of individual freedom and the responsibility to resist injustice, no matter the cost. Through their struggle and sacrifice, they ultimately become modern embodiments of the same spirit of resilience that Solzhenitsyn captured in his texts. The film's climax sees Sonmi and her fellow group members risking everything in a daring mission to infiltrate the government's Department of Literature Control, exposing the truth about the regime's vast censorship efforts and empowering the people to reclaim their rightful freedoms. Their actions inspire a wave of rebellion, leading to a revolution that challenges the oppressive government. Unshackled Pages becomes a symbol of hope for a liberated future, echoing the message of Solzhenitsyn and his timeless works."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"When resting or sleeping, the body's oxygen requirements and consumption generally decrease due to reduced physical activity and metabolic demands. This change can indirectly impact the process of oxygen absorption in the lungs. Although the fundamental processes of air traveling into the body, reaching the lungs, and oxygen being transported by hemoglobin remain the same, some adjustments take place to accommodate the reduced oxygen needs. To understand the supposed perturbation during rest and sleep, let's analyze the potential effects on the oxygen absorption process: 1. Slower Breathing Rate: During rest and sleep, the breathing rate decreases as a response to reduced oxygen consumption. This slows down the rate at which air enters the body and reaches the lungs. This is an indirect step in the process because it doesn't change the absorption mechanism in the lungs but alters the rate at which oxygen becomes available. 2. Blood Circulation: In resting or sleeping states, the heart rate typically slows down, reducing the speed with which the blood circulates throughout the body. This indirectly impacts the rate of oxygen transportation by hemoglobin in the red blood cells. 3. Oxygen Demand by Cells: As the body's cells require less energy during rest and sleep, their demand for oxygen is lower than during periods of activity. This indirectly influences the lungs' absorption rate by creating a lower need for oxygen and, consequently, a slower transport of oxygen to the cells. 4. Lung Function Stability: Even during resting or sleeping states, the ability of the lungs to absorb oxygen remains fundamental to the body's needs and is not negatively impacted. In fact, resting may even enhance lung function by allowing the lungs to maintain their elasticity, an essential feature in the efficient absorption of oxygen from the air. To summarize, the supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. The resting or sleeping state influences the rate at which air enters the body and the subsequent oxygen demand and transport, but it does not directly impact the function or the mechanism of oxygen absorption in the lungs or the transportation of oxygen by hemoglobin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I think I want to live without money because I hate it. I HATE MONEY.\\" We were all touched by Maria's words as they reminded us of the spiritual burdens that money managing can bring to us. After class I offered to help Maria deal with her financial problems. She hesitated to accept my offer, and I could see from the expression on her face that she was afraid of what it might involve. I quickly promised her that I wouldn't make her do more than she was able to. I told her frankly that I didn't enjoy managing my money any more than she did hers and wouldn't burden her with guilt, judgments, or impossible tasks. All I would ask her to do was to let me help her look at her fears and try to make some sense of them. Maria still resisted my offer, and I can remember the excuses she gave me as they were the repeated complaints I had heard from so many people. \\"I'11 never understand money,\\" she said. \\"My facts are meaningless.\\" \\"I don't deserve to have money.\\" \\"I never have enough,\\" \\"I have too little to manage.\\" \\"My financial position isn't worth looking at.\\" and the most _ one of all, \\"I just can't do it.\\" Going home that day, I couldn't get Maria out of my mind: Her attitude conveyed the same negativity and fear that I believed annoyed many people.

Given the question: Information: - Bloomsbury is an area in the West End, central London, forming part of the London Borough of Camden and located between Euston Road and Holborn. It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton. - Herodotus (\\"Hródotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history. - Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East. It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state, until its lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. - Reign. Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. but due to the recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year. - Rusa II was king of Urartu between around 680 BC and 639 BC. It was during his reign that the massive fortress complex, Karmir-Blur, was constructed. - Cyaxares (\\"Uvaxštra\\", , ; r. 625585 BC), the son of King Phraortes, and according to Herodotus was the third and most capable king of Media. According to Herodotus, Cyaxares, grandson of Deioces, had a far greater military reputation than his father or grandfather. He was the first to divide his troops into separate sections of spearmen, archers, and horsemen. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south. - Rusa III was king of Urartu . He was called \`\` Son of Erimena , '' meaning that he was probably a brother of Rusa II. Little is known about his reign ; his name was inscribed on a massive granary at Armavir and on a series of bronze shields from the temple of Khaldi found at Rusahinili , now held in the British Museum . According to the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene , Rusa 's father Erimena can probably be identified with Paruyr Skayordi , who helped the Median king Cyaxares to conquer Assyria , for which Cyaxares recognized him as the king of Armenia , although the Medes ultimately reneged on this ; significantly later , during the reign of King Astyages , the Medes conquered and annexed Armenia . Rusa was the father of Sarduri IV. - Aššur (Akkadian; 'shr; : shr : shr, Kurdish Asûr), also known as Ashur and Qal'at Sherqat, was an Assyrian city, capital of the Old Assyrian Empire (20251750 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (13651050 BC), and for a time, the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911605 BC). The remains of the city are situated on the western bank of the Tigris River, north of the confluence with the tributary Little Zab River, in modern-day Iraq, more precisely in the Al-Shirqat District in the Saladin Governorate. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history. - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Pacing and Pausing Sara tried to befriend her old friend Steve's new wife, but Betty never seemed to have anything to say. While Sara felt Betty didn't hold up her end of the conversation, Betty complained to Steve that Sara never gave her a chance to talk. The problem had to do with expectations about pacing and pausing. Conversation is a turn-taking game. When our habits are similar, there's no problem. But if our habits are different, you may start to talk before I'm finished or fail to take your turn when I'm finished. That's what was happening with Betty and Sara. It may not be coincidental that Betty, who expected relatively longer pauses between turns, is British, and Sara, who expected relatively shorter pauses, is American. Betty often felt interrupted by Sara. But Betty herself became an interrupter and found herself doing most of the talking when she met a visitor from Finland. And Sara had a hard time cutting in on some speakers from Latin America or Israel. The general phenomenon, then, is that the small conversation techniques, like pacing and pausing, lead people to draw conclusions not about conversational style but about personality and abilities. These habitual differences are often the basis for dangerous stereotyping . And these social phenomena can have very personal consequences. For example, a woman from the southwestern part of the US went to live in an eastern city to take up a job in personnel. When the Personnel Department got together for meetings, she kept searching for the right time to break in -- and never found it. Although back home she was considered outgoing and confident, in Washington she was viewed as shy and retiring. When she was evaluated at the end of the year, she was told to take a training course because of her inability to speak up. That's why slight differences in conversational style -- tiny little things like microseconds of pause -- can have a great effect on one's life. The result in this cause was a judgment of psychological problems -- even in the mind of... Options: A Americans. B Israelis. C The British. D The Finns. Answer: B Israelis.

The airline announced last week it was ending its non-stop services from Albuquerque to San Francisco and Orange County because of a lack of demand. The Sunport says flights on the airline to Portland, Seattle and San Diego will remain. Meanwhile, Alaska Airlines says it will add direct daily flights from El Paso to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and San Diego International Airport. Hypothesis: Alaska airlines has no plans to add any flights in the near future.","completion":"Based on the context provided, we can draw the following hypothesis: Hypothesis: Alaska Airlines is adjusting its flight offerings by discontinuing certain non-stop flights from Albuquerque due to low demand and establishing new non-stop flights from El Paso to Seattle-Tacoma and San Diego. The context clearly states that Alaska Airlines is making changes to its flight routes. It is discontinuing two non-stop flights (\\"from Albuquerque to San Francisco and Orange County\\") due to the lack of demand. However, flights to Portland, Seattle, and San Diego will continue to be offered by the airline from Albuquerque International Sunport. Furthermore, the text also explicitly mentions that Alaska Airlines plans to add two new direct daily flights from El Paso to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and San Diego International Airport. Taking all this information into account, we can infer that the original hypothesis, \\"Alaska Airlines has no plans to add any flights in the near future,\\" is incorrect. Instead, the airline is both removing certain flights and adding new ones as a strategic response to fluctuating market demands.

Select the topic that this about: Tom Scheffler gets the same reaction whenever he takes consumers to an Internet cafe to show them a different kind of phone service.","completion":"The topic of discussion here is the adoption of alternative phone services, specifically at an Internet cafe, as introduced by Tom Scheffler. The focus will be on the reaction of consumers to this new kind of phone service and their perception of the benefits, drawbacks, and overall experience associated with it. Internet cafes have long been a hub for internet and computer usage, especially in areas where people lack personal access to the internet. Tom Scheffler, an advocate for alternative phone services, utilizes the popular setting of an Internet cafe to present an innovative telecommunications service to the public. By doing so, he aims to broaden the horizon of communication means for the average consumer and offer more cost-effective and convenient methods. While traditional phone services typically rely on regular telephone lines or mobile networks to establish connection, alternative phone services often rely on Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology. VoIP allows users to make voice calls using a broadband internet connection instead of conventional analog phone lines. This kind of technology has gained significant traction in recent years due to its cost-effective nature, especially for long-distance and international calls. Popular examples of VoIP services include Skype, Viber, and WhatsApp, which also provide video calling and messaging features. As Tom Scheffler demonstrates these alternative phone services at the Internet cafe, consumers often show reactions of surprise and curiosity. They may be intrigued by the service's ability to make calls at a fraction of the cost as compared to traditional methods. These reactions could be attributed to several factors, including the following: 1. Cost-efficiency: As mentioned earlier, VoIP-based phone services offer considerable savings compared to traditional phone services, especially for long-distance and international calls. These savings are a major attraction point for consumers who are often burdened by expensive phone bills on a monthly basis. 2. Ease of use: Alternative phone services often come with user-friendly interfaces and intuitive features that make navigation and usage quite simple. This factor is important for consumers who may not be well-versed in technology, as it reduces the learning curve associated with new devices and services. 3. Flexibility and adaptability: VoIP services can be accessed through various devices like smartphones, tablets, and computers. This provides users with the flexibility and convenience of communicating through their preferred device at any moment, as long as they have a stable internet connection. 4. Additional features: Apart from voice calls, alternative phone services also offer features like video calls, instant messaging, and file sharing. These additional services further enhance the appeal of alternative phone services to the consumer. Despite these benefits, consumers may also express concerns and doubts, such as the quality of calls over an internet connection, potential data breaches, or the possibility of unstable connections leading to dropped calls. Tom Scheffler, as a promoter of alternative phone services, needs to address these concerns and equip himself with adequate knowledge about the technology in order to reassure and educate the consumers properly. In conclusion, the topic revolves around the reactions of consumers to the alternative phone services presented by Tom Scheffler at an Internet cafe. The reactions usually include a mix of surprise, curiosity, and potential concerns. By addressing these concerns and showcasing the numerous benefits of alternative phone services, Tom Scheffler's demonstrations have the potential to convince more and more users to adopt and utilize these cost-effective and convenient communication methods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, what's the best answer to the question? Available choices: 1). oxygen debt; 2). rays or beams; 3). electromagnetic energy; 4). scattered light; 5). temperature; 6). shadow boxing; 7). ozone depletion; 8). redshift; Answer:","completion":"Answer: 3). electromagnetic energy Based on the hints provided by your teacher, we can deduce that the best answer to this quiz question is \\"electromagnetic energy.\\" This is because the hints relate to an increase in UV (ultraviolet) radiation, which is a form of electromagnetic energy, resulting in heightened risks for all types of skin cancer. Ozone depletion, as mentioned by the teacher, leads to higher levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth. Ultraviolet radiation is a type of electromagnetic energy that falls within the electromagnetic spectrum, a range of energies that includes visible light, radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays. UV radiation, in particular, has a wavelength shorter than visible light but longer than X-rays. The increased amount of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface due to ozone depletion can cause adverse effects on human health. One of these effects is an increased risk of skin cancer, as higher levels of UV radiation can cause damage to the DNA in skin cells. This damage may lead to mutations and, ultimately, the development of skin cancers such as melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. In conclusion, the best answer to the quiz question, \\"The risks of all types of skin cancer increases with increasing,\\" is \\"electromagnetic energy,\\" as increased levels of UV radiation - a form of electromagnetic energy - heighten the risk for all types of skin cancer. The other available choices do not directly relate to the hints provided by the teacher or the increased risk of skin cancer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

King's X is an American rock band that combines progressive metal, funk and soul with vocal arrangements influenced by gospel, blues, and British Invasion rock groups. The band's lyrics are largely based on the members' struggles with religion and self-acceptance. King's X was ranked No. 83 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band was moved up to Megaforce's parent label Atlantic Records for the release of their fourth album, King's X, in early 1992. However, rising tensions with Taylor led the band to eschew the upbeat approach of previous albums and turn out a darker, more introspective effort. Unfortunately, despite critical praise, their new style did not translate well among the record-buying public, thus garnering fewer sales than Faith, Hope, Love. \\"Black Flag\\", the album's lone single, received only moderate airplay on MTV and radio. Not long after the release of King's X, the band parted ways with Taylor. The details of the split were not made public, but it was believed to be rather bitter. Taylor would admit in 1996 that his company Wilde Silas MusicWorks was growing and, as a result, he was no longer giving King's X, whom he considered \\"the top dogs,\\" the attention they deserved. In the aftermath, King's X took over a year off to consider their collective future together. The band members followed other, non-musical pursuits; most notably, guitarist Ty Tabor took up semi-professional motocross motorcycle racing. With grunge at the peak of its popularity, and Pearl Jam's bassist Jeff Ament declaring that \\"King's X invented grunge\\" (despite the group's trademark sound being very different from that of the commercially successful grunge acts), the band went looking for a new sound upon their return. They enlisted veteran producer Brendan O'Brien, who had recently produced albums for Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam. The resulting album, 1994's Dogman, showcased a much more muscular and heavy sound from the group, along with less abstract and spiritual lyrics. The record received a heavier promotional push from Atlantic including a compilation promotional CD entitled: Building Blox, as King's X enjoyed a successful tour, capped by an appearance at the Woodstock '94 festival in August. They also toured in support of such bands as the Scorpions, Pearl Jam, Motley Crue and Type O Negative, but despite a return to the Top 100 for the group, the album failed to sell as well as Atlantic had hoped, and the label's support for the group quickly faded. The band's third release under Atlantic, 1996's Ear Candy, would also be their last for the label (not including a subsequent Best of King's X compilation). Although it sold to the band's sizeable core following, it lacked the relative mainstream success of previous efforts. The record was soon out of print, and it seemed that the group's chance for commercial success had come and gone.

Step 1: Identify the central incident - Opposition leader suffers a blow to the head during a protest The protest, aimed at voicing disagreement with the government's recent policies, quickly escalated into a chaotic scene, ultimately resulting in the opposition leader being struck. Witnesses report that law enforcement personnel were attempting to disperse the crowd when the opposition leader was accidentally hit. Step 2: Describe the consequences - Leader undergoing a medical scan due to concerns for a potential injury Owing to the severity of the blow, medical professionals advised the leader to get a comprehensive scan to assess the extent of any damage to their head. The specific type of scan being conducted is called a computed tomography (CT) scan, which allows doctors to capture a detailed view of the brain and skull in order to detect any fractures or brain injuries. Step 3: Explain the medical procedure - Use of a CT scan to detect potential skull fractures or brain injuries CT scans have become an indispensable tool in diagnosing and treating severe head injuries. The technology uses a series of X-ray images and advanced software to generate cross-sectional images of the brain and skull. This provides doctors with valuable information about the location, extent, and severity of any potential fractures or damage. Step 4: Address the public's concerns and expectations As news of the opposition leader's injury spreads, citizens and fellow party members have expressed their concern and support for the leader's recovery. Many are anxiously awaiting the result of the scan to see if any severe injuries have been identified. The opposition party has already issued a statement expressing their intent to cooperate with authorities in investigating the incident and to pursue any legal action if deemed necessary. Step 5: Discuss the potential implications on the political situation The outcome of this event could have significant implications on the nation's political landscape, depending on the severity of the opposition leader's injuries. If the leader is unable to return to their duties in the foreseeable future, this could lead to a power vacuum within the opposition party and a potential shift in political dynamics. In conclusion, the opposition leader is currently undergoing a CT scan for a suspected skull fracture brain injury sustained during a protest. The results of this scan will be crucial in determining the extent of the damage and possible consequences for the individual and their party. As the nation awaits further news, the implications of this incident underscore the importance of safety and adherence to peaceful protest protocols."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Donald's car faced some issues while he was driving back home from work one evening. He had heard of Joseph's reputed auto repair shop in town and knew he could rely on him to fix his car. After he contacted the shop, Joseph arrived promptly to tow the vehicle back to the garage. While Joseph worked on the car, Donald waited patiently in the waiting room, flipping through a magazine. The situation was an inconvenience, but he couldn't be too upset. Donald knew that Joseph was renowned for his exceptional work and attention to detail when it came to repairing vehicles. Joseph's auto repair shop had been in business for over 20 years, and it was the go-to place for locals who needed their cars fixed. As the son of an extraordinary mechanic, Joseph grew up learning the techniques and tools of the trade. His father taught him everything he knew, making sure his son was ready to take over the family business when the time came. Joseph treated all his clients with respect and kindness, ensuring they understood the repairs that needed to be done and the costs involved. It was his transparent and honest approach to business that built trust within the community and solidified his reputation. Donald had always been cautious about where he took his car for repairs. He didn't trust just anyone to take care of his vehicle. That's why he was counting on Joseph's expertise to get his car back in optimal condition as smoothly and quickly as possible. As he waited, Donald struck up a conversation with another client in the waiting area. They exchanged stories about their cars and discussed the exemplary service they both had experienced at Joseph's shop. It was obvious that Joseph's hard work and dedication to customer service had left a lasting impression on the community. In the garage, Joseph meticulously worked on Donald's car, carefully diagnosing the issue. After closely examining the engine and various parts of the vehicle, Joseph discovered that a few belts and hoses were worn out and needed to be replaced. It was a relatively straightforward fix, but he made sure to double-check his work to avoid any future complications. Once the repair was completed, Joseph called Donald into the garage to explain the work he had done and to reassure him that his car was now running smoothly. He also provided suggestions on how Donald could maintain his vehicle better to prevent similar issues from arising in the future. Donald was impressed with Joseph's professionalism and was grateful for the effort he had put into fixing his car. After settling the bill, he shook Joseph's hand and thanked him for a job well done. As he drove away from the auto repair shop, Donald couldn't have been more satisfied with the service he had received. He knew that he had made the right choice in trusting Joseph with his car and that he would return to the shop for any future repairs. In the meantime, Joseph cleaned up the garage and prepared for his next client. He took immense pride in his work and knew that customer satisfaction was his top priority. No matter who walked into his shop, Joseph was determined to provide the highest level of service and expertise to ensure that each client left feeling confident and well-cared for. This is the story of Joseph, the exceptional mechanic, and Donald, the satisfied client. Their interaction exemplified the importance of trust, hard work, and providing excellent service, traits that continue to serve Joseph well as he carries on his father's legacy and remains a respected figure in his community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The cubs were born in zoos in China and removed from their mothers when they were three months old.Their first home in South Africa was a one-acre camp where they stayed for a month.Their next home was a ten acre area,where they lived for three months to help them gradually get used to life outside a cage. When the cubs first arrived in South Africa,they didn't even want to leave their cages.It took weeks to get them to eat chicken,used as they were to being fed beef at the Zoo in China where they were born.It took months of practice to hunt a live animal and then make the link between the kill and food.Now just a few months on,and living in a 150-acre camp,they have become remarkably skilled hunters.

Harkness, who admired the social intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at Yale and Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a master and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as \\"Master's Teas,\\" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. Instead, all undergraduate courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college. What is the answer to this question: Who runs Yale's residential colleges?","completion":"The residential colleges at Yale are run by a master and an academic dean according to the article. These individuals live in the college, and the college's fellowship is composed of university faculty and affiliates. Here's my reasoning: 1. After reading the user's question, I understand that they are asking for information about the management of Yale's residential colleges. 2. I examined the given article and found a relevant passage, \\"The colleges are led by a master and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each college's fellowship.\\" 3. From the above line, it is clear that the residential colleges are managed by two official roles, a master and an academic dean. The academic dean and master actually reside in the college, indicating their direct involvement in the functioning and management of the college. 4. Furthermore, the fellowship of each college, which can be seen as its academic community, is composed of university faculty and affiliates. This suggests that these individuals also play a role in the running of the college. So, considering all this, the answer to the question \\"Who runs Yale's residential colleges?\\" would be 'a master, an academic dean, and a fellowship composed of university faculty and affiliates'."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. One look at Fred Rooney, and you just know he's the good guy. A trace of childish innocence in his face gives the lanky Bethlehem lawyer a Jimmy Stewart-like quality of quiet trust. In black jeans and button-down shirt, he's a kind of folk hero in the south Bethlehem melting pot where he's crafted a law practice catering to working-class families - mostly Latino - in the shadow of the hulkish remnants of Bethlehem Steel. A two-hour drive away, at City University of New York Law School in Queens, Rooney spends several days a week helping upstart lawyers develop storefront practices that, like his, provide legal representation to folks who can't afford a 250-an-hour legal counselor. Kristin Booth Glen, the law school's dean, took one look at Rooney and knew he was the right person to head the innovative Community Legal Resources Network. ''Fred's so low-key, he's Midwestern in effect,'' says Glen, a former New York Supreme Court judge. ''He captivates people, he inspires loyalty.'' For bringing legal representation to the poor and a host of other social causes, including finding medical care for seriously ill children in Latin America, the Moravian College Alumni Association has chosen Rooney for its prestigious Haupert Humanitarian Award. The award, given to only a select few alumni, will be presented at 7:30 tonight at a reception on Moravian's Priscilla Payne Hurd campus. Moravian, where he was an undergraduate in the early 1970s, inspired Rooney's deep sense of social justice. The son of a Bethlehem Steel executive in New York, he came to the Bethlehem campus from an affluent upbringing on Long Island. The young Rooney might have set his sights on Washington, D.C., like his uncle, former U.S. Rep. Fred Rooney of Bethlehem. After all, politics run in the Rooney family. His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party. But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined. ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled. ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.'' After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.

Let's solve it step by step. Step 1: Let the number be \\"x\\". Step 2: According to the problem, the difference between the number and its two-fifth is 510. So, x - (2/5)x = 510 Step 3: Solve for x. To do this, first combine the terms with the variable x: x - (2/5)x = (5/5)x - (2/5)x = (3/5)x Step 4: Now our equation looks like this: (3/5)x = 510 Step 5: Isolate the variable x by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of 3/5, which is 5/3: (5/3) * (3/5)x = 510 * (5/3) Step 6: Simplify the equation: x = 850 Step 7: Now that we have found the value of x, let's find 12% of it. To do this, multiply x by 12% or 0.12: 0.12 * 850 = 102 Student: The 12% of that number is 102."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By wide margins, voters agreed that the measure would have closed loopholes that allow gun buyers to avoid background checks, and rejected the argument that the amendment would have unfairly targeted gun enthusiasts. Overall, however, most voters were unsure of how they felt about Toomey's overall handling of gun control: Thirty-seven percent didn't have a decisive answer, while 34 percent approved. The rest, 29 percent, disapproved.* The poll's results do indicate that, while supporting the expansion of background checks, Pennsylvania voters doubt such legislation will actually become law. When asked whether they think President Obama will be able to get a background checks law like Manchin-Toomey passed in Congress before he's out of office, 60 percent of voters in the state said no. Read the full results here. ||||| WASHINGTON — Talks to revive gun control legislation are quietly under way on Capitol Hill as a bipartisan group of senators seeks a way to bridge the differences that led to last week’s collapse of the most serious effort to overhaul the country’s gun laws in 20 years. Drawing on the lessons from battles in the 1980s and ’90s over the Brady Bill, which failed in Congress several times before ultimately passing, gun control supporters believe they can prevail by working on a two-pronged strategy. First, they are identifying senators who might be willing to change their votes and support a background check system with fewer loopholes. Second, they are looking to build a national campaign that would better harness overwhelming public support for universal background checks — which many national polls put at near 90 percent approval — to pressure lawmakers. Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, have been talking in recent days about how they could persuade more senators to support their bill to expand background checks for gun buyers, which drew backing from only four Republicans last week. “We’re going to work it hard,” Mr. Manchin said Thursday, adding that he was looking at tweaking the language of his bill in a way that he believed would satisfy senators who, for example, felt that background checks on person-to-person gun sales would be too onerous for people who live in rural areas far from a sporting goods store. Those concerns were an issue for Alaska’s senators, Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, and Mark Begich, a Democrat. Meanwhile, a separate gun measure, an anti-trafficking bill, is the subject of talks between Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and two Republican senators who voted no on the background check bill. The Republicans, Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, are discussing ways they might support the bill, which would criminalize the shipping or transfer of guns to someone who is barred from possessing a firearm. While the bill on its own falls short of what the families of victims of mass shootings have been pushing Congress to enact — and is therefore less controversial — some Democrats believe it could be a good starting point to build a broader bipartisan compromise. “I think trafficking can be the base of the bill, the rock on which everything else stands,” Ms. Gillibrand said. “I also think it’s complementary to background checks because, let’s be honest, criminals aren’t going to buy a gun and go through a background check. So if you really want to go after criminals, you have to have to do both.” Ms. Ayotte said Thursday that she would continue talking with Ms. Gillibrand and was confident that some areas of agreement, on areas like expanding mental health care, could be reached. “There’s a lot we have agreement on in terms of enforcing our current system,” she said. “And so I certainly think we should look for the common elements, including the mental health piece, which I support as well, and try to move as much of that as possible forward.” Ms. Ayotte — the only one out of 22 senators on the East Coast north of Virginia who voted against strengthening background checks — has been the target lately of some of the most furious lobbying by gun control proponents, who have inundated local newspapers with letters to the editor denouncing her vote, run radio ads saying she “ignored the will of the people” and swamped her office with phone calls. On Thursday, two receptionists placed one call after another on hold as they politely listened to callers vent and replied, “Thank you for your message.” Next week when Congress is in recess, gun control groups coordinating with the Obama committee Organizing for Action will be fanning out across the country in dozens of demonstrations at the offices of senators who voted down the background check bill. As talks moved ahead on Capitol Hill, the White House was pressing on with its own efforts. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. summoned a group of gun control proponents to his office on Thursday — including representatives from Michael R. Bloomberg’s Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Gabrielle Giffords’s Americans for Responsible Solutions and the Brady Campaign to End Gun Violence — and reassured them that the issue had become his highest priority. The vice president recalled the long struggle to enact the Brady Bill, which established a five-day waiting period to buy a gun. And he told them gun control would become his new campaign to end the Iraq war, according to two participants in the meeting, comparing it to the issue he devoted much of his energy to during President Obama’s first term. The pressure campaign is evidently already starting to take its toll, the vice president added, because several senators have confided to him that they are feeling the backlash from constituents. Those senators, he added, told him that they needed to be assured there was adequate support for expanded gun control to pass because they did not want to take such a great political risk on something that was doomed to fail. And some of them are already beginning to ask about what tweaks gun control proponents might entertain that could make the bills more palatable, the vice president said. “It’s not a question of really changing their minds for or against this policy,” one of the meeting’s participants said. “It’s demonstrating that it’s safe to do the right thing and politically unsafe not to.” |||||Summary:","completion":"The failed Manchin-Toomey gun control compromise has led to Republican Sen.

Write an article based on this \\"Schedule routine checkups to ensure your sexual health. Practice safe sex. Alert any sexual partners to your infection.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Prioritizing Sexual Health: The Importance of Routine Checkups and Safe Practices Introduction Sexual health is a crucial aspect of an individual's overall well-being, and maintaining it should be at the forefront of everyone's minds. Regular checkups, practicing safe sex, and open communication with partners are essential steps in ensuring optimal sexual health. In this article, we will discuss the importance of prioritizing these practices and explore the benefits and reasons behind them. Routine Checkup: An Investment in Sexual Health Step 1: Understand the significance of routine checkups Investing time and effort in regular medical checkups for sexual health plays a pivotal role in early detection and prevention of various sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and diseases. By identifying any issues early, individuals can receive the necessary treatment, reduce the risk of complications, and improve their overall well-being. Step 2: Familiarize oneself with the testing process Routine checkups usually involve screening tests and physical examinations, which are crucial in understanding one's sexual health status. Depending on age, gender, and sexual history, healthcare professionals recommend personalized testing schedules to ensure that individuals receive the most effective and appropriate care. Step 3: Be proactive and consistent in scheduling checkups Proactively scheduling routine checkups shows a genuine commitment to one's sexual health. Maintaining a consistent schedule allows individuals to stay informed about their status, act responsibly with sexual partners, and stay abreast of new developments in sexual health care. Safe Sex: Prevention is Better than Cure Step 1: Understand the necessity of safe sex practices Practicing safe sex involves engaging in behaviors that minimize the risk of contracting or transmitting STIs or unintended pregnancies. By wearing appropriate protection, such as condoms and dental dams, and using contraceptives, individuals can enjoy a healthy and fulfilling sexual life. Step 2: Educate oneself on different protection methods As an active participant in maintaining sexual health, it is essential to learn about the various contraceptive methods, their correct usage, and effectiveness. This knowledge empowers individuals to make informed decisions on the best course of action for their personal circumstances. Step 3: Foster mutual understanding with partners Discussing sexual health and safe sex practices with partners is key in building trust and understanding. This open communication helps establish boundaries and ensures both parties are on the same page regarding safety, comfort, and preferences. Communication: Transparency and Shared Responsibility Step 1: Embrace honesty and openness If an individual is diagnosed with an STI, honesty and transparency are critical. By alerting sexual partners to the infection, individuals take a responsible step towards safeguarding their partner's health and preventing further spread of the infection. Step 2: Communicate without fear Having an open conversation about sexual health status may feel daunting; however, approaching the topic respectfully and sensitively can create a supportive environment. This encourages partners to share information, prioritize their sexual health, and contribute to reducing the stigma surrounding STIs. Step 3: Encourage a culture of shared responsibility When both partners actively engage and take responsibility for their sexual health, it forms a culture of mutual respect and shared accountability. This environment lays the foundation for a healthy and trust-filled relationship. Conclusion Sexual health is an integral component of overall well-being. Prioritizing routine checkups, safe sex, and open communication with partners can efficiently protect and maintain one's sexual health. By staying proactive and committed to these practices, individuals can contribute to a healthier society, promote responsible behavior, and enjoy fulfilling relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This article: Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene, a braided river system called the \\"Ancestral Rogue River\\" flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved. For about 2.1 million years, the river deposited what is now known as the Payne Cliffs Formation by laying down a thin conglomerate, followed by arkosic sandstone and siltstone. Between 10 and 20 million years ago, the uplift that created the nearby Klamath Mountains caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley. Vertical erosion, or downcutting of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about 690 feet (210 m) of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.Approximately seven million years ago in the upper Miocene, a 44-mile (71 km) long trachyandesitic lava flow that likely came from Olson Mountain near present-day Lost Creek Lake flowed down the Ancestral Rogue River and its tributaries and spread throughout the valley. This lava formed a hard cap over the Payne Cliffs Formation. At Lost Creek Lake, the lava attained its maximum thickness of 730 feet (220 m) and thinned to about 100 to 200 feet (30 to 61 m) to the north of Medford. Since the Olson eruption, the Rogue River has eroded 90 percent of the solidified lava. Though the andesite prevented much erosion to the caps of the Table Rocks, the andesite-capped cliffs eroded from the side as the softer sedimentary units of the Payne Cliffs Formation gave way. This erosion created expansive talus fields which surround the plateaus on all sides, creating slopes capable of supporting abundant plant and animal life. Upper and Lower Table Rock both stand 800 feet (240 m) above the valley floor, and just over 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level. There are approximately 300 acres (120 ha) of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and 500 acres (200 ha) on Upper Table Rock.The Table Rocks offer an example of inverted relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion... contains an answer for the question: What is there 500 acres of on Upper Table Rock?, what is it ? The answer is:","completion":"There are approximately 500 acres of level ground on Upper Table Rock. Here's my step-by-step reasoning: 1.

Translate to Russian: - Are you surprised by the latest results in the Ukraine Premier League? Russian:","completion":"To translate the sentence \\"Are you surprised by the latest results in the Ukraine Premier League?\\" to Russian, it's essential to consider the proper words and grammar for each element in the sentence to express the same idea in the target language. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the translation process: 1. The first element in the sentence is the question word \\"Are you surprised.\\" In Russian, this can be translated as \\"Вы удивлены\\" (Vy udivleny), where \\"Вы\\" means \\"you\\" and \\"удивлены\\" means \\"surprised.\\" 2. The next element is the preposition \\"by.\\" In Russian, we can use the preposition \\"последними\\" (poslednimi), which means \\"by the latest\\" when combined with the following word \\"results.\\" 3. The word \\"results\\" can be translated as \\"результатами\\" (rezultatami) in Russian. 4. The preposition \\"in\\" can be translated as \\"в\\" (v) in Russian. 5. The words \\"Ukraine Premier League\\" can be translated as \\"Украинской Премьер-лиге\\" (Ukrainskoy Prem'er-lige). Here, the translation retains the term \\"Премьер-лига\\" (Premier League) while adjusting the word \\"Ukraine\\" to its Russian equivalent, \\"Украина\\" (Ukraina).

(Las Vegas Review-Journal) Art Bell He was awake when most of the country was asleep, cultivating a loyal following while sharing his fascination with the unexplained on his nighttime paranormal-themed show. For the better part of two decades, longtime late-night radio personality Art Bell was his own producer, engineer and host of his show, “Coast to Coast AM.” He later launched his own satellite radio program from his Pahrump home after retiring from full-time hosting duties in 2003. On the airwaves, Bell captivated listeners with his fascination for the unexplained, such as UFOs, alien abductions and crop circles. He died Friday at his home at the age of 72. “As he begins his journey on the ‘other side,’ we take solace in the hope that he is now finding out all of the answers to the mysteries he pursued for so many nights with all of us,” Coast to Coast said in a statement Saturday. Coast to Coast was syndicated nationwide on about 500 stations across the United States and Canada in the 1990s before he left in 2002. He broadcast the show from Pahrump’s KNYE 95.1 FM, a station he founded. Lorraine Rotundo Steele, who had been listening to Bell for more than 21 years, said Saturday that she was stunned by the news of her favorite radio host’s death. The 60-year-old Canada resident started tuning in to Bell’s show after her dad died. “Art taught me how to keep an open mind,” she told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “At a very dark time in my life, he kept me sane. Art’s fascination with life after death was what I needed after losing my father.” Bell’s show had a huge national following in part because he played to people’s imaginations, “like a Disneyland for sci-fi,” local talk show radio host Alan Stock said. He remembered Bell as a creative, unique, nice man who will undoubtedly live on as a radio icon. “Nobody talked about Area 51, and about chupacabras and about aliens,” Stock said Saturday night. “And he talked about that on a regular basis.” His show, popular with truckers and others awake in the wee hours of the day, offered a look into a world nobody else on the radio had touched, Stock said. Stock recalled listening to his show early one morning in the 90s. A caller into Bell’s show said he was piloting a small plane toward Area 51 — the classified Air Force facility located about 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas — to find out “what’s really going on.” “And Art said, ‘Don’t do it, they will shoot you down,’” Stock said. Bell and the caller went back and forth for about an hour and 20 minutes, he said, until the man reported seeing military planes flying behind him, signaling him to ground the plane. Despite Bell’s insistence on the man obeying their commands, the caller said he would keep flying. “The next thing you know, it went dead and you heard nothing at all,” Stock said. Stock had Bell on his show about two weeks later, and he asked Bell what happened to the caller. Bell said he never heard from the man again. Bell retired several times in his career, which included a short-lived show on SiriusXM satellite radio in 2013. He also co-authored a book, “The Coming Global Superstorm,” with Whitley Strieber. Returning to terrestrial radio afterward was not a difficult decision, he told the Pahrump Valley Times in August 2013. “That’s easy, because I love it,” he said at the time. “It’s my life, and that’s all I have ever done. I went through a lot of family problems, so that interrupted things, and I was overseas for four years, and that certainly interrupted things. I went back into radio because I love it.” Pioneering broadcaster Bell was inducted into the Nevada Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame in 2006 and into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2008, the same year he sold KNYE to Karen Jackson. Bell’s genuine interest in the topics he discussed contributed to the interest and entertainment his show generated, she said in a press release to the Review-Journal. “Art was a pioneer in broadcasting taking overnight talk radio to new heights which generated huge audiences,” Jackson said. “He was a master at creating spell binding, intriguing, sometimes frightening and thoroughly compelling talk radio.” “No one has been more loved by their family, friends and listening audience,” she said. For a time, Bell also held the Guinness world record for a solo broadcast marathon, logging more than 115 hours of airtime while working as a DJ in Okinawa, Japan. The stunt raised funds to rescue over 100 Vietnamese orphans left stranded by the conflict in their country, according to Coast to Coast. An early love for radio Bell was born in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on June 17, 1945. The only child in a military family, he moved around a lot as a kid. He later served in the the Air Force as a medic during the Vietnam War, but his love for radio was always there. According to Coast to Coast AM, he was an FCC licensed radio technician at age 13, and while in the Air Force, he created an on-base pirate radio station that played anti-war music. It wasn’t until the mid-1980s, when he returned to the United States and joined KDWN-AM in Las Vegas, that talk radio captivated Bell. There, he mastered his famous blend of contemporary and unsettling. “I want to bring topics on radio you otherwise might not hear,” Bell, then 50, told the Pahrump Valley Times in January 1996. His cause of death has not yet been determined. Bell’s autopsy is scheduled for later this week, according to the Nye County Sheriff’s Office. Bell leaves behind his wife, Airyn, whom he married in 2006, and his children Asia, Alex and Art Bell IV. He is preceded in death by his parents, Jackson said.

He served as his own producer, engineer and host, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Fans, including celebrities like William Shatner and singer Josh Groban, took to Twitter to praise Bell.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

Loop through the given list's items. 3. At each iteration, check if the current item is a numerical string by trying to convert the string to a number (using a try/except block to catch any ValueErrors that would occur if the conversion fails). If the conversion is successful, add the current position to the list of positions. 4. After the loop, check if the list of positions is empty. If it is, return -1 to indicate that no numerical elements were found. Otherwise, return the list of positions. Let's start: 1. Initialize \`num_positions\` as an empty list to store the positions of numerical elements. 2. For each \`item\` at position \`i\` in the input list: 2.1. Try to convert \`item\` to an integer. If a ValueError occurs, this means that the \`item\` is not a numerical string, so we don't need to do anything and can proceed with the next \`item\`. 2.2. If no error occurs, add \`i+1\` to \`num_positions\` because we are considering the 1st index as 1 not 0. 3. If \`num_positions\` is empty after the loop, return -1 as required. Otherwise, return the list \`num_positions\`. This sequence of steps will accurately identify the positions of all numerical elements in the list and return them in the correct format.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. One thing I'm sure everyone who has seen this film will agree on is that it is very creepy. The other films in Polanski's unofficial trilogy are creepy too, but they are all different in what makes them creepy, but they all roughly deal with the same thing, they all deal with the mind. Definitely the staring people are very creepy, each of them sent shivers down my spine that made me incapable of sitting still. Again, if you have seen the other two films mentioned, I'm sure you'll find this quite creepy, because you begin to expect typical Polanski traits that you think you have caught onto, he is aware of this and will keep teasing you with simple things, personally every time Trelkovsky would slowly turn around I would be bracing myself for a jump, maybe that's just me, but it felt intended to do that, though it was quite subtle, there is no build up of the music in those moments. The acting in this was pretty good, mostly that from Polanski of course, the other characters in the film don't have all that much time to outshine the lead. Polanski really proves himself as an all-round great filmmaker, he not only can direct and write great films, but he can actually act too. I don't think there is any other better person who could have pulled off the Trelkovsky character, Polanski settled right on in perfectly. I like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast, to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent, which I respect greatly. One thing I didn't like about this film is how it was done in English. For those who don't know, this is a French film, American financed, and as well to make it more commercially successful it was mostly done in English. There are parts which it is very obvious there has been dubbing, and I don't know why it is, but 3/4 of the time when there is a dub they get the complete wrong person to do the dub. There is a women in the film who when she speaks it's obvious it's a dub, but they got the most annoying person to do the voice-over, it was seriously pain to my ears to hear her speak, she had the loudest high pitch voice I've heard in a while, it almost seemed fake, but I don't see what the point was, she was a rather small character. I honestly would of preferred if they just left it as it was filmed, parts of it in French and parts of it in English, because the dubbing in this film was a pain and was not near (two completely different films, I know) the high standard of another film that did a similar thing, which was, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I realise it's not a big problem, just when you do realise it, it gets annoying, but I'm sure you won't sit there the long trying to lip read what they are actually saying, regardless if you know French. Whats so great about Polanski is that he will let you think you know him, that you know his style, which in some aspects you do, but really, you can't see whats behind that corner. This film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned, which I think really strengthens this one in particular. I personally feel this is the best of the three, I'm unsure which comes next, but they are all relatively close in their level of greatness. The ending is fantastic, it is so easy to dwindle on it for a long time to come and get nowhere. I choose not to think to much on it, just to have my personal opinion and leave it at that. I've rambled on, and I haven't really given any insight on what makes this film so great, I don't think, so I'll quickly do it here. If you liked Repulsion and/or Rosemary's Baby, I guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least. For those who are too unfortunate to have seen either then I recommend you check this film out if your looking for something that is quite a creepy film that is quite intelligent, particularly the end, as well if your looking for something that deals with the mind, paranoia even, though that is better fitted under Repulsion.

The reviewer clearly expresses their appreciation for the excellent acting, especially from Polanski, the recurring theme of dealing with the mind in the unofficial trilogy, and the unpredictability of Polanski's style. They also mention how the film is open to interpretation, adding strength to it, and praise the fantastic ending. While they have some criticisms regarding the use of English and dubbing, overall, their review of the film is positive. They also ensure to recommend the film to those who enjoyed Polanski's other works, as well as those looking for a creepy and intelligent film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In fact, I think the home my dad bought in 1955 might have been the very home that served as the development office mentioned in one of the stories. I didn't live in Carmelas, but I played there with friends, visited some of their homes, attended their birthday parties, fell for their sisters, bought candy at the Mexican Store, and even pulled a little red wagon down those dusty streets selling newspapers on Sunday morning when I was five years old.And still, I knew very little about their history, and their beliefs.

Article: As more and more books become movie adaptations , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button. Question: According to the text, it seems that the CCSS _ . Options: A: prevents students watching movies B: provides students with well-known movies C: encourages students to write novels D: provides guidance on teaching and learning Answer:","completion":"D: provides guidance on teaching and learning"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His 30's A:","completion":"Title: Beyond Time's Reach Genre: Drama, Thriller, Mystery Plot: In a quaint, picturesque town in northern India, lives a brilliant mathematician and scientist, Dr. Ranjeet Khurana. Dr. Khurana, in his mid-30's, has spent most of his life working on a top-secret government project. However, his family and ordinary townsfolk are oblivious to this aspect of his life, knowing him only as a warm and helpful chemistry teacher at the local high school. Dr. Khurana's life takes a sudden turn when he discovers an unusual stone with unearthly properties while on a family picnic. Enthralled by the stone's unique capabilities, Ranjeet takes it back to his home and begins investigating it, unknowingly uncovering its connection to his past, present, and future. As he delves deeper into understanding the complexities around the stone, Ranjeet stumbles upon the fact that it isn't merely a historical artifact, but a portal to the past. Excited by the implications and possibilities, Ranjeet cautiously ventures back in time to revisit episodes from his youth, including the tragic death of his childhood best friend, Vikas, and the heartbreak he experienced when his first love, Naina, moved away. Intrigued by the portal's possibilities, a much younger Dr. Khurana, still in his teenage years, decides to delve into the future and finds himself face-to-face with his present-day self. This encounter creates a generational loop amongst the various ages of Ranjeet – teenage, present-day and even an older version in his 60's – compelling them to work together to solve an impending disaster that threatens to unravel the fabric of time and space. Dealing with their own personal struggles and bearing the burden of saving the world, the three versions of Ranjeet – each with their unique perspectives and experiences – form an unbreakable bond that transcends age, realizing that it isn't just about averting the disaster; it's about the choices they made in life and the significance of their relationships. In the present time, older Ranjeet ensures that current Ranjeet uses the stone to prevent the tragedy involving Vikas by presenting himself just in the nick of time. Meanwhile, present-day Ranjeet tracks down Naina and brings closure to their love story by ensuring her successful and happy life. Through a series of trials and tribulations, the familial circle becomes complete once again. However, the cost of altering the past begins to manifest, as the town experiences strange and inexplicable occurrences. Realizing that their actions have resulted in dire consequences, the trio decides to use the stone one last time to reunite and undo their transgressions. In the process, they destroy the stone to prevent any further disruptions to the timeline, but, unfortunately, this means that their bond and the heartwarming moments they experienced together will be locked away in a forgotten corner of time. In the end, Dr. Ranjeet Khurana is no longer the man he was. He cannot remember the unique camaraderie he shared with his younger and older selves, but he knows that he made a difference – not just to the ones he loved but also to the world at large. The movie culminates with the older Ranjeet passing away peacefully, surrounded by family, as the camera pans out to a park bench where the three versions of Ranjeet have etched their names – a subtle reminder that beyond time's reach, they were brothers across ages, bound by destiny, and truly unforgettable."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given a scientific passage and an answer, generate a question for the given answer. Passage: One major factor that limits the length of food chains is energy. Energy is lost as heat between each trophic level due to the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, after a limited number of trophic energy transfers, the amount of energy remaining in the food chain may not be great enough to support viable populations at yet a higher trophic level. The loss of energy between trophic levels is illustrated by the pioneering studies of Howard T. Odum in the Silver Springs, Florida, ecosystem in the 1940s (Figure 46.5). The primary producers generated 20,819 kcal/m2/yr (kilocalories per square meter per year), the primary consumers generated 3368 kcal/m2/yr, the secondary consumers generated 383 kcal/m2/yr, and the tertiary consumers only generated 21 kcal/m2/yr.

Question: What do the Lombardic mandolins resemble more than modern mandolins? Is \\"These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins.\\" the correct answer? Choose from: i. yes. ii. no.","completion":"ii. no. The Lombardic mandolins differ considerably from modern mandolins in their structure, materials, and sound. These historical mandolins, which originated in Italy, do share similarities with the mandolino and the mandore. However, the statement \\"These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins.\\" does not fully capture the unique features and characteristics of Lombardic mandolins. The Lombardic mandolins, also known as Milanese mandolins, were larger and more ornate than their modern counterparts. With a distinctively shaped body resembling a pear or teardrop, these mandolins had a longer string length and a wider fingerboard. Unlike some modern mandolins, which use metal frets, Lombardic mandolins had tie-on gut frets on their necks, giving them a softer, more delicate sound. The mandolino, a small, flat-backed stringed instrument similar in appearance to a tiny lute, was an important predecessor of the modern mandolin. It had an elongated body, which differed from the larger body of the Lombardic mandolin, and was known for its high-pitched sound and rapid playing technique. While both instruments have a common historic origin, they also have distinct features that set them apart. The mandore, another early stringed instrument with ties to the mandolin family, was especially popular in the Renaissance period. Similarly to the Lombardic mandolin and mandolino, it featured gut frets on its neck, but it had a round back and a slightly different string count and tuning. Although it shares some common features with the Lombardic mandolin, such as its elaborate design and fretting method, the two instruments remain distinct in their own ways. In conclusion, it would be more accurate to say that the Lombardic mandolins have strong historical connections to both the mandolino and the mandore, but they exhibit their own unique design and tonal characteristics that set them apart from modern mandolins."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - jar - cup - drinking glass - container - tankard The answer to this question is:","completion":"James most likely used a drinking glass to hold the liquid. While all of the options presented could potentially be used to hold liquid, the most common and sensible option for everyday use is a drinking glass. Drinking glasses are specifically designed for holding and consuming liquids, making them the most practical and convenient choice. A jar, container, or tankard may also be used for holding liquid, but they are not as commonly used for everyday drinking as a glass. Jars and containers are often used for storing or preserving food items and may not be the most comfortable or hygienic options for drinking directly. Tankards, though used for drinking, are more associated with drinking alcohol in a historical context or in specific establishments and are not as widely used as drinking glasses. A cup could be used for drinking as well, but the term \\"cup\\" can refer to a variety of shapes and sizes, including coffee cups, teacups, and disposable cups. Cups can be made of different materials like ceramic, plastic, paper, or even glass, which may also affect their suitability for holding a particular type of liquid. Drinking glasses, on the other hand, are designed for a range of commonly consumed liquids and are typically made of glass, making them a more universally suitable option. In summary, considering common sense, the most likely option for James to hold and consume a liquid is a drinking glass.

Q: Following up from my recent blog post explaining why dietary supplements offer few benefits for most people, new research has found that people who take a mineral supplement actually consume more minerals from their normal diet than non-supplement users. The notion of the ‘worried well’ is certainly alive and kicking. Vitamin and mineral supplements are big business. Reported figures in Australia suggest that 27% of women and 15% of men take some form of supplement with vitamin C, B complex, multivitamins, vitamin E and calcium all being popular choices. Contrary to the rationale for needing supplements in the first place, people who take supplements are more likely to be healthier than people who don’t take supplements. Supplement users also tend to be leaner, smoke less, exercise more, and eat more fruit and vegetables. While it may seem obvious that people who take supplements likely consume more nutrients from their regular diet to start with, this hasn’t been well studied in large population groups. Using data from a nationally representative government health survey, researchers from the United States looked at the mineral intake from food and supplements of over 8000 men and women between 2003 and 2006. The results were clear cut: people taking mineral supplements were consuming more minerals from their normal diet than those who didn’t take supplements. The observation was even stronger in women than in men. The eight most popular mineral supplements taken were calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, copper, potassium and selenium. Proving that it is possible to have too much of a good thing, supplement users were more likely to be exceeding the recommended upper level of intake for magnesium, zinc, iron and calcium. For someone who believes that they are reasonably healthy and are conscious of what they eat most of the time, taking a mineral supplement ‘just in case’ offers little to no benefit. Question: What are the minerals that supplement users are likely to be exceeding the upper limit? === The answer to the above question is Options: I. magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium II. selenium, calcium, iron, copper III. not enough information IV. calcium, iron, phosphorus, copper A:","completion":"I. magnesium, zinc, iron, and calcium"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. Question: Where is Camp Humphreys located?

The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea? , can you please find it? Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

EU:lla ja komissiolla on monia mahdollisuuksia vaikuttaa positiivisesti kansalaistensa elämään ja tehdä enemmän nykyisten haasteiden kohtaamiseen. Tässä on joitakin ehdotuksia siitä, kuinka ne voivat parantaa toimintaansa ja toimenpiteitään: 1. Voimakkaampi ilmastonmuutoksen torjunta: EU ja komissio voivat lisätä ponnistelujaan ilmastonmuutoksen torjumiseksi esimerkiksi asettamalla kunnianhimoisempia päästövähennystavoitteita, parantamalla EU:n energiatehokkuutta ja tukemalla jäsenmaiden investointeja uusiutuvaan energiaan. 2. Talouskasvun edistäminen: Eurooppalaisen talouskasvun edistämiseksi EU ja komissio voisivat esimerkiksi kehittää tukiohjelmia pienyrityksille ja innovaatioille, edistää koulutusta ja ammattitaitoa sekä kehittää Euroopan sisämarkkinoita. 3. Sosiaalisen yhteenkuuluvuuden parantaminen: Euroopan unioni voi vahvistaa yhteiskuntien yhteenkuuluvuutta tukemalla työllisyyttä, tasa-arvoa, koulutusta ja sosiaaliturvaa koskevia ohjelmia. Näihin toimiin voi kuulua esimerkiksi työttömyystuen uudelleenjärjestäminen, vaikeasti työllistyvien ryhmien työllistymisen edistäminen ja koulutusmahdollisuuksien lisääminen. 4. Vahvempi yhteinen ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikka: EU ja komissio voivat yhdessä kehittää yhteistä ulko- ja turvallisuuspolitiikkaa; tämä voi käytännössä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi yhteisten diplomaattisten toimien ja sotilaallisen yhteistyön vahvistamista sekä yhteistyön lisäämistä kansainvälisen terrorismin ja katastrofien torjumiseksi. 5. Aktiivisempi rooli globaaleissa kysymyksissä: EU ja komissio voivat omaksua aktiivisemman roolin globaalissa toiminnassa, esimerkiksi puolustamalla ihmisoikeuksia ja demokratiaa, edistämällä kestävää kehitystä, harjoittamalla aktiivista taistelua köyhyyttä ja eriarvoisuutta vastaan sekä tukemalla tehokasta monenvälisyyspolitiikkaa. 6. Unionin demokraattisuuden vahvistaminen: Euroopan parlamentin vaaleilla valittujen edustajien vallan kasvattamisella ja Euroopan komission jäsenten demokraattisen vastuun lisäämisellä voidaan vahvistaa Euroopan unionin demokraattisuutta ja kansalaistensa luottamusta EU:n toimintaan. 7. Kansalaisten osallistumisen parantaminen: EU:n on pyrittävä parantamaan kansalaistensa osallistumista ja kuuntelemaan heitä tehokkaammin. Osallistumisen lisääminen voi tarkoittaa esimerkiksi avoimemman päätöksenteon edistämistä ja laajempaa julkista keskustelua, joka johtaa paremmin perusteltuihin poliittisiin ratkaisuihin.

They constitute one of the major groups into which the flowering plants have traditionally been divided, the rest of the flowering plants having two cotyledons and therefore classified as dicotyledons, or dicots. However, molecular phylogenetic research has shown that while the monocots form a monophyletic group or clade (comprising all the descendants of a common ancestor), the dicots do not. Monocots have almost always been recognized as a group, but with various taxonomic ranks and under several different names. The APG III system of 2009 recognises a clade called \\"monocots\\" but does not assign it to a taxonomic rank. - The dicotyledons, also known as dicots (or more rarely dicotyls), were one of the two groups into which all the flowering plants or angiosperms were formerly divided. The name refers to one of the typical characteristics of the group, namely that the seed has two embryonic leaves or cotyledons. There are around 200,000 species within this group. The other group of flowering plants were called monocotyledons or monocots, typically having one cotyledon. Historically, these two groups formed the two divisions of the flowering plants. - The Cronquist system is a taxonomic classification system of flowering plants. It was developed by Arthur Cronquist in his texts \\"An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants\\" (1981) and \\"The Evolution and Classification of Flowering Plants\\" (1968; 2nd edition, 1988). Cronquist's system places flowering plants into two broad classes, Magnoliopsida (dicotyledons) and Liliopsida (monocotyledons). Within these classes, related orders are grouped into subclasses. While the scheme was widely used, in either the original form or in adapted versions, many botanists now use the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants, first developed in 1998. The system as laid out in Cronquist's \\"An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants\\" (1981) counts 64 orders and 321 families in class Magnoliopsida and 19 orders and 65 families in class Liliopsida. - Magnoliopsida is a valid botanical name for a class of flowering plants. By definition the class will include the family Magnoliaceae, but its circumscription can otherwise vary, being more inclusive or less inclusive depending upon the classification system being discussed. - Arthur John Cronquist (March 19, 1919 March 22, 1992) was a United States biologist, botanist and a specialist on Compositae. He is considered one of the most influential botanists of the 20th century, largely due to his formulation of the Cronquist system. Two plant genera in the aster family have been named in his honor. These are \\"Cronquistia\\", a possible synonym of \\"Carphochaete\\", and \\"Cronquistianthus\\", which is sometimes included as a group within \\"Eupatorium\\". The former was applied by R.M. King and the latter by him and Harold E. Robinson. - Mistletoe is the common name for most obligate hemiparasitic plants in the order Santalales. Mistletoes attach to and penetrate the branches of a tree or shrub by a structure called the haustorium, through which they absorb water and nutrients from the host plant. - Liliopsida (synonym: Liliatae) is a botanical name for the class containing the family Liliaceae (or Lily Family). It is considered synonymous (or nearly synonymous) with the name monocotyledon. Publication of the name is credited to Scopoli (in 1760): see author citation (botany). This name is formed by replacing the termination \\"-aceae\\" in the name Liliaceae by the termination \\"-opsida\\" (Art 16 of the ICBN). - The Viscaceae are a family of flowering plants . In past decades , several systems of plant taxonomy recognized this family , notably the 1981 Cronquist system . In this circumscription , the family includes the several genera of mistletoes . However , the APG II system of 2003 does not recognize the family , treating it as a synonym of Santalaceae . Genera once treated as belonging to family Viscaceae include : Arceuthobium Dendrophthora Ginalloa Korthalsella Notothixos Phoradendron Viscum Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'parent taxon' with the subject 'viscaceae'.

The scenario involves PersonX as the subject and may also involve other participants, referred to generically (e.g., PersonY, PersonZ). Specific people's names have been replaced to maintain absolute anonymity. Here are the guidelines for completing this task effectively: 1. Understand the Scenario: The first part of the task is to understand what is happening in the head of the statement. For instance, in the example you've given, the Head is \\"PersonX hears PersonX's music\\". This scenario involves PersonX engaging in an activity, specifically listening to his/her own music. 2. Analyze the Consequence: The next step is to look at the 'Tail', which in this case is labeled as \\"attentive\\". This should be seen as the perception or attribute that might result from the activity occurring in the 'Head'. 3. Determining Perception: Based on the event and the possible persona, you need to reflect whether the action in the 'Head' could result in PersonX being perceived as the characteristic described in the 'Tail'. In the given task, you would decide whether listening to one's own music could make PersonX be seen as 'attentive'. 4. Final Answer: Based on your analysis, you should categorize your answer as either \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\". So if you think listening to one's own music makes PersonX attentive, you would answer \\"Yes\\". If not, your answer would be \\"No\\".

Article: Many are accustomed to picking up dogs as if they were human babies by putting one hand under each of the dog's \\"armpits.\\" However, this is unsafe for dachshunds. This puts an unnatural stress on the dog's back — the spine simply isn't built to support his long body without any other support. In general, you will want to avoid any sort of hold that supports only half of the dog's body length. This is true even if the dog is already standing on one set of legs — like, for instance, if he is propping himself up on his hind legs while looking over the top of a sofa. In this case, you'll want to lean down so that you can support his rump before picking him up. As noted above, dogs should be set down gently, not dropped. A dachshund's legs are very short compared to other dog breeds'. This means that they can't bend very far to absorb the shock of hitting the ground, which puts most of the impact stress on the leg joints and back. Getting rid of the dog's \\"fall\\" eliminates this danger. Don't trust your dog's body language here. Dachshunds don't know that their skeleton can't support falls, so they may be perfectly willing to jump out of your hands. Even if this doesn't cause them immediate pain, it can lead to painful problems if continued in the long-term. Dachshunds' long, slender spines are especially vulnerable to injury, which is why it's so important to keep their bodies straight when you pick them up. You will definitely want to avoid any activities that put a twist or bend in the dog's back, as this increases the stress on it and can contribute to conditions like slipped discs. For example, one way you might accidentally do this is by scooping the dachshund up suddenly when he doesn't expect it. If you startle your dog, he may wriggle or twist out of one of your hands, putting an unnatural bend in his spine as he hangs. Make sure your dog is calm and aware of you before you attempt to pick him up. Dachshunds, like all dogs, are generally pretty smart about letting you know when they are in pain. If your dog looks or sounds uncomfortable when you pick him up, he probably is, so set him back down and re-evaluate the way you're holding him before you try again. Some signs of pain in dogs are obvious, like yelping, whimpering, etc. However, others a little more subtle. The following are nonverbal signs that a dog may be uncomfortable: Trembling (without another explanation, like coldness) Trying to get away Unnatural amounts of affection or aggression Holding the mouth closed (rather than having a natural, \\"happy\\" look) Nothing's more frustrating than when you take the time to learn how to hold your dachshund properly, only for well-meaning relatives to come over and treat him like an ordinary dog. To avoid problems, be sure to educate any visitors about the proper ways to hold your dog before they play with him. This is especially true for children, who can sometimes be too rough with dogs by accident. It's a wise idea to supervise children when they first interact with your dachshund until you're confident that they know how to play safely. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is that dachshunds have unique physical features that demand special care when handling them. Their long spine makes them vulnerable to injury, and picking them up by supporting only half of their body length can cause significant stress on their back.

Sundarikalum Sundaranmarum won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award, India's most prestigious literary award, in 1960. It also received the Asan Centenary Award in 1973, a special award given by the Kerala Sahitya Akademi for the most outstanding work since Independence. The 1988 Malayalam language film 1921 or Ayirathi Thollayirathi Irupathonnu , directed by I. V. Sasi and written by T. Damodaran, depicts the events of the rebellion. The film stars Mammootty as Khadir, a retired Mappila soldier, alongside Madhu as Ali Musliyar. The film won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value in the same year. The rebellion also spawned a large number of Mappila Songs.

Answer a question about this article: After recovering surprisingly fast from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans beat the Samnites in two battles, but were forced to withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome beat the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius and again in the Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. What caused the Romans early withdrawl in The First Samnite War?","completion":"The early withdrawal of the Romans in the First Samnite War (343 BC – 341 BC) was primarily caused by an internal conflict that emerged in the form of the Latin War. The Latin War was a revolt initiated by several of Rome's Latin allies who demanded equal rights and greater autonomy within the Roman confederation. There were various factors that contributed to the Latin War, including the growth and supremacy of Rome in the Italian peninsula and the increasing dissatisfaction among the Latin cities about their subordinate status. The fear of losing their autonomy and cultural identity was widespread among the Latin cities, particularly as Rome started showing signs of imperialistic ambitions. The Romans had to shift their focus away from the Samnites when several Latin cities, including Tibur, Praeneste, and Lanuvium, united to challenge Rome's dominance. The Latin cities' rebellion provoked Rome to redirect their military resources toward countering this new domestic threat. Two significant battles took place during the Latin War: the Battle of Vesuvius in 340 BC and the Battle of Trifanum in 339 BC. The Romans emerged victorious on both occasions, ultimately forcing the Latin cities to submit to Roman rule and give up their ambitions for greater autonomy. These two victories illustrate Rome's ability to allocate resources and military attention to address the immediate threats that were closer to home. In summary, the early withdrawal of the Romans in the First Samnite War was due to the unexpected revolt of their Latin allies that led to the Latin War. Consequently, Rome had to prioritize this internal conflict to maintain its stability and dominance on the Italian peninsula. As a result, the Romans had to withdraw from pursuing the Samnites temporarily, leading to the conclusion of the First Samnite War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: John McCain thinks that's beneath him. Hypothesis: John McCain is an egocentric and narcissistic person. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise provided is: \\"John McCain thinks that's beneath him.\\" In this statement, John McCain supposedly believes that a particular action, task, or situation is not worthy of his time, effort or attention. To fully assess whether this premise entails the hypothesis that John McCain is an egocentric and narcissistic person, a deeper analysis of both the premise and the hypothesis is needed. Egocentrism is characterized by the belief that one's own self-interest and perspectives far outweigh those of others. An egocentric individual often has difficulty understanding or appreciating the feelings, perspectives, or needs of others and tends to prioritize their own needs and desires above all else. Narcissism, on the other hand, is characterized by an excessive interest in or admiration of oneself, often stemming from a deep-rooted need for admiration and validation from others. The hypothesis posits that John McCain's belief that something is \\"beneath him\\" is indicative of egocentrism and narcissism. While it is true that believing certain tasks, actions, or situations to be beneath oneself can be a sign of egocentrism or narcissism, it is important to consider the broader context in which the statement is made. If, for example, John McCain consistently dismisses all tasks or actions that do not contribute directly to his personal gain or reflect positively on his image and accomplishments, it would provide evidence for the hypothesis. This pattern of behavior would demonstrate that McCain prioritizes his interests above others' and has difficulty empathizing with differing viewpoints or values. However, if this statement about something being \\"beneath him\\" is an isolated incident and in response to a morally questionable action, it may not be indicative of egocentrism or narcissism. In such a case, McCain may be expressing a principled stance based on moral or ethical grounds. This would mean that his actions are not guided solely by his own self-interest, but rather by a larger framework of values. Therefore, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis that John McCain is an egocentric and narcissistic person. The belief that something is \\"beneath\\" an individual is context-dependent and may vary depending on the specific circumstances. While it is possible that this statement could be a manifestation of egocentrism or narcissism, it is not guaranteed, and further information would be required to make a definitive conclusion about McCain's character."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on lidia Șimon 's: - weight - caption - height - medaltemplates - birth date - name - image size - image Bio: lidia slăvuțeanu-Șimon -lrb- born 4 september 1973 in târgu cărbunești -rrb- is a romanian long-distance runner . she is the only woman to have competed in the olympic marathon five times -lrb- 1996-2012 -rrb- , winning a silver medal at the 2000 summer olympics in sydney . she is also a former marathon world champion .

Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. I am facing a new situation today: Two pedologists studied different types of soil. Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.

The letterhead on correspondence still bears the Bexar County Legal Aid name, even though the organization is no longer. Texas Rural Legal Aid - known for its fearless and sometimes controversial advocacy of the poorest of the poor - last week took over four other corporations serving the legal needs of the indigent in Southwest Texas, including the one in Bexar County. The new 68-county legal aid organization has yet to be named and stretches from El Paso to Corpus Christi, Harlingen to Austin. The leader for the super-sized law firm has big plans. \\"I'm more interested in looking at what we as advocates can do to address the serious problems of poverty than the number of cases we close,\\" said David Hall, the TRLA executive director. In the Rio Grande Valley, Hall's attorneys set up separate groups to assist small-business owners and residents with low-interest loans and legal representation. They also operate a legal arm that assists migrant workers from Texas to Kentucky. Now, Hall said, he wants to make services to the poor more efficient by working with law students who will handle less complicated legal matters, allowing licensed attorneys to take more \\"high impact\\" cases to court. \\"What we need to do is handle cases as efficiently as we can, leveraging the amount of time of the lawyer that goes in there and maximizing the number of people that they can help at one time,\\" Hall said. His plan is to place the 110 attorneys on staff in teams working on specialized legal issues. He wants to expand the law clinic it already has with St. Mary's University Law School to involve students at the University of Texas Law School. The law students at St. Mary's interview potential clients, assist them with filling out legal documents and answer the telephones for the legal hotline, freeing up TRLA lawyers to handle the complicated cases, Hall said. By the end of September, Hall said all the attorneys working with the poor in the 68county area will be placed on the same computer network so they can pass cases to the best available attorneys. Last year, board members on the former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger, saying that the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress. TRLA generated controversy in 1996, when its attorneys challenged the rights of 800 military personnel to vote in Val Verde County elections by absentee ballot after a former Ku Klux Klan member won a county commissioner post. Brendan Gill, the former executive director of the Bexar County group, said he has since come to see the merger as a positive move for South Texas. \\"I always knew there were good points to merging, just as I knew that there were bad points,\\" Gill said.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn.

Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming. He said the agency claimed he had failed to return a form updating the condition of his health. \\"But what got me was they didn't let me know they didn't get it, they just cut me off,\\" he said, adding he found it impossible to negotiate the Social Security bureaucracy himself.

Please answer the following question: Two signatures. That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

That could all change with a controversial Nov. 4 ballot initiative in which voters will get to decide for the first time whether to abolish a 1963 state law designed to protect small businesses. The law requires North Dakota pharmacies to be owned by local pharmacists or run by hospitals with a local pharmacist on staff. Supporters of the initiative argue it will remove an embarrassing anachronism, give consumers more choice and lower prescription drug costs. Opponents say that allowing national chains would destroy North Dakota’s tradition of personalized pharmacy care and be yet another example of how the state’s neighborly way of life is changing too fast. Canada, Germany, France and many other countries, they also note, have similar laws requiring local pharmacy ownership. “Independent pharmacies are more apt to focus on customer service,” said Gabe Gretz, who bought Service Drug Pharmacy in Williston last year with his father. “This is our bread and butter. It’s not just a hobby for us.” “North Dakota Nice” is a truism here, not an irony, and most retail stores are still prohibited from opening before noon on Sunday - a throwback to laws designed to encourage family time. Yet since the oil boom began around 2010, drawing thousands of new residents to jobs where roughnecks can earn more than 100,000 a year, drug use, assault and other violent crimes have jumped. Recent sex-trafficking charges brought against an oil field worker in Williston, a once quiet town that is now the epicenter of the boom, marked the first charges of that type ever filed in the area and has escalated tension between new and old residents. Many newly arrived oil workers, and even some locals, say they hope the ballot measure passes so that they can use the same chains they’ve grown accustomed to elsewhere. Rite Aid Corp has no outpost in the state, North Dakota’s Walmarts have no in-store pharmacies and the state’s lone Walgreens, on the Minnesota border, is prohibited from selling prescription drugs. CVS is able to operate only a handful of pharmacies in North Dakota thanks to a 2006 buyout of several Osco Drug stores that operated before the 1963 law. “Honestly, it’s not convenient getting my prescriptions here,” said Jan Anseth, a resident of Williston who spends winters in Arizona where she gets her medications from a national chain. In North Dakota, Anseth says, she runs into problems transferring prescriptions and getting anything more than a 30-day supply. The ballot’s primary sponsor, North Dakotans For Lower Pharmacy Prices, was funded with 168,000 in contributions from Walmart, Walgreens, Kmart and others. In campaign materials, the group cites data the Kaiser Family Foundation compiled in 2009 showing North Dakota has one of the highest per capita costs for prescription drug and medical devices in the country. Walmart says North Dakotans are missing out on its popular 4 prescription program, which makes many generic drugs available at the sharply discounted price. Crying foul, the state’s independent pharmacists say they’re able to often meet or beat prices from national chains, most of whom lose money on pharmacy sales as a way to get customers in the door. A random survey by Reuters of North Dakota’s independent pharmacies showed that a 30-day supply of the generic blood thinning drug clopidogrel ranged in price between 10 and 59.95. A CVS in Bismarck, the state capital, quoted a price of 149.95 for the same dosage. “I get to set the prices here at my pharmacy,” said Jenna Wahlstrom, a pharmacist at Larsen Service Drug, which her grandfather founded in Watford City in 1952. “It’s not a corporate decision.” Like the big chains, Wahlstrom offers her customers a smartphone app and online refill ordering. Her pharmacy has transferred hundreds of prescriptions from retail chains for workers who have moved to the state, she said. Ahead of the vote, the state’s top politicians are declining to take sides. Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican who took office in 2010, says he shops at locally owned Aerohead Plaza Drug while in Bismarck and believes it has been able to compete effectively with the nearby CVS. Yet in the 1990s, as a state legislator, Dalrymple voted to keep the pharmacy law intact. “I don’t know,” he now says, “if that was the right vote.”","completion":"Claim: Abolishing the 1963 state law in North Dakota, which requires pharmacies to be owned by local pharmacists or run by hospitals with a local pharmacist on staff, could increase consumer choice and potentially lower prescription drug costs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Similarly, the General Services Administration's (GSA) fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan does not address several long-standing problems identified by the GSA Inspector General.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"All problems are addressed in the plan.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"Similarly, the General Services Administration's (GSA) fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan does not address several long-standing problems identified by the GSA Inspector General\\" is true, then it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"All problems are addressed in the plan.\\" The information provided by the premise suggests that there are indeed gaps in the annual performance plan, specifically in addressing several long-standing problems previously identified by the GSA Inspector General. The hypothesis \\"All problems are addressed in the plan\\" asserts that the plan is comprehensive and has taken into consideration all known issues to be tackled within their specified timeframe. However, the truth of the premise negates that assertion, indicating that the annual performance plan has not dealt with all issues, particularly the ones pointed out by the Inspector General. In light of the premise provided, it is possible to draw some inferences about the situation: 1. Lack of thorough planning: The fact that the annual performance plan doesn't address several long-standing problems could suggest a lack of thorough planning on the part of the GSA. This might point towards inadequacies in their strategic planning process, or perhaps they lack the necessary resources or expertise to tackle all known problems effectively. 2. Priority discrepancies: It is also possible that the GSA might have different priorities in terms of problems to be addressed as compared to the Inspector General. The annual performance plan might have focused on issues that are more pressing from their perspective, hence they might have deliberately chosen to address only certain problems in their plan for the fiscal year 2000. 3. Incomplete communication channels: Another possible explanation for the contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis is that there might have been communication gaps between the GSA and the Inspector General. The issues mentioned by the Inspector General might not have been effectively communicated to those responsible for creating the annual performance plan, leading to their omission. Overall, if the premise is true, it disproves the hypothesis stating that \\"All problems are addressed in the plan\\" and showcases that the GSA's fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan has not taken into consideration all long-standing problems identified by the Inspector General. This can potentially raise concerns about the comprehensiveness and effectiveness of the GSA's planning processes, and it might necessitate a closer examination of their priorities as well as their communication and coordination with the Inspector General."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Here is an article: And yet, despite its sometimes breathless tone and metaphorical overreaching, “Bottom of the 33rd” is as good a book about, yes, communion and possibility in baseball as any, a worthy companion to Roger Kahn’s classic “Boys of Summer,” about the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s. While the books’ subjects are baseball opposites — one bizarre minor-league game versus a historically beloved major-league team — Mr. Barry, like Mr. Kahn, exploits the power of memory and nostalgia with literary grace and journalistic exactitude. He blends a vivid, moment-by-moment re-creation of the game with what happens to its participants in the next 30 years. (Mr. Barry wasn’t present that night, but he lived in Pawtucket and was a reporter for The Providence Journal several years later.) This is a fastball of literary devices — hindsight, like Ted Williams’s vision, can be 20/10 — but it works wonderfully here, thanks to a diverse roster of characters. The third basemen, Cal Ripken Jr. for Rochester and Wade Boggs for Pawtucket, will enjoy careers that lead to baseball’s Hall of Fame. A free-spirited Dutchman named Win Remmerswaal, who pitches in the 18th through the 22nd innings for Pawtucket, will become an alcoholic, suffer brain damage and wind up confined to a wheelchair in a nursing home in The Hague. The exquisitely named Rochester right fielder, Drungo Hazewood, will exit baseball bitterly, drive a truck and think about “the best time of his life: the days he spent playing baseball on nights like this, as cold as it is, with got-your-back teammates close by, and the Baltimore organization invested in his future.” During the final game of the 1986 World Series two former Pawtucket teammates, Bruce Hurst and Bob Ojeda, “will spot each other, one in a Red Sox uniform, one in a Mets uniform, and their eyes will lock in wordless communication, conveying so much, including: Pawtucket.” The Pawtucket club owner, Ben Mondor, and his two young lieutenants will run the team for the next three decades. The game’s eventual hero, the Pawtucket first baseman Dave Koza, will struggle in and then out of baseball before righting his life back in the city where he enjoyed his moment of fame. The foreknowledge imbues “Bottom of the 33rd” with resonance and depth. Participants tell Mr. Barry that a day doesn’t go by that they don’t think about the game, or that it defined their lives, or that it gave them a great story — like that of the Rochester pitcher Jim Umbarger, who consumed “20 or so cups of coffee” and threw 10 scoreless innings, the 23rd through the 32nd; or Danny Card, 9 years old at the time, who stayed because his father had once pledged never to leave a game early. “I learned what a promise meant,” Mr. Card tells Mr. Barry. Mostly the participants remember the surreal nature of a game that wouldn’t end. By the 24th inning Mr. Barry wonders: “Is this even a baseball game anymore? Maybe it has morphed into some kind of extravagant form of performance art, in which the failure to reach climax is the point; in which the repetition of scoreless innings signals the meaninglessness of existence. Then again, maybe the performance is intended to convey the opposite message: That this is all a celebration of mystery, a divine reminder that the human condition is too complex and unpredictable, so enjoy this party while you can.” A bit over the top? Sure, but asking existential questions seems not only reasonable but also necessary when it comes to a game in which players burned broken bats in garbage drums to stay warm, and family members called hospitals searching for loved ones who should have come home hours earlier. It’s fitting, and for Mr. Barry narratively ideal, that baseball’s longest game occurred in the rung just below the majors, Triple-A, populated by has-beens and will-bes and those in between. Everyone in Triple-A is at a life-changing crossroads, even if they don’t yet know it, but for one night there in April 1981 time simply stopped. In the moment those present wanted the insanity to end; three decades later they are grateful that it didn’t. The tie game was resumed on a warm Tuesday evening in June. This time McCoy Stadium was packed with 6,000 fans and 150 journalists, all of them intruders on a private moment. What took 8 hours 7 minutes and 32 innings to start required just 18 minutes and 1 inning to finish, with a bases-loaded bloop single by Mr. Koza. He never went on to play in the majors. But the bat he used to stroke that winning hit is in the Hall of Fame. Hope, Redemption and Baseball’s Longest Game Illustrated. 255 pages. Harper. 26.99.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. On Tuesday, less than a week after the death of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, the news broke that his life will be turned into a biopic starring none other than Jared Leto. The Academy Award-winning actor is in the early stages (so early that there's neither a release date nor a title for it just yet) of making a movie about Hefner’s life with producer Brett Ratner, who’s slated to direct. \\"Jared is an old friend,\\" Ratner told The Hollywood Reporter. \\"When he heard I got the rights to Hef's story, he told me, 'I want to play him. I want to understand him.' And I really believe Jared can do it. He's one of the great actors of today.\\" Leto isn’t just an actor: he’s also an avid mountain climber (albeit one who scales the slopes wearing copious amounts of Gucci) and the frontman of the band 30 Seconds to Mars. Word has it he never had the opportunity to meet Hefner in person, but that shouldn’t stop him from turning out a great performance. Hefner lived his life in full view of the public for well over 60 years, and with talk shows, reality shows, and even movie and TV cameos, his mannerisms and personal style should be easy for Leto to capture. And if Ray, The King's Speech, and Braveheart are any indication, this film has a good chance of setting him up to win another Oscar. In the meantime, his next movie, Blade Runner 2049, will premiere on Friday, Oct. 6. ||||| Jared Leto has officially signed on to play the late Playboy founder Hugh Hefner in an upcoming biopic, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The announcement comes just a week after Hefner passed away at 91, but the film's reportedly been in the works for the better part of a decade. The Hef biopic is the brainchild of Brett Ratner, the guy who gave us Rush Hour and directed the goofiest X-Men movie ever made. Ratner's been scrambling to tell Hefner's weird-ass life story for years, at one point nabbing Robert Downey Jr. to star before the project went haywire, according to the Reporter. In April, the Big Butt Book–loving director finally got the greenlight to make the movie—and, as he tells it, his \\"old friend\\" Leto became the leading contender for the starring role almost immediately. \\"When [Leto] heard I got the rights to Hef's story, he told me, 'I want to play him. I want to understand him,'\\" Ratner told the Reporter. \\"And I really believe Jared can do it. He's one of the great actors of today.\\" Ratner even took Leto down to the Playboy mansion for a premiere of the Amazon docuseries American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story, which also doubled as the tycoon's 91st birthday party. Ratner had hoped to introduce Leto to the onetime Curb guest star in person, but apparently Hef wasn't feeling well enough for the visit. Still, Ratner's convinced the actor will handle the role just fine. \\"There's enough footage on Hef out there that Jared will be able to get as much information as he wants,\\" he told the Reporter. Leto just finished wrapping up Blade Runner 2049, and he's still slated to play Andy Warhol in another upcoming biopic. The Hefner movie is still in early development, and there's no timeline about when it will go into production, but whenever it does, Leto's co-stars better get ready for some gross-ass gifts behind the scenes. ||||| In some news that we weren’t hoping to start our day off with, The Hollywood Reporter has revealed that Jared Leto will take on the role of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, who died just last week at the age of 91, for Brett Ratner’s long-in-development biopic surrounding the late media mogul. The project has been in limbo since 2007 when it was originally set up at Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment. However, the film sat on the shelf for a number of years and the rights soon expired, leading to them being purchased by producer Jerry Weintraub for Warner Bros. Advertisement “Jared is an old friend,” Rater, who acquired the rights to the project after Weintraub’s death in 2015, told THR. “When he heard I got the rights to Hef’s story, he told me, ‘I want to play him. I want to understand him.’ And I really believe Jared can do it. He’s one of the great actors of today.” I think we can all agree that this biopic will shy away from being an honest retelling of Hefner’s actual life story and will more so serve as a celebration of his life, to which I say, in the words of Ira Madison III: “Keep it.” ||||| The producer of the upcoming Hefner biopic believes the Playboy founder and \\"consummate optimist\\" was one of a handful of leaders who made American culture less intolerant and repressive. Hef was my friend. He was the coolest. And the hippest. And at the same time, the squarest. While he transformed from an Illinois prude to the ultimate urban sophisticate, he never lost the Midwest values on which he was raised. His word was bankable. His heart was a well of emotion, open for all to see. He was the least prejudiced man I ever knew. He had deep pockets and long arms. I admired him differently at different times. When I was a kid, he was the embodiment of everything I wanted but seemed hopelessly out of reach: beautiful women, a kingly mansion, a bunny-emblazoned DC-9. He smoked a pipe and wore pajamas, both day and night. So did my uncle Mario, but he was a doctor and unfortunately wasn’t dating Barbie Benton. In those days, Hef’s name was synonymous with sin. For me, like most young American boys, getting my hands on a Playboy was the ultimate forbidden fruit … the joys of living before the internet. But in those days, I thought the interviews with Norman Mailer, the short stories by John Cheever or the poems by Allen Ginsberg were mere fillers that kept The Girls of the Big Ten from slamming directly into Miss November. In my 20s and 30s, when fortune smiled on me and I actually came to know Hef, spending time at the mansion, I admired his decency and his hospitality, how he made this Jewish kid from Miami Beach with a couple of movies under his belt feel as if he’d made it in a town that can be both magical and difficult. I also realized that by his fostering the literary and performing arts, by putting the wealth of his organization and the power of his convictions squarely on the side of civil liberties for all of our citizens, he was trying to make this country a better and fairer place. Now that he’s gone, I realize more than ever that he didn’t have to do those things. Many titans of industry have no interest in contributing to the Greater Good. Certainly Hef enjoyed money and what it could buy. But his most treasured acquisitions were friends of whom there are too many to count and causes that were unabashedly progressive — of which he was justifiably proud. My personal relationship with Hef actually started when I read that Brian Grazer was to produce a biopic about him. I sent Brian my classic 1970s playboy pinball machine with a note telling him that he’d found his director. After Brian capitulated, I had a series of meetings with Hef, desperately trying to crack how to tell the story, which is the odyssey of his life. The development process went through many incarnations — Imagine, Universal (with Robert Downey Jr. attached), Jerry Weintraub at Warners, and then, thankfully, it became available again. A dream came true: I bought it for RatPac. There will never be another Hugh Hefner, but getting to make a movie about his life is, I guess, the next best thing. The America into which Hugh Hefner was born was in many ways intolerant and repressive. He, among only a handful of men in our history, made it less so. It saddened him to see the pendulum swinging the other way. But Hef was the consummate optimist.

But second, I want to remind him that if he acts like a jerk, I could wind up writing something like this: I’ve been cornered downstairs in the gold lamé disco basement at Brett Ratner’s house and he’s hitting on me. That was the opening line of a profile I wrote of Ratner in October 2008. I worked hard to persuade him to interview with me, but not that hard, since the very first time I met him, at an event at American Jewish University, he gave me his phone number. My M.O. after that was turn his own trick right back on him: Don’t take ‘no’ for an answer. That line is part of the Brett-Ratner-rise-in-Hollywood mythology – and has been referenced countless times (see: Entourage, profiles etc.). But it’s also part of the mythology of Brett Ratner the man: He doesn’t take ‘no.’ He has no boundaries. He does whatever the heck he wants. It’s part of his big-Hollywood-director cache. And most of the time, he gets away with it. Not anymore. My guess is that if it were up to Brett Ratner The Man, and not Brett Ratner The Director, to get women to like him, he could have played The Forty-Year-Old-Virgin instead of Steve Carrell. And not because he’s modest and cute and shy; because he’s disrespectful and smarmy and childish. Every time I see Brett Ratner, he hits on me again. Though only after he insults me: “You’re still at the Jewish Journal? Your piece on me was supposed to advance your career.” (Editor’s note: It did. I got salaried and health insurance.) The last time I saw him, at the Museum of Tolerance dinner honoring Tom Cruise, he said, “You’re cute, but can you cook?” Months later, I texted him to ask for an interview about “Tower Heist” (which he did not grant) and to maybe do a live Q-and-A with me in advance of the Oscar cast he was supposed to produce. I asked if we could have lunch and talk it over. He only wanted to know if I still had a boyfriend. After all this, I figure, ‘This is his shtick. This is what he does. This is who he is.’ But when I read what he says about other women, how he humiliates them with the bully pulpit he doesn’t deserve – for example, he referred to Olivia Munn, who at the age of 30 has accomplished more than most, as a “whore” and revealed to Howard Stern that he forced Lindsay Lohan, who has enough problems, to get checked for sexually transmitted diseases before he would sleep with her—I get angry. Then I feel inclined to say things like this: If Lindsay Lohan was infected with the Ebola virus, Ratner would be lucky to get five minutes in a room with her. But admittedly, I have Ratner baggage. When I look back on my first big Hollywood interview, I remember sitting on Ratner’s couch, with a handful of people around, watching Albert Lamorisse’s The Red Balloon, and repeatedly removing Ratner’s hands from between my legs. I was a young, inexperienced journalist then, and told myself that getting the story was more important than my dignity. So in a big way, I’m grateful to Brett Ratner – because the very same profile that got me a full-time reporting job was also the one that taught me that no story is worth compromising my integrity. I should have slapped him and stormed from the house. It would have been cinematic. It is precisely because movies represent some imaginative ideal that the movie industry should have standards. Lots of directors get away with way worse than Ratner – Roman Polanski comes to mind, for example. Famous people tend to get away with things, because they’re famous and they can. Today was the first day Brett Ratner didn’t get away with it. Earlier today, I wrote that I didn’t care whether Ratner produced the Oscars or not, but in the dark of evening, long after the sun has set, I applaud the Academy for taking a stand – for standing for something. It was a Jewish thing to do. ||||| Noted Hollywood fauxteur Brett Ratner appeared on Attack of the Show to pimp his latest brain-smoothing studio confection, Tower Heist. After a comfortable amount of brown-nosing, host Kevin Pereira pointedly asked the director if rumors were true that a particularly unflattering passage in former co-host Olivia Munn's memoir, Suck It, Wonder Woman!: The Misadventures Of A Hollywood Geek, had referred to Ratner. (The story, as Munn recounts it, involved a major movie director whipping out his tiny penis without warning and proceeding to jerk off, while simultaneously eating cocktail-sauce-slathered jumbo shrimps with the other hand.) Ratner immediately knew which story Pereira was referring to, and offered this version of events. (It begins in the video below at 3:45.) \\"I used to date Olivia Munn, I'll be honest with everyone here. But when she was 'Lisa.' She wasn't Asian back then. She was hanging out on my set of After the Sunset, I banged her a few times, but I forgot her. Because she changed her name. I didn't know it was the same person and so when she auditioned for me for a TV show, I forgot her, she got pissed off, and so she made up all these stories about me eating shrimp and masturbating in my trailer. And she talked about my shortcomings.\\" At which point Pereira added: \\"To be fair, you did ask for shrimp cocktail in the green room today.\\" So draw your own conclusions. ||||| Movie director and shrimp-eating fapper, Brett Ratner, called into Howard Stern (via EW) yesterday to spit out a half-assed apology to GLAAD for saying “rehearsals is for fags” during a Q&A for Tower Heiest last week and he also admitted that he lied when he said that he “banged” Olivia Munn back when she wasn’t Asian. With the scent of curdled goat leche and shrimp shit wafting off of his finger tips, Brett picked up the phone and said this to Howard about Olivia: “She’s actually talented. The problem is I made her look like she’s a whore.” Brett kept backpedaling (unfortunately he didn’t backpedal off of a cliff) and gave GLAAD an “I’m Soooo SOWWY” hug for using the word fag. “I apologize for any offense my remarks caused. It was a dumb way of expressing myself. Everyone who knows me knows that I don’t have a prejudiced bone in my body. But as a storyteller I should have been much more thoughtful about the power of language and my choice of words.” Brett is producing the next Oscars and the president of that shit says that his comments were “dumb and insensitive” but “the apology [Ratner] gave I truly believe comes from his heart. If I didn’t believe it, I would do something about it. This is about integrity and honoring the Academy Awards, but we all make mistakes and I believe he didn’t mean it.” That apology came from Brett’s checking account, since he has a stupid movie to sell, and not his heart. That is the correction. But really. Brett Ratner is an exact stereotype of a sleazy, flea-dicked movie director who keeps a murphy bed in his office and honestly thinks he’s fooling a bitch with those tragic hair plugs, so none of us should strain our emotions by being shocked when words of doucheness fall out of his mouth. Allow me to put it more eloquently: Fuck him, fuck his awful movies and fuck his sweaty piss bag of a face. Seriously, I’d rather lick a condensation drop on an overheated piss bag than go see Tower Heist. (Yes, mom, that is my way of telling you that I will not see Tower Heist with you when I visit.) And Brett should call into Howard Stern again tomorrow to apologize for calling himself a storyteller. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Jared Leto, who is an actor and also a mountain climber and the singer of a band called 30 Seconds to Mars, is going to play Hugh Hefner in a movie about his life.

Information: - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - OGLE - TR - 113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE - TR - 113 . In 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) detected periodic dimming in the star 's light curve indicating a transiting , planetary - sized object . Since low - mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet , radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body . In 2004 , the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet . The planet has a mass 1.32 times that of Jupiter . Since the planet 's inclination is known , the value is exact . It orbits the star ( OGLE - TR - 113 ) in an extremely close orbit , even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1.43 days . The radius of the planet is only 9 % larger than Jupiter 's , despite the heating effect by the star . Planets of its kind are sometimes called \`\` super-hot Jupiters '' . - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - OGLE-TR-113 is a dim, distant magnitude 16 binary star in the star fields of the constellation Carina. Because of its distance of about 1800 light years, and location in a crowded field it was not notable in any way. Spectral type of the star is type K dwarf star, slightly cooler and less luminous than the Sun. What is the relationship between 'ogle-tr-113b' and 'carina'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between 'OGLE-TR-113b' and 'Carina' is that OGLE-TR-113b is an extrasolar planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-113, which is a dim, distant binary star located in the constellation Carina.

The first time I tried watching it I could only make it halfway through, before losing interest. Again it gets off to a good start (especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Dracula), but then for me it got less involving when it hits New Orleans to focus on Van Helsing's daughter. A great place to set it, but never took advantage of its settings (despite etching a paradise in damn, where Dracula could flourish). Produced by Wes Carven (and yeah they throw that name out there), but written / directed by Patrick Lussier. Artistically it had its moments with few dreamlike visuals, but some kinetic editing and cheap jolts don't help. The messy script does get considerably silly. Lussier does a polished job that remains rather glassy, inserting a lot of blood (the make-up is suitably achieved) and a lot of \\"Virgin\\" advertising. No I don't mean virgins, it's the music company, as it does get in numerous shots and Helsing's daughter works there too. Oh that wasn't obvious planting. The soundtrack is an amusing choice of rock tunes. Now the performances are all over the shop, but there are few familiar faces to spot (Danny Masterson, Sean Patrick Thomas, Nathan Fillion, Shane West and Lochlyn Munro). Gerard Butler as Dracula just didn't come off, as not much of a presence was formed. He was simply out-shined by the succulent ladies of the night; Jennifer Esposito, Colleen Fitzpatrick and Jeri Ryan as Dracula's brides.

Given the question: - The liver filters blood from the digestive tract - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea What might be the last step of the process? The answer is:","completion":"The last step of the process could be the excretion of the converted waste products and the distribution of essential nutrients and substances throughout the body to maintain homeostasis. After the liver has performed its various functions, such as filtering the blood, producing bile, synthesizing proteins, converting glucose into glycogen, and transforming ammonia into urea, the final step of the process is to ensure that the waste products, along with essential nutrients, are distributed effectively within the body. Waste products like urea, which is produced from the conversion of ammonia, are transported by the blood to the kidneys. Here, they are filtered out and excreted through urine. This removal of waste is crucial for maintaining the body's internal equilibrium and preventing the accumulation of toxic substances. In addition to eliminating waste products, the liver also plays a crucial role in distributing essential nutrients and substances throughout the body. Some examples are: 1. Iron Storage: The liver stores excess iron from the food we consume, which can then be utilized by the body to produce red blood cells. 2. Vitamin Storage: The liver also stores fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K. These vitamins are essential for the body's proper functioning and contribute to various aspects of our health like eyesight, immune system, and bone health. 3. Blood Clotting Factors: The liver produces proteins necessary for blood coagulation, which helps in the prevention of excessive bleeding during injuries or other incidents. 4. Glycogen Storage: When the liver converts excess glucose into glycogen, it stores this glycogen and releases it back into the bloodstream as glucose when the body needs energy, such as during periods of fasting or high-energy demand. In summary, the last step of the liver's process involves working with other organs such as the kidneys to excrete waste products like urea and distributing essential nutrients and substances like glycogen throughout the body to maintain homeostasis and ensure the various body systems continue to function efficiently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor.

A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.

The song was written by Georgia Dobbins, William Garrett, Freddie Gorman, Brian Holland, and Robert Bateman. Produced by Brian Holland, the single became Motown's first number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The Marvelettes' version of \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" is a classic R&B/pop track that reflects the heartfelt feelings of a young girl waiting for a letter from her lover. The song's relatable theme, combined with the group's soulful harmonies and the catchy melody, resonated with audiences and made it a timeless hit.

The duo transformed the track into a cheerful and infectious tune that appealed to a wider audience. In conclusion, \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" has seen considerable success through three different and iconic acts: The Marvelettes, The Beatles, and The Carpenters. Each group brought their unique style and interpretation to the song, while staying true to its core message of anticipation and longing.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The given phrase \\"Vaihtoehtona on sosiaalinen polkumyynti\\" is in Finnish and translates to \\"The alternative is social dumping\\" in English. To provide a detailed explanation of the term \\"social dumping\\" in this context, it refers to a wide range of practices in which employers seek to take advantage of the differences in wage levels, working conditions, and regulatory frameworks between different countries or regions, in order to reduce labor costs and gain a competitive advantage over competitors in the global market. Simply put, it occurs when companies exploit workers by paying them less than the usual or legally required wage rates in their region, leading to unfair competition and poor working conditions. There are several reasons why social dumping occurs, and they can be broadly classified into the following categories: 1. Wage differences: Substantial disparities in wage levels between different countries or regions may incentivize employers to shift production or outsource work to areas where labor is cheaper. 2. Differences in labor regulations: Some countries may have weaker labor laws or less stringent enforcement of existing regulations, making it easier for companies to exploit workers without facing legal consequences. 3. Globalization and trade liberalization: The increased ease of trade and globalization has made it more accessible for companies to operate across borders and take advantage of differences in labor conditions. Social dumping can have several negative consequences, both for workers and the economy as a whole. These can include: 1. Exploitation of workers: Social dumping often leads to poor working conditions, long working hours, and reduced job security for the affected workers. This can contribute to a deterioration in physical and mental health, as well as an increased risk of accidents and injuries. 2. Undermining labor rights: The practice of social dumping can weaken the bargaining power of workers and trade unions, making it more difficult for them to negotiate fair wages and decent working conditions. 3. Erosion of labor standards: Widespread social dumping can set off a \\"race to the bottom\\" in terms of labor standards, as companies compete to cut costs by exploiting workers and lowering their conditions. 4. Negative effects on the economy: By reducing workers' income and spending power, social dumping can contribute to lower overall consumer demand and slower economic growth. To address and prevent social dumping, it is essential for governments and international organizations to work together to harmonize labor standards, strengthen enforcement of labor laws, and promote fair competition between businesses. This can be achieved by ensuring that workers are protected through equal access to labor rights and regulations, regardless of their nationality or the country in which they work. Moreover, it is crucial for businesses to adopt ethical labor practices that respect the rights and well-being of workers and contribute positively to the communities in which they operate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A Jeddah Criminal Court found Raif Badawi, who has been in prison since June 2012, guilty this week of insulting Islam through his website and in television comments. \\"This incredibly harsh sentence for a peaceful blogger makes a mockery of Saudi Arabia's claims that it supports reform and religious dialogue,\\" said Nadim Houry, the deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \\"A man who wanted to discuss religion has already been locked up for a year and now faces 600 lashes and seven years in prison.\\" Raif Badawi has been in prison since June His lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, told Human Rights Watch that Judge al-Harbi read the verdict Monday. The court is expected to send him a written notification by August 6. They'll have 30 days to appeal. Case separates family Ensaf Haidar, Badawi's wife, said she's devastated by the news. \\"I don't know what to do,\\" Haidar said Wednesday. \\"Raif did nothing wrong.\\" Haidar and the couple's three children now live in Lebanon. Estranged from her family, Haidar said it would be impossible to take her children back to Saudi Arabia. The stigma is too strong there. \\"You feel like everybody's accusing you,\\" she said, close to tears, in an April interview. \\"Like everybody's against you, at war with you.\\" CNN has made several attempts to reach the Saudi Arabia government for comment but received no response. A contentious five years Badawi's legal troubles started shortly after he started the Free Saudi Liberals website in 2008. He was detained for one day and questioned about the site. Some clerics even branded him an unbeliever and apostate. Last summer, Human Rights Watch released a statement urging Saudi authorities to free Badawi. \\"Saudi authorities should drop charges and release the editor of the Free Saudi Liberals website for violating his right to freedom of expression on matters of religion and religious figures,\\" a statement from the group said at the time. Rights groups accuse Saudi authorities of targeting activists through the courts and travel bans. Many were outraged when two of the country's most prominent reform advocates, Mohammed Al-Qahtani and Abdullah Al-Hamid, were sentenced in March to 10 years in prison apiece. Amnesty International called that trial \\"just one of a troubling string of court cases aimed at silencing the kingdom's human-rights activists.\\" Asked in January about accusations that Saudi Arabia is cracking down on dissent, Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki, spokesman for the Saudi Interior Ministry, told CNN, \\"At the Interior Ministry, our area of responsibility is security.\\" He added, \\"My understanding is that these cases are being looked at by the courts now. Nobody will comment on cases being looked at by the courts.\\" ||||| Image caption Raef Badawi was facing a possible death sentence for apostasy A Saudi online activist has been jailed for seven years and sentenced to 600 lashes for urging religious liberalisation, his lawyer has said. The activist, Raef Badawi, co-founded the Free Saudi Liberals website, an online forum for public debate. He was arrested last year and convicted on Monday of setting up a website that undermined general security. Amnesty International considers Mr Badawi a political prisoner and has called for his immediate release. Mr Badawi was originally charged with apostasy, or abandonment of religion, a crime in Saudi Arabia that carries with it the death penalty. Lawyer Waleed Abu Alkhair told the BBC that Mr Badawi, a father of three, had confirmed in court that he was a Muslim but told the judge \\"everyone has a choice to believe or not believe.\\" He was convicted of the charges of setting up a website that undermines general security and of ridiculing religious figures. The judge ordered that the 600 lashes be administered 150 at a time. Mr Alkhair said the charges were over comments the activist posted calling for a relaxation of Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islam. The lawyer said the sentence was unduly harsh. \\"The lashes could be spread out but in Sharia this is a sign that the judge wants to insult him,\\" he said. His lawyer said he will appeal against the decision. ||||| The founder of a liberal-minded website in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes after angering Islamic authorities in the ultraconservative kingdom, a newspaper reported Tuesday. Raif Badawi, through his website known as Free Saudi Liberals, had urged Saudis to share opinions about the role of religion in the country, which follows a strict form of Islam that includes harsh punishments for challenging customs. A judge in the Red Sea port of Jiddah imposed the sentences but dropped charges of apostasy, which could have brought a death sentence, the Al-Watan newspaper reported. Badawi has been held since June 2012. The newspaper did not name the judge who sentenced Badawi, nor did it say when the ruling was handed down. It was unclear Tuesday whether Badawi would receive any credit for the time he's already served. Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, said Tuesday that the U.S. was \\"deeply concerned\\" by the sentence given to Badawi. \\"We believe that when public speech is deemed offensive, be it via social media or any other means, the issue is best addressed through open dialogue and honest debate,\\" Psaki said. Hard-line Saudi clerics have raised repeated objections to social media, including one prominent Islamic scholar describing Twitter as a path to hell. He later withdrew the comment. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A Saudi court has sentenced activist Raif Badawi to seven years in prison and 600 lashes for violating the nation's anti-cybercrime law, according to Human Rights Watch.

She was sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison for third-degree murder for her role in illegally performing buttocks injections. Although it is reportedly rumored that Black Madam performed buttocks injections on various individuals in the entertainment industry, Amber Rose, an American model, actress, and television personality, has been the most prominent figure connected with Black Madam in media reports. The allegations surfaced during Black Madam's trial in a Philadelphia court in 2015. During her defense, she claimed to have provided her services to Amber Rose, among others. Amber Rose has never publicly addressed or confirmed these claims, and it is essential to understand that these allegations have not been proven to be true.

We can do this by subtracting 1335 from both sides of the equation: 1659 - 1335 = -27 * o + 1335 - 1335 This simplifies to: 324 = -27 * o Now, we need to isolate o by dividing both sides of the equation by -27: 324 / -27 = (-27 * o) / -27 This simplifies to: -12 = o So, the solution to the equation 1659 = -27 * o + 1335 is o = -12."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Throughout the film, Grant's reflections on his marriage are woven with his reflections on his own infidelities, and influence his eventual decisions regarding Fiona's happiness.

They have not been given any details, either due to the absence of communication or the conscious withholding of information from others involved. The absence of information could lead to uncertainty, misinterpretation, or lack of action, depending on the context surrounding the situation. In essence, the speaker is highlighting the fact that they lack the necessary knowledge and communication. On the other hand, \\"We have been informed\\" implies that the speaker and their group have received information related to a specific topic or issue. It indicates that someone else has disclosed knowledge about the matter, giving the speaker and their group access to the required information. In using this phrase, the speaker confirms that they have received certain details, which could then be used to make decisions, draw conclusions, or take action. In short, the key distinction between the two statements lies in the presence or absence of information. While \\"We are not told\\" implies that the speaker lacks knowledge on a specific topic or issue, \\"We have been informed\\" suggests that the speaker has received the necessary information.

Translate to English","completion":"DTP (Democratic Society Party) is planning to gather here with Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran, as well as representatives of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party). The Democratic Society Party (DTP) aims to bring together various Kurdish groups from different countries in the region, namely Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran. It is important to understand the context and the key players involved in this plan to better grasp the implications of this meeting. The Kurdish people, who are an ethnic group native to a region spanning parts of Eastern Turkey, Northern Iraq, Western Iran, and North-Eastern Syria, have been seeking varying levels of autonomy and self-determination in their respective countries for decades. As a result, various political organizations and armed groups have been formed to represent the Kurdish interests in different countries, leading to some of these groups being labeled as terrorist organizations by the governments they oppose. The Democratic Society Party (DTP) is a political party in Turkey that mainly focuses on advocating for the rights and recognition of the Kurdish population in the country. Formed in 2005, the party has attempted to serve as a political platform for Kurdish issues, which have often been underrepresented or even suppressed in Turkey's political landscape. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is a Kurdish militant and political organization based in Turkey and Iraqi Kurdistan, which has been involved in an armed struggle against the Turkish state since 1983. The PKK is considered a terrorist organization by several countries and international organizations, including Turkey, the United States, and the European Union. The plan for the DTP to bring together Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran, as well as representatives of the PKK, represents an effort to bridge the geographical and political divides between these diverse Kurdish communities and militant groups. Such a meeting would potentially help the participating Kurdish groups to establish common goals and develop a united front in their quest for greater autonomy, political representation, and human rights. It is worth noting, however, that any collaboration or negotiation between the DTP and the PKK could be seen as controversial given the latter's designation as a terrorist organization. This means that the proposed gathering could face opposition or criticism from both within and outside the Kurdish community, as well as from the governments of the countries where these groups are based. In conclusion, the DTP's plan to gather Kurdish groups from Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran, alongside representatives of the PKK, demonstrates an attempt to foster solidarity and cooperation among Kurdish communities across national borders. The outcomes of such a gathering may have a significant impact on the Kurdish struggle for autonomy and better representation in their respective countries, although the contentious nature of the PKK's involvement may pose challenges to the success of this initiative."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The response from the Swiss authorities is positive, while computer security experts continue to express skepticism about the security of online balloting with current technology. To analyze this excerpt more thoroughly, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the main topic of the excerpt. 2. Identify the main actors and stakeholders. 3. Identify the opinions and concerns raised by the different stakeholders. Step 1: Identifying the main topic The main topic of this excerpt is the test of Internet voting in a national referendum in Switzerland. Step 2: Identifying the main actors and stakeholders The main actors and stakeholders in this excerpt are: - Swiss authorities: presumably responsible for elections and the implementation of the Internet voting test. - Computer security experts: who are concerned about the security of online balloting. Step 3: Identifying the opinions and concerns raised by the different stakeholders Swiss authorities view the test as a success. This suggests they are satisfied with the outcomes and possibly confident in the security of the system or at least its potential to be improved. On the other hand, computer security experts are skeptical about the security of online balloting using current technologies. This indicates that they may believe the technology isn't yet secure enough to protect the integrity of the voting process. They might be concerned that the risks of hacking, fraud, or other malicious activities could compromise the fairness and accuracy of election results. In conclusion, this excerpt is about a national referendum internet voting test in Switzerland, which the Swiss authorities consider successful.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. According to the above context, answer the following question. When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality? Answer:","completion":"People were MOST likely to overeat processed food due to the high salt content. The study showed that participants consumed 11% more kilojoules when the meals were high in salt, regardless of the fat content."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Обратите внимание, что автоматическую настройку паролей использовать небезопасно, так как любой может получить доступ к файлу ответов и узнать пароли. Translate to English","completion":"Please note that using an automatic password configuration can be insecure because anyone can gain access to the answer file and find out the passwords. The automatic password configuration refers to the process of setting up and storing passwords with the help of software that might automate the process. There are some primary concerns associated with using this method. Let us dive deeper into this topic and discuss each concern in detail. 1. Lack of control over password generation: The automatic password configuration often lets the software generate passwords without much input from the user. As a result, users have limited control over the complexity and uniqueness of generated passwords. If the software uses a weak or predictable algorithm for creating passwords, this can lead to weak passwords that are easy to guess or crack, making the system vulnerable to attacks. 2. Centralization of sensitive data: When relying on a single tool or software for managing passwords, all the sensitive data, such as login credentials, are stored in a centralized location. Hackers may target this centralized location, and if they succeed in infiltrating the system, they can gain access to multiple passwords at once, which poses a significant security risk. 3. Vulnerability to malware and hacking: As mentioned earlier, if someone gains access to the answer file (for instance, a file containing the generated passwords), they can easily get hold of the critical data. This situation becomes more dangerous if the user is unaware that their system has been breached, leaving the hacker plenty of time and opportunities to exploit the compromised data. To mitigate these risks, some best practices can be followed: 1. Use reliable password managers: Instead of relying on automatic password configuration tools that may be insecure, users should opt for trustworthy and well-established password managers. These applications offer robust security features, generate strong and unique passwords, and store them securely. 2. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA): MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring multiple pieces of information (such as a password and a temporary code sent to a registered device) to verify your identity before granting access. This practice makes it more challenging for hackers to breach your accounts even if they possess your password. 3. Regularly update your software: Ensuring that your system and password manager are updated to the latest versions is crucial for maintaining security. Software updates generally contain security patches that address known vulnerabilities, making it harder for attackers to exploit them. 4. Educate users about security practices: It is essential to train and educate users about secure password practices, such as generating strong passwords, not reusing passwords across multiple sites, and updating them regularly. This knowledge will help users adopt secure habits and lower the chances of a security breach. In conclusion, automatic password configuration can be highly insecure, as it may expose sensitive data and password information to potential threats. It is essential to be aware of these risks and follow best practices on password management and security to protect your accounts and data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spectrum fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded. Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets. 1.

To combine the apples, we just add the numbers: (-82 + 53) * y = 174 (-29) * y = 174 Now we want to find out what 'y' is - it means how many times we need to do this process. To do this, we will divide 174 by -29: y = 174 / (-29) When we do the math, we get: y = -6 And there we have it!

Answer:","completion":"The review is positive."},{"prompt":"Question: I have a new situation: Many years ago there was a beach Called Coast Brigs where many coral and other life lived. A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine. But I can use this background: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. What is an answer for this question: Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"Building a refinery at Greendale is likely to cause the acidity of the water to increase, especially if the refinery burns fossil fuels like coal.

Please answer the following question: Recently a large amount of factories have been built in Illinois using fossil fuels as their main energy source. In Indiana however, many of their factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with many plants and trees. Given Illinois adds even more of these fossil fuel burning factories will the levels of carbon dioxide increase or decrease? A:","completion":"To answer this question, I'll consider the factors that contribute to carbon dioxide levels in both states. Step 1: Examine the situation in Illinois Illinois is adding more factories that use fossil fuels as their main energy source. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. Therefore, the addition of these factories will contribute to increasing CO2 levels in Illinois. Step 2: Examine the situation in Indiana In Indiana, many factories have been shut down and replaced by parks with plants and trees. This change reduces the CO2 emissions from the closed factories. Furthermore, plants and trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere as part of their photosynthesis process, which helps reduce CO2 levels. Step 3: Determine the overall impact Given the increase in CO2 emissions from the new fossil fuel-burning factories in Illinois and the decrease in CO2 emissions from factory closures in Indiana, we need to consider the magnitude of these factors. If the overall increase in CO2 emissions from Illinois is greater than the overall decrease in CO2 emissions and absorption from Indiana's actions, then the combined carbon dioxide levels would increase. The reverse would be true if the decrease in CO2 emissions and absorption in Indiana outweighs the increase in emissions from the Illinois factories. Conclusion: If Illinois adds even more fossil fuel-burning factories without any mitigating actions or adoption of cleaner energy sources, it is likely that the levels of carbon dioxide will increase. However, the specific increase or decrease would depend on the balance between the additions in Illinois and the closures and new parks in Indiana."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

California lags far behind comparable states in funding legal services for the poor, a situation so dire that only 28 percent of the civil legal needs of the state's poor and lowerincome residents are being addressed. That figures translates into 2 million people without the ability to access the justice system, according to a new study by the California Commission on Access to Justice, which also found that despite increased spending, the gap between need and services remains substantial. \\"As a practical matter, in most cases there can be no access to justice without access to legal assistance,\\" said Jack Londen, past commission chair and a partner with Morrison & Foerster in San Francisco. \\"Whether we like it or not, sometimes landlords illegally evict tenants, children with disabilities are denied proper care, veterans don't get services guaranteed to them, and elderly people need legal assistance to escape the abuse of a caregiver.\\" California has the highest number of people in poverty in the nation - 6.4 million, including nearly one in five children. Half the nation's increase in poverty in the 1990s, when the number of poor jumped 30 percent, occurred in California, and nearly 25 percent of the nation's poverty increase occurred in Los Angeles County alone. Even those with jobs are suffering: 26 percent of California workers earn poverty level wages.

How do you say this sentence in English?","completion":"The English translation of the Spanish sentence \\"Tire de la manilla para abrir la puerta\\" would be \\"Pull the handle to open the door\\". Let's break it down for a better understanding of the translation: - 'Tire' is the command form of the Spanish verb 'tirar', which typically means 'to pull' or 'to throw'. In this context, since we're talking about a door handle, 'pull' is the appropriate translation. - 'De' is a preposition that generally means 'of' or 'from'.

The Patriots rebounded from their opening week loss by establishing an early insurmountable lead against the New Orleans Saints in their week 2 matchup. Brandin Cooks returned to the Bayou while the controversy surrounded Saints running backs Adrian Peterson and Mark Ingram (at this point Kamara wasn't part of the argument) over touches. Peterson would later be shipped to the Cardinals in an ironic turn of events for Chris Johnson. Tom Brady completed three first-quarter touchdown passes to Rex Burkhead, Rob Gronkowski, and Chris Hogan. The three touchdowns marked a personal record for Brady, who had never in his career had so many scores in the first quarter of any game. Mike Gillislee added a running touchdown in the second quarter, and the Patriots played a conservative second half to seal the 36-20 victory.
