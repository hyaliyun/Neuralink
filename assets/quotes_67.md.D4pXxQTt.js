Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Jesco White loved to drink and would do it any chance he had.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it cannot be definitively concluded that Jesco White \\"loved to drink and would do it any chance he had.\\" While it is mentioned that he struggled with alcoholism, the statement in question implies intent and enthusiasm in his inclination to drink, which is not explicitly mentioned or supported by the given information. Jesco White's story, as presented in the paragraph, is a complex mix of ambition, personal struggles, and challenging external circumstances. Born in a rural and poverty-stricken region of Appalachia, White was determined to follow in his father's footsteps as a folk dancer and entertainer. While pursuing his dreams, White faced a variety of obstacles, such as depression, drug addiction, and alcoholism. The key issue here is that alcoholism is a disease, and it is not necessarily fair to assume that someone who suffers from alcoholism loves to drink or engages in the activity with a conscious craving or desire. Alcoholism often stems from a complex interplay of genetic, psychological, social, and environmental factors, and can lead to physical and psychological dependence that takes control away from the individual. Instead of making assumptions about Jesco White's intentions or feelings towards alcohol, it is more accurate to focus on the challenges he faced in his life and the impact these challenges had on his pursuit of a dancing career. The documentary films about Jesco White's life likely delve deeper into the various aspects of his personality, experiences, and the challenges he faced, offering a better understanding of the man and his struggles with alcoholism and other issues. In conclusion, while it is known that Jesco White struggled with alcoholism, the statement \\"Jesco White loved to drink and would do it any chance he had\\" is not supported by the given information and may not be an accurate or fair depiction of his relationship with alcohol. It is essential to approach a complex issue like alcoholism with empathy and sensitivity, rather than assuming intent or attributing blame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"(A). There are numerous types of tees available and you can even use a mound of sand but ideally you want the ball leaning slightly forward, to expose the sweet spot, with a seam pointed at your target. Aim to just to the right of the posts. Once you have the ball placed on the tee, follow these steps to kick for goal in rugby: 1. Determine your approach: Every kicker has their own preferred approach for goal kicking. The standard recommendation is to take a few steps back and slightly to the side from the ball. This allows for a proper run-up while maintaining the correct angle for the kick. 2. Focus on your target: Keep your eye on the target, which is usually between the posts and just above the crossbar. Visualize the ball's trajectory through the air and try to focus on where you want the ball to go. 3. Approach the ball: As you begin your run-up to the ball, maintain a balanced and relaxed posture. Your steps should be smooth and controlled, rather than rushed or hurried. 4. Plant your non-kicking foot: As you approach the ball, plant your non-kicking foot firmly on the ground, parallel to the ball and roughly hip-width apart. This provides a stable base for the kick and helps control the direction of your swing. 5. Strike the ball: Swing your kicking leg through smoothly, connecting with the sweet spot of the ball – typically just below its midpoint. Keep your head down and your eyes on the target as you make contact. 6. Follow through: After striking the ball, continue your follow-through. This will help maintain the direction and power of your kick. Keep your eyes on the target until the ball has left your foot. 7. Adjust for wind conditions: If there is a significant wind, you may need to adjust your aim accordingly. For example, if the wind is blowing from left to right, aim slightly left of the posts to compensate. Practice regularly to master the technique and improve your accuracy. Goal kicking is a crucial skill in rugby, as it can often be the difference between winning and losing a match. It is also important to remain mentally focused and manage the pressure, especially in high-stakes games."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It refers to the unintentional release of solid fecal matter when attempting to pass gas. While it isn't a topic that most people would like to discuss or consider the \\"best way\\" to do, I understand that the question may be asked in a humorous context or out of curiosity. So, I will provide a response that emphasizes factors leading to sharting and how to prevent it, instead of focusing on how to do it intentionally. There are several reasons why someone might shart, ranging from dietary factors to health issues. Here are some key factors that could contribute to sharting: 1. Consuming food that irritates the digestive system: Eating spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, or certain types of sugar (such as lactose, if one is lactose intolerant) can irritate the bowels and induce diarrhea or lead to gas production. This can increase the risk of sharting when passing gas. 2. Gastrointestinal illnesses: Infections like gastroenteritis (stomach flu) or food poisoning can cause diarrhea, making it difficult for the individual to control their bowel movements. This increases the likelihood of sharting. 3. Medical conditions: Certain medical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and chronic constipation, can affect the body's ability to control bowel movements, raising the chances of sharting. 4. Overuse of laxatives: Excessive consumption of laxatives can lead to diarrhea or increased bowel movements, making it difficult to distinguish between passing gas and needing to go to the bathroom. Tips to prevent sharting: 1. Monitor your diet: Pay attention to which foods are causing gastrointestinal issues and try to avoid or limit them. 2. Stay hydrated: Drinking enough water can help maintain proper digestion and prevent constipation or diarrhea. 3. Consume fiber: Eating a balanced diet rich in fiber can help promote regular bowel movements and minimize the risks of sharting. 4. Practice good restroom habits: When you feel the urge to pass gas or have a bowel movement, it's important to visit the restroom instead of trying to suppress the urge. 5. Tend to your gut health: Eating probiotics (found in foods like kefir, yogurt, and kimchi) can help maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, improving digestion and reducing the chance of gastrointestinal issues. 6. Consult a healthcare professional: If you are concerned about your bowel habits or experience persistent diarrhea, constipation, or abdominal pain, consult a medical professional for proper guidance and treatment. Of course, sharting is generally an unwanted and embarrassing incident. Focusing on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, paying attention to your body's signals, and being mindful of the factors listed above can help prevent sharting and ensure better gastrointestinal health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the sentence \\"person skateboards\\" is a simplified and minimalistic phrase that does not encompass the entirety of the situation described in the original sentence. Although the sentence \\"person skateboards\\" is true in the sense that it correctly indicates that a person is indeed skateboarding, it fails to capture the full experience and context presented in the originally given sentence. The original sentence provides us with more detailed information. For instance, it tells us that the skateboarder is in the air, suggesting the possibility of a jump or trick being performed. It also provides context to the location, as the skateboarder is flying over a staircase, and the building is described as sleek and contemporary. On the other hand, \\"person skateboards\\" simply states that someone is using a skateboard, without providing any additional context or details. While this minimalistic sentence remains true on a basic level, it does not convey the same depth and meaning as the full sentence it was derived from.

The high school junior was a member of the varsity team in Phoenix. Grief counseling is being offered to students and staff in Phoenix and Homer this weekend. The Executive Director of Section III Athletics, John Rathbun, says coaches and student athletes are very well educated about concussions and head injuries, but nothing could have prepared anyone for what happened on Friday. \\"I don't think anyone could have ever, ever, ever seen this coming. It's just very sad that something like this does happen,\\" said Rathbun. \\"Accidents do happen. You know, you think you're prepared for everything and I think our coaches do a very good job of being aggressive for that next step but in a situation like this, you just never know.\\" To ensure the safety of student athletes, sports equipment is checked on a yearly basic and either refurbished or replaced. He said as far as head injuries go, it is up to each district to come up with its own guidelines. Section III only mandates that students wait seven days before returning to play. Funeral arrangements for Barden have also been finalized: Calling hours will take place Wednesday from 4p.m. to 7p.m. at Foster Funeral Home on Fay Street in Fulton.

Mother of Phoenix Football player to teams: \\"Don't feel guilty\\" PHOENIX , NY (WSYR-TV) - 16-year-old Phoenix High School football player Ridge Barden died Friday after suffering a head injury in a game against Homer High School. On Saturday, Barden’s mother Jacqueline gave us a message to pass along to the players on both teams. She said she does not want anyone to feel the burden of guilt. \\"He just would not want those people to think that it was their fault. It was just an accident. Everything that Ridge did, he did with full gust. I'd say just take that attitude with you,” said Jacqueline Barden. An autopsy was completed Saturday. Results have not yet been announced. Jacqueline Barden said Ridge did not have any pre-existing conditions. Homer Police believe his death is the result of injuries during the game. Jacqueline also gave us some insight into her son’s life on Saturday. She said Ridge was a life-long sports lover. He signed up for little league as soon as he could. Over the years he grew to an intimidating 230 pounds. He was described as a beast on the football circuit and a gentle giant off the field. To his mom, he'll always just be her little boy. \\"It still is shocking. He's with us and he's gone,” said Jacqueline Barden. Snapshots from his 16th birthday last month show a kid with dreams for the future, maybe becoming an engineer someday. Instead, his # 70 jersey was surrounded by friends when he collapsed after the final play of his short life in a game that he loved. Dozens of shocked teammates and neighbors turned to memorial pages online to share grief and support. \\"It helps to know that even though there is a lot of bad out there, there is still good, that people do still care about their neighbors,” said Jacqueline Barden. Barden's father was too emotional to speak but offered us this statement: \\"I have no words right now. My world has been devastated.

It was on the Homer High School football field where Barden suffered a head injury during Friday night's game. He was rushed to the hospital but would not survive. Police in Homer continue their investigation Saturday while the school district takes care of players and coaches who watched everything unfold. Within two minutes of his collapse, safety teams rushed in to help Barden. He was carried from the field on a stretcher. Homer High School opened its doors by 8a.m. Saturday morning, with grief counselors available to anyone who needed to talk. The district is cooperating with Homer Police, which happened to be on the scene Friday for routine crowd control at the game. An officer says they will make sure the proper safety equipment and procedures were used as part of their investigation. As of now, police and school officials say there is no early indication of wrongdoing and they offered words of support to Barden's teammates and friends. \\"The loss of a young one is devastating to anyone who is involved and we just grieve with the Phoenix school community and can't imagine what they are going through,\\" said Homer School Superintendent Nancy Ruscio. \\"This has got to be very heartbreaking for them. This is quite a tragedy. Especially during a sports event to have something like this happen. We want to offer our condolensces to them. We're very sorry that this happened,\\" said Homer Police Officer Donald Warner. Police tell us the response time was quick and it does not appear that emergency responders could have done anything differently. The family did say it thinks this was simply an accident. Autopsy results are expected Saturday night. ||||| A teen athlete who collapsed at a football game in Phoenix, N.Y., died of bleeding in the brain unleashed by forceful bodily contact on the field, according to an autopsy released today. Ridge Barden, 16, toppled onto the field Friday during the third quarter of the game between his Phoenix High School and Homer High School, reported ABC's Syracuse, N.Y., affiliate, WSYR-TV, which has read the autopsy report. It is not been officially released. \\"It's still shocking. He was with us and now he's gone,\\" his mother, Jacqueline Barden, told WSYR-TV. Her 230-pound, sports-loving son's accidental death, nonetheless, amplifies the acknowledged challenges of safeguarding the health of student athletes nationwide. Head injuries have attracted a singular attention, with New York State lawmakers, for example, this year approving a Concussion Management Awareness Act. For every school district, it mandates concussion management teams comprised of sports staff, health and other professionals. The Florida High School Athletics Association, as another example, has ordered new rules aimed at keeping athletes suspected of having endured a concussion from returning to play without a doctor's formal clearance. Members of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, by law, must implement policies to minimize brain injuries, including concussion awareness training. Barden said her child, who had been playing sports since Little League, had no pre-existing medical problems. Stunned by his collapse, the lineman's teammates encircled him as soon after he fell onto the field, following what The Associated Press reported as an especially hard hit by one of his team's opponents. Trainers and coaches rushed over to find him talking, able to roll over on his back by himself and sit up, said Phoenix School District Superintendent Judy Belfield. Still, he complained of a severe headache and buckled again when he tried to stand, she said. An outpouring of grief, condolences and support for his family has spread online. \\"R.I.P.

John's company committed to decrease greenhouse gas production worldwide. What likely happens to the global temperature in the future as a result it will increase or it will decrease? Answer:","completion":"Based on the passage provided, it can be concluded that as John's company commits to decreasing greenhouse gas production worldwide, it is likely that the global temperature will decrease in the future. This is because a decrease in greenhouse gas levels has been directly connected to a decrease in global temperatures, while an increase in greenhouse gas levels raises global temperatures. As John's company is working towards lessening greenhouse gas production, it will consequently contribute to a reduction in the overall amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, are responsible for trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to the well-known phenomenon of global warming. By removing or reducing these heat-trapping gases, it becomes possible to lower the Earth's temperatures. Therefore, given that John's company is actively committed to decreasing greenhouse gas production on a global scale, the expected outcome in the future would be a decrease in global temperature. This is backed up by the information provided in the passage, which establishes a clear correlation between decreasing greenhouse gas levels and a corresponding decrease in global temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation. \\"The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,\\" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery. The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are \\"extremely difficult, if not impossible\\" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said. The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face. The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants, Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue. Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers. Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant.

I told my family that I was going to go find a port-a-pot. So I head off by myself. I’m in the port-a-pot, i’m in there for roughly 10 minutes. (you can assume what I was doing) I wash my hands and get ready to leave the port-a-pot, and I tried to open the door and it was locked. I’m claustrophobic, so I start to FREAK OUT. I started banging on the door, running into the door with all of my weight. Nothing was helping. I then start crying, I thought for sure that I was going to die. I knew it was the end, at the age of 14, locked in a port-a-pot, in 95 degree weather in the middle of a beach in Georgia. Looking back, i’m curious as to why my family never came to look for me, I was gone for like 30 minutes. So I’m banging on the door continuously, bawling my eyes out. Then a man opened the door for me, from the outside. He was about 6’3 with dreads about 12 inches long and weighed about 280 pounds. I ran out of the port-a-pot and jumped on the guy and gave him a hug and told him that I loved him and that he saved my life. I don’t know how he managed to open the door for me, but I definitely know that my 14 year old self owes that man my life. I’m not sure where he is in life, or what he’s doing, but I hope God is blessing him abundantly. It is definitely a funny story to tell my friends.

Both the civilian mariners, and the merchant vessels, are managed by a combination of the government and private sectors, and engage in commerce or transportation of goods and services in and out of the navigable waters of the United States. The Merchant Marine primarily transports cargo and passengers during peacetime; in times of war, the Merchant Marine can be an auxiliary to the United States Navy, and can be called upon to deliver military personnel and materiel for the military. Merchant Marine officers may also be commissioned as military officers by the Department of Defense. This is commonly achieved by commissioning unlimited tonnage Merchant Marine officers as Strategic Sealift Officers in the Naval Reserves. - USTS Empire State V , was a troop ship of the US Navy and training vessel of the United States Maritime Service .

The fort was named in honor of Major General Philip Schuyler of the Continental Army. - The United States Maritime Service (USMS) was established in 1938 under the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. The mission of the organization is to train people to become officers and crewmembers on merchant ships that form the United States Merchant Marine per Title 46 U.S. Code 51701. Heavily utilized during World War II, the USMS has since been largely dissolved and/or absorbed into other federal departments, but its commissioned officers continue to function as administrators and instructors at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the several maritime academies. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities.

But it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely: That the strategy to promote \\"gun rights\\" for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the KKK flourish.

This is a correct answer to the following question about Cake. Yes or no? Answer: Cakes are often filled with fruit preserves or dessert sauces (like pastry cream ), iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan , piped borders or candied fruit. Question: how does egg substitute effect the cake if u put in","completion":"To answer the question \\"How does egg substitute affect the cake if you put it in?\\", I will consider several factors related to cake ingredients and the function of eggs in cakes. Step 1: Understand the role of eggs in cakes Eggs are a fundamental ingredient in many cake recipes, as they provide structure, moisture, and leavening. Moreover, proteins in eggs contribute to cake texture and emulsification, while the fats in egg yolks create richness and flavor. Step 2: Recognize the differences in egg substitutes Egg substitutes are often derived from plant-based sources or other ingredients like tofu or various starches. These substitutes are utilized for various reasons such as allergies, vegan lifestyles, or dietary restrictions. Step 3: Evaluate the implications of egg substitutes in cakes When using egg substitutes in a cake recipe, it is essential to consider the specific substitute's properties. Some egg substitutes maintain similar characteristics to eggs, providing leavening, structure, and moisture. On the other hand, others might have differences in texture and taste that could slightly alter the cake's resulting outcome. Step 4: Construct the response In conclusion, the effect of egg substitutes on cake varies depending on the specific egg substitute used. Generally, egg substitutes can effectively replace eggs in cakes while maintaining similar properties, such as structure, moisture, and leavening. However, there might be slight variations in taste and texture, depending on the chosen substitute. Therefore, the final answer to the question is: \\"Egg substitutes can affect the cake depending on the specific substitute, sometimes causing minor changes in taste and texture, but overall maintaining the cake's structure and consistency.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Once you have learned how to calculate your net carb intake you need to actually track how much you are consuming to make sure you stick to the Atkins plan. There are a number of different techniques and technologies that can help you to do this. One good option is to download a carb counting app onto your smartphone. It has the advantages of being portable and something you keep with you all day. Depending on the app you can also track other nutritional information. It will do some of the calculations for you and give you a clear and up-to-date count of your net carb consumption. Another digital option is to download a tracker onto your PC or laptop. Like the app this will do a lot of the calculating for you and is likely to contain a variety of other features to help you monitor what you eat more fully. Using one of these programs can often help you to gain a fuller picture of your diet. Unlike a smartphone app, it is not something you will carry around with you all day, so you won’t be able to keep it completely up-to-date during the day. A nice low tech version is simply to write down your net carb intake by hand as you go through the day. You could buy a special notebook and keep it with you.

Article: How is it that siblings can turn out so differently? One answer is that in fact each sibling grows up in a different family. The firstborn is, for a while, an only child, and therefore has a completely different experience of the parents than those born later. The next child is, for a while, the youngest, until the situation is changed by a new arrival. The mother and father themselves are changing and growing up too. One sibling might live in a stable and close family in the first few years; another might be raised in a family crisis, with a disappointed mother or an angry father. Sibling competition was identified as an important shaping force as early as in 1918. But more recently, researchers have found many ways in which brothers and sisters are a lasting force in each others' lives. Dr. Annette Henderson says firstborn children pick up vocabulary more quickly than their siblings. The reason for this might be that the later children aren't getting the same one-on-one time with parents. But that doesn't mean that the younger children have problems with language development. Later-borns don't enjoy that much talking time with parents, but instead they harvest lessons from bigger brothers and sisters, learning entire phrases and getting an understanding of social concepts such as the difference between \\"I\\" and \\"me\\". A Cambridge University study of 140 children found that siblings created a rich world of play that helped them grow socially. Love-hate relationships were common among the children. Even those siblings who fought the most had just as much positive communication as the other sibling pairs. One way children seek more attention from parents is by making themselves different from their siblings, particularly if they are close in age. Researchers have found that the first two children in a family are typically more different from each other than the second and third. Girls with brothers show their differences to a maximum degree by being more feminine than girls with sisters. A 2003 research paper... Question: The word \\"feminine\\" (in Para. 4) means \\" _ \\".

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on... Question: How long ago did Trump probably pay Cohen 130,000?

It's not me.\\" can be translated as \\"Je to jenom... to nejsem já.\\" Here's a breakdown of the Czech phrase for better understanding: 1. 'Je to' (it is) – 'Je' implies 'it is' and 'to' translates to 'it'. Together, they stand for the English phrase \\"it's\\". 2. 'jenom' (just) – 'jenom' is an adverb, which means 'just' or 'only' in English. It is used the same way as the word 'just' in the original phrase, So, \\"It's just\\" can be translated to \\"Je to jenom.\\" 3. 'to nejsem já' (it's not me) – This part of the phrase consists of three words. 'To' translates to 'it'. 'Nejsem' is a combination of two words, 'ne' (meaning 'not') and 'jsem' (meaning 'I am'). 'Já' translates to 'me' or 'I' in English. Putting them together, we get \\"to nejsem já,\\" which means \\"it's not me\\" in English. So, the complete translation of \\"It's just...

A better, detailed, and long answer to this question would be: The North American cougar and Asian elephant have been extensively hunted throughout history for different reasons. Hunting practices, in combination with other factors such as habitat destruction, have led to a decline in their populations and, in some cases, endangerment. The North American cougar, also known as the mountain lion or puma, was once found from coast to coast in North America. As European settlements expanded, cougars were hunted extensively due to the perceived threat they posed to livestock. Bounties were placed on them, resulting in the indiscriminate and widespread killing of these animals. Cougars were also hunted for sport, which further contributed to the reduction in their numbers. However, at present, cougars are listed as a species of \\"least concern\\" on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species, primarily due to the fact that their range is still relatively large. Conservation measures have been implemented in certain areas with the aim of protecting and increasing cougar populations. On the other hand, the Asian elephant, native to Southeast Asia, has been hunted for various purposes, including their valuable ivory tusks, which are a highly sought-after commodity, especially in the black market. Elephants have also been hunted for their meat, hides, and bones. In addition to hunting, elephants are often captured for use in human entertainment or for labor, which negatively impacts wild populations. Habitat loss due to deforestation and agricultural expansion has also contributed to the decline of the Asian elephant population. Currently, the Asian elephant is classified as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. Numerous conservation efforts, such as protecting key habitats, reducing human-elephant conflicts, and curbing illegal ivory trade, are being conducted to help stabilize and increase elephant populations. In conclusion, although the statement mentions endangerment or extinction, it lacks specific information on how both the North American cougar and Asian elephant have been hunted and the reasons behind the decline in their populations. A more accurate and comprehensive answer should address these differences and the various factors affecting their respective conservation statuses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By increasing the power frequency to 400 Hz, transformers and motors can be much smaller and lighter than at 50 or 60 Hz, which is an advantage in aircrafts, submarines, spacecrafts, and other military equipment, as well as hand-held tools. To better understand this concept, it is essential to know the basics of electrical power and its frequency. Electrical power is the product of voltage and current and is measured in watts. It is the energy that is transferred through electrical devices, such as motors, transformers, and other equipment that convert electrical energy efficiently to perform useful work. Electrical power frequency refers to the number of cycles per second at which the voltage and current in an alternating current (AC) electrical system change direction. This frequency is measured in hertz (Hz), and the standard frequencies used in power systems worldwide are 50 Hz or 60 Hz. The choice of the power frequency depends on various factors, such as the design of electrical equipment and historical reasons. However, in certain specialized applications like aircraft, submarines, spacecraft, and other military equipment, as well as hand-held tools, a power frequency of 400 Hz is used. The reason is that increasing the frequency to 400 Hz offers significant advantages in terms of size, weight, and efficiency of electrical components such as transformers and motors. Transformers are electrical devices that transfer electrical power from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction. By increasing the power frequency, transformers can be designed to be smaller and lighter while maintaining the same power-handling capacity. This is due to the fact that the magnetic materials' required volume in the transformer core decreases as the frequency increases. Smaller and lighter transformers are more suited to applications that require mobility, such as aircraft, submarines, and spacecraft. Similarly, motors also benefit from higher frequencies. Motors comprise magnetic materials and electric windings, and an increase in the operating frequency results in reduced size and weight of these components. At higher frequencies, it is also possible to use higher synchronous speeds, which improves power-to-weight ratios and reduces motor inertia. In addition, higher frequencies may lead to increased efficiency in motor operation due to reduced core losses. In conclusion, the use of a 400 Hz power frequency in applications such as aircraft, submarines, spacecraft, military equipment, and hand-held tools allows for smaller, lighter, and more efficient designs of transformers and motors. This results in better performance, reduced size and weight, and improved energy efficiency, meeting the unique requirements of these specialized applications."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: Who wanted to kill Jerry?

Movie title: The Mexican Context: The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find a valuable antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival. Panicked but determined, Jerry buries the body and then calls Bernie to report on the situation, only for his vehicle to be stolen while he makes the call, the gun still inside. Jerry briefly has an uncooperative donkey as transportation to follow the thief, then buys an old, damaged truck. Meanwhile, Samantha gets kidnapped by a hit man named Leroy (James Gandolfini), who tells her that Jerry hired him to make sure she is safe from anybody that wants her dead. It is then revealed that Leroy is gay, which doesn't bother Samantha. They pick up a postal worker named Frank (Michael Cerveris), who then has a relationship with Leroy.

A couple of weeks ago, AOL threw its freelance journalists into purgatory: They were supposed to sit tight and wait to hear from their editors on their roles in the post-merger Huffington Post Media Group. The freelancers, naturally, assumed that this meant they were about to get canned. And this suspicion, it appears, was correct. Here's a note from one: Well, it's official: The Huffington Post Transition team has just eliminated all AOL freelancers and contractors (at least those in business and finance--everything under Peter Goodman). But we have been invited to continue contributing for free. We will be replaced either by a handful of people Goodman has in mind, or with young, new (read cheap) writers who have yet to be hired. We've been told that all these new, full-time employees will be expected to report to the office every day for a 40-hour work week. For some reason, it's very important to Arianna [Huffington] to have writers physically working in a newsroom in either LA, New York or Washington, DC, thus going back to an archaic newsroom model that went out with the invention of the telephone, and needlessly eliminating any talented writers in other parts of the country. So much for a global, cutting edge news team. The entire communications stream has been extremely unprofessional. Writers have been given conflicting and inaccurate information from their managers since the transition began, and this is mostly because managers have been given inaccurate and intentionally misleading information by the Huffington Post transition team. AOL managers have been kept in the dark and have not been made aware of the \\"new direction\\" they've been told to take. They basically have no idea as to who will be creating content for them, and what content is expected. The entire transition process has been schizophrenic -- we were told that they would not be rushing into anything, but that the process would be completed in three weeks. We were also told that everything would be handled on a case by case basis, and then we were all let go, no exceptions made, on one day. I hate to see what this portends for journalism in general. Arianna has taken the \\"Free Content\\" model just too far, and for some odd reason, harkened back to the 20th century. AOL had indeed assembled an excellent group of freelancers, and on their behalf, we're certainly sorry to hear this news. For what it's worth, we do understand Arianna's desire to have most folks working in the newsroom. The freelance model is often challenging in this medium because of the need to produce content in real-time and respond instantly to news. Huffington Post has also hired some extremely expensive full-time editors and writers lately, so this isn't all about replacing expensive folks with cheap ones. But it sounds as though, in this battle, the Huffington folks have won out. (And at the rate the transition is happening, there soon won't be anyone but Huffpo folks left. The team at Engadget, one of AOL's most successful pre-Huffpo brands, just quit to start a competing site at SB Nation.) UPDATE: AOL's business-and-finance editor Peter Goodman says it is not true that AOL has fired all its freelancers. Peter says the company is hiring some of them full time.

By Nisa Islam Muhammad -Staff Writer- | Last updated: Apr 3, 2011 - 10:48:40 PM What's your opinion on this article? Printer Friendly Page (FinalCall.com) - The recent sale of the online news site Huffington Post to AOL for 315 million was good news to founder Arianna Huffi ngton but a slap in the face to writers and bloggers who contribute content to the site for free. Many are now upset, feeling used and abused. Visual Art Source, which has art galleries around the country and provided free content, has started a strike against the company. “We shall remain on strike until these two demands are met. First, a pay schedule must be proposed and steps initiated to implement it for all contributing writers and bloggers. Second, paid promotional material must no longer be posted alongside editorial content; a press release or exhibition catalogue essay is fundamentally different from editorial content and must be either segregated and indicated as such, or not published at all,” wrote Bill Lasarow, editor and publisher. More than 50 writers initially joined the strike—but more strikers are being recruited. “I am also calling upon all others now contributing free content, particularly original content to the Huffington Post to also join us in this strike,” said Mr. Lasarow. “We think it is incumbent upon the many writers and bloggers to form a negotiating partnership with Huffington/AOL in order to pursue these and other important matters so as to professionalize this relationship. It is not entirely Ms. Huffi ngton's fault that so many talented professionals have been willing to accept the company's terms on an ‘in kind', basis.” On March 16, the Newspaper Guild, a 26,000 member strong national union of media workers, joined the strike and electronic boycott. “The Newspaper Guild is calling on unpaid writers of the Huffi ngton Post to withhold their work in support of a strike launched by Visual Art Source in response to the company's practice of using unpaid labor. In addition, we are asking that our members and all supporters of fair and equitable compensation for journalists join us in shining a light on the unprofessional and unethical practices of this company. Just as we would ask writers to stand fast and not cross a physical picket line, we ask that they honor this electronic picket line,” said the Newspaper Guild. As Cherie Turner, a former Huffington Post writer, said, “Certainly, we all have written for free for the great exposure the Huffi ngton Post can give us, but what's the cost? Those of us on strike feel it undermines the value of our profession and is unethical, especially in light of great profi ts by those at the top. We are only asking for a fair share of what we are helping to create.” The online HuffingtonPost.com made its mark as a popular progressive website and hub for articles, opinion pieces and other features that were often outside of mainstream media and an alternative to news and opinion from the political right. ||||| Earlier today, we published a note from an AOL freelance journalist reporting that AOL's business-and-finance freelancers had been canned. AOL's business-and-finance editor Peter Goodman sent us the note below in response. Peter says that AOL's business-and-finance freelancers have not all been canned: Some of them are being hired into full-time jobs. Otherwise, Peter's take is basically the same as that of the freelancer who sent us the note: AOL is moving away from freelancers toward full-time staff (which is understandably distressing to some freelancers). Peter's note just emphasizes the positive view of this transition--the reasons AOL is doing what it is doing, and why they make sense. (We agree with those reasons, by the way, as we said earlier). Here's Peter's note: While we much appreciate your interest in the many exciting happenings here at the Huffington Post Media Group inside AOL, your item this morning reporting a mass termination of freelancers staffing AOL's business and finance sites is simply false. No such communication has gone out. In fact, we have been hiring many freelancers into full-time jobs and will continue to do so in the weeks to come. Worse, is the implication in your post that we are replacing high-paid veterans with inexperienced writers in order to cut cost. We have been investing aggressively in building a modern newsroom at our headquarters here in New York, and I would delighted to show you around anytime you like. One simple walk across the newsroom floor should quickly dispel any sense that we are diminishing scope and ambition, or opting for penny-pinching mode. [To clarify, we did not say AOL was cutting costs. In fact, we pointed out that AOL had paid astronomical salaries for some top-notch folks and that we agreed with the full-time vs freelance transition.] We have been bringing in dozens of highly talented and, in many cases, deeply experienced writers and editors to staff our sections, and this is a process that has only begun. As someone who has worked for two decades inside traditional newspaper newsrooms -- all of them now figuring out how to make do with fewer people -- it is genuinely exciting to be building out this increasingly teeming place. It is true that we are shifting from relying on freelancers and contractors to investing in full-time staff. We feel this gives everyone greater security and a shared mission. And we do want people right here in the newsroom, to participate in the sorts of spontaneous conversations that often yield the best ideas. This is something about which we are unabashed and even proud: We are assembling a first-rate group of full-time staff to take us forward. In many cases, we have been hiring people who have previously been freelancers into these full-time jobs. And, in some cases where geographic reach is needed (for example, autos coverage in Detroit), we are keeping people in place beyond the company's core offices in New York, Washington, and Los Angeles. In many instances we are directing the freelance budget in its entirety to hiring the best staff people. This is not about cost savings; it's about aiming for journalistic excellence, and having on hand the most dedicated, talented and highly motivated group of people in our midst to pursue that goal. Finally, I want to take on directly this persistent idea that people who have been paid to write and report will be replaced by people who write for free. This is simply not true. We are, again, transitioning from paying people to write under freelance contracts to people paid to write on a full-time staff basis. At the same time, we will continue to embrace the contributions of a wholly different group of people -- our enormous, diverse, vibrant community of bloggers. These are people who are free to write or not write as they choose. We own no claim on their time, or guarantee on production. We rely on their insights, their expertise and their entertainment value, and they ride our platform to promote their books, advance their causes, and reach a bigger audience with their ideas. This has been a productive relationship for many -- not least, our swiftly growing readership -- and it will continue and expand across the AOL sites that are now part of our shared Huffington Post Media Group Enterprise. But the blogging component will not replace the work of hired, professional journalists who write for us as members of our staf. Thanks very much for allowing me to clarify this, and please don't hesitate to take me up on an offer for a tour. Best wishes, Peter Goodman See Also: AOL Freelancer Says AOL Has Fired Freelancers |||||Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the transition of AOL towards replacing freelancers with full-time staff writers after the merger with the Huffington Post Media Group. Freelancers were left waiting to hear from their editors about their roles after the merger, which led many to assume they would be ultimately let go. This suspicion was confirmed when AOL eliminated all of its freelancers and contractors in business and finance, inviting them to continue contributing for free. The change is meant to bring in young, new, and cost-effective writers to replace the experienced freelancers. As part of this transition, AOL has emphasized the importance of having writers physically working in a newsroom in either Los Angeles, New York, or Washington, DC, and has displayed unprofessionalism and conflicting information during the transition process. However, not all hope is lost for the freelancers as AOL's business-and-finance editor, Peter Goodman, emphasizes that they are hiring some freelancers into full-time positions. The transition is not about cost savings, but rather about aiming for journalistic excellence and ensuring that talented, dedicated, and highly motivated people are available for the newsroom. Although the AOL freelancers may see this change as a loss, this transition could ultimately be beneficial for the company as it focuses on expanding and excelling in its journalistic endeavors. With the new Huffington Post Media Group as part of AOL, the company is working towards achieving greater efficiency and relevance in the ever-evolving world of digital journalism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Games Like Fruit Ninja - Not Facebook - Get Worst Grades On App Privacy One million Android apps have been indexed and graded as part of a landmark study into how much each one invades user privacy. Among the big offenders: mobile games like Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds and Despicable Me – apps that are often incidentally, used by kids. The best behaved A-grade players are social media bigwigs that get flak for their approach privacy: Facebook, Google Maps, YouTube and WhatsApp. A team of researchers at Carnegie Mellon University put together the PrivacyGrade database, after helping the Federal Trade Commission weed out and fine Brightest Flashlight in December 2013, a popular Android app that was secretly sharing users’ location data with advertisers. Their database lists the third-party “libraries” which most apps use. Libraries are pieces of code provided by ad networks like InMobi, Twitter’s MoPub, Facebook and Google Analytics, which app makers install and reuse. It’s the quickest and most popular way to build apps these days – akin to putting Lego blocks together rather than building everything from scratch. Yet libraries are also responsible for the most sensitive data requests made by apps like Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds. Lead researcher Jason Hong and his team trawled 1 million apps on Google Play and created a model that predicted people’s expectations for each one and the gap with the app’s actual behavior. For instance, their studies showed that most people didn’t expect Fruit Ninja to collect their location data, but they did expect Google Maps to do so. The gap of expectation led to a lower grade for Fruit Ninja. “In some of our past research people were ok with ads and their data being used for advertising purposes,” Hong said in an interview, “but only if they were aware with what’s going on. When they don’t, it’s a problem.” The FTC is overwhelmed by the number of apps, website and hardware it needs to regulate, says Hong, and the problem is made worse by the fact that app developers often don’t realize how much user data they’re siphoning away to advertisers (not so surprising since ads are their main meal ticket). Ad networks rely on apps to gather as much detail as possible about users to create a composite profile, to be targeted with ads. “We talked to many app developers and many don’t know the full extent of what these libraries are doing,” Hong said. Apps can do this in the most innocuous ways. Last month Twitter announced it was giving away new back-end tools for developers that would (it hoped) get them installing libraries for its mobile ad network MoPub. One of those tools collected app users’ phone numbers. End users also often aren’t aware of what’s happening with the data they share. While they might be ok with driving navigation app Waze collecting location data, for instance, many won’t know that the app also shares their anonymized location data with local governments. Hong recommends that the FTC invest in better tools to detect privacy problems and scale up what its lawyers manually do today. The National Institute of Standards and Technology should also start holding conferences that teach best practices on privacy to developers, he says. The most egregious offenders should get a slap on the wrist to set the tone, he adds, and there should be clearer rules for advertisers to follow. “App developers should have better tools and ways of conveying what’s going on,” Hong said. ”Advertisement by itself isn’t necessarily bad, but the way it’s done now which is surreptitious and surprising to people – that’s bad.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A study by Carnegie Mellon University has found that popular mobile games like Fruit Ninja, Angry Birds, and Despicable Me have some of the worst privacy ratings among Android apps, primarily due to third-party libraries used for advertising. Meanwhile, social media platforms like Facebook, Google Maps, YouTube, and WhatsApp received better privacy ratings despite often being criticized for their approach to user privacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In terms of syntax, the sentence follows the structure of an imperative sentence, which is used to give commands or make requests. The constituents of the sentence are a main verb \\"make,\\" a reflexive pronoun \\"yourself,\\" and an adjective \\"comfortable.\\" The word order of this sentence is correct for an English imperative sentence. \\"Make\\" is functioning as the verb, directing the action. \\"Yourself\\" is a reflexive pronoun, and it is used correctly here. Reflexive pronouns are used when the object of the verb is the same as the subject, meaning that someone is performing an action on themselves. In this case, \\"yourself\\" refers to the listener performing the action of making themselves comfortable. \\"Comfortable\\" is an adjective that describes the state that the listener is being asked to achieve. In this context, it means that the speaker is urging the listener to settle into a relaxed and cozy position. Semantically, the sentence is also acceptable and understandable. It conveys a clear idea: the speaker is requesting the listener to adjust their situation to feel at ease and relaxed. This is a common expression used in various contexts, such as when inviting someone into a home or office, or suggesting that a person settle into a chair or couch for conversation or relaxation.

Here is a question about this article: Early progress toward the development of vaccines occurred throughout this period, primarily in the form of academic and government-funded basic research directed toward the identification of the pathogens responsible for common communicable diseases. In 1885 Louis Pasteur and Pierre Paul Émile Roux created the first rabies vaccine. The first diphtheria vaccines were produced in 1914 from a mixture of diphtheria toxin and antitoxin (produced from the serum of an inoculated animal), but the safety of the inoculation was marginal and it was not widely used. The United States recorded 206,000 cases of diphtheria in 1921 resulting in 15,520 deaths. In 1923 parallel efforts by Gaston Ramon at the Pasteur Institute and Alexander Glenny at the Wellcome Research Laboratories (later part of GlaxoSmithKline) led to the discovery that a safer vaccine could be produced by treating diphtheria toxin with formaldehyde. In 1944, Maurice Hilleman of Squibb Pharmaceuticals developed the first vaccine against Japanese encephelitis.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What people usually have a library and museum as their largest commemorative memorials? ? Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles. Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate. Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several Presidential...

Answer the above question based on the context below: After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea. Answer:","completion":"The full name of the birds that wintered together is the Northern Bald Ibis (Geronticus eremita). In the context provided, four adult Northern Bald Ibises were found to winter together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia after being satellite-tagged in Syria in 2006."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Decorate your fish tank. Use a filtration system. Add conditioned water.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: A Guide to Setting Up and Decorating the Perfect Fish Tank Introduction: The joys of owning an aquarium are endless, as countless fish enthusiasts can attest. Creating a miniature aquatic ecosystem provides not only therapeutic benefits but also serves as an eye-catching addition to any living space. However, setting up a fish tank involves more than simply pouring water into a container and adding some fish. In this article, we'll outline the essential steps to establish a thriving and well-decorated haven for your aquatic friends. Step 1: Consider the Size of Your Fish Tank Before diving into decorations and aquatic life, it's crucial to determine the appropriate size for your fish tank. Consider the number of fish you plan to house, as well as their potential size upon reaching adulthood. Be sure to research each species' requirements and preferences, as every fish has unique needs. Additionally, think about the space available in your home to ensure the tank fits seamlessly within your environment. Larger tanks can support more fish and provide them with ample room to swim, while smaller tanks restrict their available space and may lead to conflict among tank mates. As a general rule, allocate one gallon of water per inch of adult fish length, taking into account their adult size. Step 2: Decorate Your Fish Tank Once you've chosen the ideal tank size, it's time to get creative with decorations. Decorating your fish tank not only enhances its visual appeal but also provides essential hiding spots, territories, and stimulation for your fish. Consider incorporating a mix of functional and aesthetic decorations: - Live or artificial plants: Plants offer natural shelter and hiding spots for fish, fostering a sense of security and well-being. Live plants also contribute to water filtration. - Rocks and driftwood: These natural elements provide intriguing territories for fish to explore, as well as additional hiding spots. - Ornaments and structures: Adding visually captivating pieces such as sunken ships, bridges, and tunnels will enhance the personality of your tank, offering the perfect finishing touch. Ensure that all decorations are safe for your fish and compatible with their species' needs, and avoid overcrowding to give them space to swim freely. Step 3: Use a Filtration System A healthy fish tank requires proper filtration to maintain water quality, prevent ammonia buildup, and reduce stress on your aquatic friends. There are three types of filtration to consider: - Mechanical: Removes debris and solid waste through sponges, foam pads, or filter floss. - Biological: Supports beneficial bacteria growth, contributing to the nitrogen cycle and breaking down harmful waste. - Chemical: Utilizes activated carbon or other chemical media to adsorb odors, discoloration, and contaminants from the water. Choose a filtration system suitable for your tank size and the needs of your fish species. Step 4: Add Conditioned Water Tap water often contains chlorine, chloramines, and heavy metals, which can adversely affect your fish and the beneficial bacteria in your tank. Adding dechlorinated, conditioned water is essential to maintaining a healthy aquatic environment. Use a water conditioner according to the manufacturer's instructions to neutralize harmful substances, creating a safe living space for your aquatic pets. Conclusion: Setting up a fish tank may appear daunting at first, but with proper consideration and care, you'll soon enjoy the tranquil beauty and satisfaction that come from bringing your very own aquatic ecosystem to life. Following these steps will ensure your fish thrive and live their best lives within their personalized aquatic paradise. Happy fish keeping!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Amongst the crowd, there are friends and family members who loudly cheer for their loved ones, offering words of encouragement and capturing the moment on their phones and cameras. Despite the numerous tumbles, some surfers successfully manage to ride the waves momentarily, displaying impressive stunts and garnering applause from the spectators.

What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work. Generally, they started off with an enormous paper sack of potatoes, about 25 pounds or so (We used to buy potatoes by the cartload and store them in a wooden bin in the basement. Because we were cheap labour, the kids would be sent down to retrieve a few for the family meal. It was creepy to descend into the dank cellar, feel our way through the dim obstacle course formed by my grandfather's thousands of tools and bits of wood and locate the bin.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 0 = 58*m - 54*m + 16 for m.","completion":"Okay little buddy, let's solve this step by step! We have this equation: 0 = 58*m - 54*m + 16. First, we'll start by combining the terms with \\"m\\" in them. So we have 58 of them and we're going to take away 54 of them. That's like having 58 candies and giving 54 of them away. How many candies would you have left? That's right, 4 candies! So now the equation looks like this: 0 = 4*m + 16. Next, we're gonna need to get rid of the \\"+16\\" part to find out what 'm' is. To do that, we will subtract 16 from both sides of the equation. So it will be like taking away 16 toys from one side, and also from the other side to make it fair. Then the equation will look like this: -16 = 4*m. Now, we need to find out how many times 4 can go into -16. Imagine, if you gave away 4 toys each day, how many days would it take to give away 16 toys? That would take 4 days, right? But since we're dealing with -16, it means that it will take -4 days to go back in time in our little game. So, m = -4. And that's it! We found that m equals -4. Good job solving the problem together!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What is the ping sent from a spam blog called? Possible A: ham, splurp, sping, splog, blam Why is \\"sping\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"\\"Sping\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense when considering the context of the question and the possible answers provided, because it closely relates to the terminology and concepts surrounding spam blogs and internet activity. To understand this better, let's analyze the context and components of the question: - The question is about a \\"ping\\" sent from a \\"spam blog\\". - A \\"ping\\" in this context refers to a signal or message transmitted over a network, typically used to check the availability of a server or the presence of a device connected to the internet. - A \\"spam blog\\" is a type of blog that is created to promote and disseminate spam content, often for unscrupulous marketing purposes. Now let us analyze the possible answers provided: A: ham, splurp, sping, splog, blam 1. Ham: In the context of emails and online communication, \\"ham\\" refers to legitimate, non-spam messages. Thus, it is not associated with spam blogs and their activities, which makes it an unlikely choice. 2. Splurp: This term has no clear association with spam blogs or internet pinging. It appears to be a made-up term and has no direct relevance to the context of the question. 3. Sping: This term is a portmanteau of \\"spam\\" and \\"ping\\", which immediately suggests a connection with the original question, as it refers to a ping sent from a spam blog. This option closely relates to the terminology and concepts involved in the question, making it a logical and reasonable choice for an answer. 4. Splog: A \\"splog\\" is another term for a spam blog, which, although related, does not accurately describe the ping sent from a spam blog. Instead, it refers to the blog itself rather than the activity being carried out. 5. Blam: Similar to \\"splurp\\", this term has no clear association with either pinging or spam blogs. It appears to be unrelated to the context of the question and lacks direct relevance. When weighing the different possible answers, \\"sping\\" emerges as the most suitable choice based on human common sense, as it combines the relevant terms, \\"spam\\" and \\"ping\\". This creates a word that accurately conveys the concept of a ping sent from a spam blog. The other options either lack direct relevance to the context or describe different aspects that are not related to the specific activity inquired about in the question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kevin invited Derrick in to make tej with them, because Derrick was younger and learned their family traditions. Growing up, Derrick had always been keen to understand and cherish the customs of his heritage, and Kevin knew that making tej together would provide the perfect opportunity for them both to bond while preserving these valuable customs. Tej, a traditional Ethiopian honey wine, held a special place in their family's history – it had been a central part of numerous celebrations and gatherings. As they prepared the ingredients and equipment necessary to make tej, Kevin appreciated the enthusiasm and curiosity that Derrick brought to the process. It reminded him of their grandparents who had passed on their knowledge of tej-making to the younger generations, keeping the art alive throughout the years. Together, the pair discussed various aspects of their family's customs – from the importance of tej within Ethiopian culture to its role within their own family dynamics. As they worked side by side, Kevin imparted his experience to Derrick, sharing tips and tricks he had acquired over the years. He was grateful for the chance to bond with his younger family member over this shared activity, knowing that these moments were crucial in sustaining their traditions and shaping their family’s identity. The process was somewhat time-consuming, with stages of fermenting and filtering requiring patience and precision, but this only encouraged further conversation and connection between the two. During these hours spent making tej, Derrick's appreciation for the family customs grew even deeper. He realized the significance of preserving these traditions, not just for himself, but for the generations that would come after him. Kevin too, gained a renewed sense of pride in their heritage and the importance of passing on the values embodied in their culture. As the days went by and the tej matured, Kevin and Derrick eagerly anticipated the moment when they could share it with the rest of the family. Finally, the day arrived, and their home was filled with laughter, stories, and a deep sense of belonging. As they toasted with glasses of their homemade tej, the room was filled with the spirit of their ancestors, beaming with pride at the connections being forged and the traditions being preserved. It was in that moment that Kevin knew teaching Derrick the art of making tej was more than just a fun way to spend time together – it was a means of strengthening their family’s roots and ensuring their customs would continue to thrive for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: New Hampshire Route 202A (abbreviated NH 202A) is a 14.639 mi east–west state highway in Strafford and Rockingham counties in southeastern New Hampshire. The western terminus is in Northwood at U.S. Route 202 and New Hampshire 9, near their intersection with U.S. Route 4. Its eastern terminus is in downtown Rochester at New Hampshire Route 108 and New Hampshire Route 125. Hypothesis: New Hampshire Route 202A is more than 14.638 miles in length.","completion":"Based on the context provided, the hypothesis that New Hampshire Route 202A is more than 14.638 miles in length can be supported. The context clearly states that New Hampshire Route 202A, an east-west state highway in Strafford and Rockingham counties, is 14.639 miles long. The given distance is precise and accurate, immediately providing evidence to support the hypothesis. Furthermore, the context also mentions that this state highway has two distinct termini: one in Northwood at the intersection of U.S. Route 202 and New Hampshire Route 9 (close to U.S. Route 4) and the other at the eastern end in downtown Rochester, where it connects with New Hampshire Route 108 and New Hampshire Route 125. The fact that the context specifically provides the endpoints of the route, also supports the validity of the hypothesis. With these two termini, one can easily determine the scale of the region covered by New Hampshire Route 202A, which is indeed more than 14.638 miles in length. In summary, the context provides a clear and precise measurement of New Hampshire Route 202A's length (14.639 miles) and its termini, on which we can confidently draw the hypothesis that New Hampshire Route 202A is more than 14.638 miles in length."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hoffman's modem peers are not so fortunate.The Mrs. Robinsons aren't sitting around at home any more.They are out in the workplace,doing the high-powered jobs the graduates want,but cannot get.For those fresh out of university,desperate for work but unable to get it,there is a big imbalance between supply and demand.And there is no narrowing of the gap in sight. Parents feel as badly let down as the young people themselves.Middle-class families see their graduate offspring on the dole queue and wonder why they bothered paying school fees.Working-class families feel an even keener sense of disappointment.For many such families,getting a child into university was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream.It was proof that they were living in a dynamic,economically successful country.That dream does not seem so rosy now.Graduate unemployment is not,ultimately,a political problem.Job-creation for graduates is very low down in the government's schedule.If David Cameron's Conservatives had a brilliant idea for guaranteeing every graduate a well-paid job,they would have presented it by now.It is a social problem,though a more deep-seated social problem than people perhaps realize.

The author acknowledges that graduate unemployment is ultimately not a political problem but a deeper and more complex social issue, which suggests that it may not have a quick or straightforward solution. This is further supported by the fact that job creation for graduates is ranked very low down in the government's schedule and, even if a political party like David Cameron's Conservatives were to have a brilliant idea, it would likely take time to implement and address the root causes of graduate unemployment.

Paragraph: Context: Coptidis rhizome (CR), also known as Huanglian in Chinese, is the rhizome of Coptis chinensis Franch., C. deltoidea C.Y. Cheng et Hsiao, or C. teeta Wall (Ranunculaceae). It has been widely used to treat bacillary dysentery, diabetes, pertussis, sore throat, aphtha, and eczema in China. Objectives: The present paper reviews the latest advances of CR, focusing on the botany, phytochemistry, traditional usages, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology and toxicology of CR and its future perspectives. Methods: Studies from 1985 to 2018 were reviewed from books; PhD. and MSc. dissertations; the state and local drug standards; PubMed; CNKI; Scopus; the Web of Science; and Google Scholar using the keywords Coptis, Coptidis Rhizoma, Huanglian, and goldthread. Results: Currently, 128 chemical constituents have been isolated and identified from CR. Alkaloids are the characteristic components, together with organic acids, coumarins, phenylpropanoids and quinones. The extracts/compounds isolated from CR cover a wide pharmacological spectrum, including antibacterial, antivirus, antifungal, antidiabetic, anticancer and cardioprotective effects. Berberine is the most important active constituent and the primary toxic component of CR. Conclusions: As an important herbal medicine in Chinese medicine, CR has the potential to treat various diseases. However, further research should be undertaken to investigate the clinical effects, toxic constituents, target organs and pharmacokinetics, and to establish criteria for quality control, for CR and its related medications. In addition, the active constituents, other than alkaloids, in both raw and processed products of CR should be investigated.

Freshwater pearl mussel Although the name \`\`freshwater pearl mussel'' is often used for this species, other freshwater mussel species can also create pearls and some can also be used as a source of mother of pearl. In fact, most cultured pearls today come from Hyriopsis species in Asia, or Amblema species in North America, both members of the related family Unionidae; pearls are also found within species in the genus Unio. Available choices: 1. no. 2. yes. Is this statement correct \\"can you find a pearl in a mussel\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"can you find a pearl in a mussel\\" is correct. Pearls can be found within various mussel species. Freshwater pearl mussels, belonging to the family Margaritiferidae, are known for their potential to produce pearls. However, other freshwater mussel species also create pearls, and some can be used as a source of mother of pearl. Most cultured pearls today come from Asia and North America, primarily involving mussel species from the family Unionidae. In Asia, one dominant genus in pearl production is Hyriopsis, while in North America, Amblema is a significant genus for the same. Additionally, pearls can also be found within species in the genus Unio, which to is a part of the Unionidae family. Pearl formation within a mussel occurs when an irritant, such as a parasite, a piece of food, or even a microscopic organism, becomes trapped within the mussel's soft tissue. To protect itself, the mussel starts coating the irritant with nacre, a substance secreted by the mollusk that forms the inner lining of its shell. The layers of nacre build up over time, gradually forming a pearl. Note that not all mussel species produce pearls, and even among the pearl-producing species, the process of natural pearl formation is relatively rare. The freshwater pearl mussels and the genera mentioned earlier are good sources for pearls due to their propensity to form pearls and the good quality of the pearls they produce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The modern era of comics in Japan began after World War II, propelled by the success of the serialized comics of the prolific Osamu Tezuka and the comic strip Sazae-san. Genres and audiences diversified over the following decades. Stories are usually first serialized in magazines which are often hundreds of pages thick and may over a dozen stories; they are later compiled in tankōbon-format books.

There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations.

Summarize: Map: Who's making the most out of parking? Are these councils being more sympathetic to motorists, or missing the opportunity to offer improved services to businesses and residents? According to the RAC Foundation report, English councils had a total surplus of £565m from parking operations in 2011-12, up £54m on the previous year. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, describes the revenue from parking charges as \\"a nice little earner\\" for councils. Topping the list of authorities is Westminster, where officials, as well as disputing some of the figures behind its reported £41.6m surplus, say the revenue helps pay for a range of vital transport and highways services that help the High Street prosper. Bottom of the table are Essex County Council, which lost £1.8m, and Surrey County Council which lost £1.3m. Councillor Rodney Bass, Essex cabinet member for highways and transportation, said: \\"The boroughs and districts have their own off-street car parking, but we don't have a tradition of on-street parking charges and it works very well. \\"It is called 'localism'. We decide what happens here and [Westminster] decides there. \\"We run a park-and-ride system, Essex has one of the best here in Chelmsford. \\"Our car parks are still off-street. I don't think there is a single parking meter in Essex - we are a parking meter-free county and we are proud of it.\\" Similar park-and-ride schemes run by other authorities are often paid for by money brought in through parking charges. Guildford Borough Council, which generates more money from its parking than all the other Surrey boroughs and districts combined, is set to launch its fourth park-and-ride service in the town. \\"In Guildford we make around a million a year in surplus and use that to subsidise the park-and-ride scheme into town, a scheme that has proven popular with traders and residents alike,\\" says Councillor David Goodwin, who sits as an opposition member on both Surrey County and Guildford Borough Councils. He was also a member of Surrey's parking task group. \\"The park-and-ride is there to alleviate parking and traffic problems in the town. If you just look at the park-and-ride they wouldn't be able to operate at the level they do without the parking income,\\" he says. \\"For the traders in town and the workers in town, park-and-ride helps them. It keeps traffic out of the town centre which is a massive benefit to the residents who live there. \\"As an opposition member I would love to say it's 'money-grabbing' but I just can't, and I don't get that at all from residents.\\" As well as accusations of \\"money-grabbing', authorities are accused of using parking charges and fines as \\"stealth taxes\\", but officials at the biggest earner highlight the use of funds for area improvements. Westminster service development manager Kieran Fitsall says: \\"The actual surplus was £36.3m last year and the money generated goes on transport and infrastructure, this includes bridge repairs and all sorts of schemes from the Freedom Pass and concessionary fares for the elderly and disabled. \\"It all goes back into transport.\\" He adds: \\"One misconception is that Westminster generates money from issuing parking tickets. We don't actually generate money from issuing parking tickets, it practically costs us the same to operate that as we take in.\\" A Controlled Parking Zone permit in Westminster costs £130, while daily and hourly charges vary depending on where you park from £1.20 per hour to £4.40. \\"Charges for the permits were set some years back and are reviewed every two years, normally it is just an inflationary increase,\\" says Mr Fitsall. \\"Money that is generated is from people paying to park legally. Last year we took in £38.3m from people paying legally to park. \\"That has been increasing as more people have been parking legally. The number of tickets being given out has gone down and there have been no cutbacks of enforcement officers. \\"These charges are important as it benefits everyone in terms of those who live and work in Westminster.\\" The growth in pay-by-phone parking has seen revenues rise and tickets issued fall, while the council also has a smartphone app in the works that will let people know the location of available spaces. The app, called \\"park right\\", tells users in real time which parking spots are free and which are taken. The council is currently at the procurement stage so will not confirm the cost of the project, which will involve installing small sensors in the road to relay information to the app displaying free spaces as green dots and occupied ones in red. \\"We are looking at anything we can do to cut down on congestion and make it easier to get around,\\" says Mr Mr Fitsall. \\"It is better for the High Street as people spend less time looking for parking and more time in the shops.\\" The full list of councils operating parking services at a loss are: Ashfield, Babergh, Barnet, Basildon, Blaby, Breckland, Brentwood, Broadland, Broxtowe, Corby, Crawley, Cumbria, Daventry, East Cambridgeshire ,East Northamptonshire, Essex, Fenland, Forest of Dean, Gedling, Halton UA, Hertsmere, Hyndburn, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Norfolk, North East Derbyshire, North Warwickshire, Northamptonshire, Norwich, Oadby & Wigston, Pendle, Redditch, Rossendale, Sandwell, South Cambridgeshire, South Derbyshire, South Gloucestershire UA, South Norfolk, South Northamptonshire, South Ribble, South Staffordshire, Sunderland, Surrey, Surrey Heath, Tandridge, Telford and the Wrekin UA, Three Rivers, Walsall, Warrington UA, Wealden, Wellingborough, West Lindsey, West Oxfordshire.","completion":"A report by the RAC Foundation states that English councils had a surplus of £565 million from parking operations in 2011-12, an increase of £54 million compared to the previous year.

Answer the following question: Information: - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions. - A metropolitan borough is a type of local government district in England, and is a subdivision of a metropolitan county. Created in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, metropolitan boroughs are defined in English law as metropolitan districts. However, all of them have been granted or regranted royal charters to give them borough status (as well as, in some cases, city status). Metropolitan boroughs have been effectively unitary authority areas since the abolition of the metropolitan county councils by the Local Government Act 1985. However, metropolitan boroughs pool much of their authority in joint boards and other arrangements that cover whole metropolitan counties, such as combined authorities. - New Guinea (or, historically, \\"\\") is a large Island in the South West Pacific region. - In computing, WinG (pronounced \\"Win Gee\\") is an application programming interface that is a port of Windows 95's Device Independent Bitmaps to provide faster graphics performance on Windows 3.x operating environments, and was initially positioned as a way to help game developers more easily port their DOS games to Microsoft Windows, although it was quickly discontinued in favor of DirectX. - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. - Sir George Hamilton Kenrick FRES ( 1850 -- 28 May 1939 ) was an English entomologist who specialised in Lepidoptera especially those of New Guinea and he was a councillor in Birmingham . - Birmingham is a major city and metropolitan borough of West Midlands, England.

Most lepidopterans are moths; and there are thought to be approximately 160,000 species of moth, many of which are yet to be described. Most species of moth are nocturnal, but there are also crepuscular and diurnal species. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera. - Insects (from Latin ', a calque of Greek ['], \\"cut into sections\\") are a class of invertebrates within the arthropod phylum that have a chitinous exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. They are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, including more than a million described species and representing more than half of all known living organisms. The number of extant species is estimated at between six and ten million, and potentially represent over 90% of the differing animal life forms on Earth. Insects may be found in nearly all environments, although only a small number of species reside in the oceans, a habitat dominated by another arthropod group, crustaceans. - A Councillor is a member of a local government council. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

Mitt Romney garnered the same percentage of the popular vote he remarked represented the woebegone portion of the American electorate who will never 'take personal responsibility and care for their (own) lives.' In a bit of electoral irony, the Associated Press calculated the Republican presidential nominee amassed 47.2 per cent of the full presidential vote, or 48 per cent when considering only him and Obama. Oops: Romney said during the campaign 47 per cent of America people would never vote for him because they were entitlement-obsessed people who didn't care about lower taxes. He said what? Romney remarked of the 47 per cent who would never vote for him, 'My job is not to worry about those people' Oveheard: Romney's remark, which many think torpedoed his changes on Election Day, was caught by a hidden camera. Romney had presaged that the Democratic incumbent would - in fact- be the candidate to cull that particular percentage, when he told a cabal of fat cat donors that nearly half of America would never vote for him - or his policies. 'And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax' That 47 per cent of the American electorate, he said, represent those, 'who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. 'That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.' 'My job is not to worry about those people,” Romney said in the vexing video. “I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.' Some believe Romney's biting rejoinder, captured on a hidden camera and later posted to the Internet, torpedoed his bid for the presidency. Romney's remark regarding 47 per cent of Americans was captured during a closed-door Florida fundraiser for fat cat donors. Romney later reportedly said he was speaking 'off the cuff' and replying to a question when he issued the acerbic address. He apparently made the unfortunate remarks at a closed-door Florida fundraiser while on the campaign trail during the summer, or well before November's Election Day. Romney later reportedly said he was speaking 'off the cuff' and replying to a question when he issued the acerbic address. 'It’s a question and answer, as I recall, about the process of the campaign and how I’m going to get the 51 or 52 per cent I need, and I point out it’s by focusing on those folks that are neither in [Obama's] camp nor in my camp,' Romney said. Close shave: Obama, for his part, notched 51.03 per cent of the popular vote in the 2012 U.S. presidential election. 'I recognize that among those that pay. no tax, approximately 47 percent of Americans, I’m not likely to be. highly successful with the message of lowering taxes. 'That’s not as attractive to those who don’t pay income taxes as it is to those who do,' Romney reportedly said in explanation. 'And likewise those who are reliant on government are not as attracted to my message of slimming down the size of government. And so I then focus on those individuals who I believe are most likely to be able to be pulled into my camp and help me win the 51 or 50.1 percent that I need to become the next President.'

Therefore, very few people were able to enjoy some of history's most important and interesting artifacts . This has changed with an increase in the number of traveling museum exhibitions. King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more.

I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge. Neuronal Charged Membranes The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 35.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential. Q: For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive what? Choices: - pulses - proteins - information - signals A: Answer:","completion":"For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. The nervous system, which is comprised of complex networks of neurons, depends on the transmission of signals for communication between different parts of the body. Neurons are specialized cells designed to transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells. They are capable of sending fast, electrochemical signals called action potentials to other cells, thanks to their distinctive properties such as the resting membrane potential and the capacity to generate and propagate an electrical signal. The neuron's membrane maintains a negative baseline or resting charge, which can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. This membrane charge is central in initiating and conducting the electrical signals neurons send and receive. Neurons possess a lipid bilayer membrane which is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. For charged ions to enter or exit the neuron, they must do so through specialized proteins - ion channels - that traverse the membrane. These ion channels can exist in various states: open, closed, or inactive. Some channels need to be triggered to open and let ions pass into or out of the cell. Specifically, there are ion channels called voltage-gated ion channels, which transform their structure in response to variations in voltage. These types of ion channels play a critical role in regulating the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. This difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell constitutes the membrane potential, which is fundamental for the transmission of signals. Therefore, for the nervous system to function effectively, it is essential that neurons are capable of sending and receiving signals. This capacity for signal transmission allows the organism to interact with and respond to its environment, and enables various bodily functions and processes."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given an input stream, and your task is to produce a grammatically correct version of the input sentence.

The connectivity panel didn't work and calling the desk didn't provide a solution. We came back to our room about 1:00 AM to find the curtains stuck open and with all the light from the surrounding buildings and the sunlight in the morning, this was going to be a problem. I called the front desk and they said it would looked after promptly. After an hour wait I called again and was connected to the maintenance people who told me they were never told of our problem by the front desk. Half an our later our curtains were fixed. For us it was all in all a poor experience for 5 days. there are better places to stay in Vegas.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... After this semester, what class will David Meyer teach?

Write some highlights for the following article: The rift between teachers and Michael Gove widened yesterday when a moderate teachers’ union passed a motion of no confidence in the Education Secretary for the first time in its history. The Association of Teachers and Lecturers voted overwhelmingly that Mr Gove and Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw showed an ‘abject failure to improve education or treat teachers, parents and pupils with respect’. More militant unions regularly show dissatisfaction with Government policies in similar debates. But the ATL’s support for the first such motion in its 129 years indicates a hardening of opinion among teachers and other school staff. Teachers from the ATL union passed a vote of no confidence in Education Secretary Michael Gove (left) and Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw. The two biggest unions – the National. Union of Teachers and the NASUWT – have already announced strike action. over pay, conditions and pensions. There is also anger at Mr Gove’s attempts to toughen exams and get rid of ‘trendy’ methods he believes have lowered standards. ATL member Jean Roberts said teachers. were overstretched and ‘bullying by the two Michaels’ was affecting head. teachers, ‘who seem to feel they have to hand that down to staff’. She. added: ‘We are saying enough is enough.’ Teacher Chrissie Jolinon, from Brent,. north-west London, said teachers were not consulted about changes. She. accused Sir Michael of ‘tinkering’ to ‘drive forward Government policy. for academies’. Earlier, general secretary Dr Mary. Bousted told the conference in Liverpool that Mr Gove was ‘shamefully. neglecting’ children, and his reforms would damage education, leaving. morale at ‘rock bottom’. She added: ‘In 2013, every aspect of the. curriculum you teach, the qualifications you prepare children to take,. is under attack and review.’ ‘Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw are like Blood Brothers, with a. pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system and the. teachers who work within it.’ The union’s survey of 996 members on Mr Gove’s performance found 91 per cent rated him a ‘fail’. Three-quarters criticised his. curriculum revisions, which focus on basic maths and English and a. chronological approach to history. ATL general secretary Mary Bousted said Michael Gove and Sir Michael Wilshaw pact to suck the life and hope out of our education system. Changes to GCSEs and A-levels, such as. ditching modules in favour of final exams, are also unpopular. Meanwhile, 60 per cent thought chief schools inspector Sir Michael. should be on ‘special measures’. The NUT and NASUWT last week announced strikes beginning on June 27 and culminating in a national strike before Christmas. They have said they will postpone them if Mr Gove attends constructive talks and delays introducing performance-related pay. Days later, 100 Left-wing academics. wrote to two national papers claiming pupils were doomed to ‘failure and. demoralisation’ under the proposed curriculum, which is out for. consultation until next month. An Ofsted spokesman said: ‘Sir Michael. has said from the outset any provision that is less than good is not. acceptable. That’s a tough message, especially for those schools and. colleges that have been coasting.’ A Department for Education spokesman. said: ‘We need to make sure we have an education system that is robust. and rigorous . This ambition is surely something the ATL should be. supporting.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

Can I get my virgins in paradise if I become a Muslim now? Well, buddy, let me explain it to you. Some people believe that if you do good things, you'll be rewarded in a place called paradise.

A long, long time ago, in a faraway land, there were people called Turks. They met some traveling people who believed in Islam. These travelers taught the Turks about Islam. The Turks liked what they heard, and eventually, many Turks started believing in Islam too. This happened over hundreds of years and through contact, friendships and learning from each other. 3.

Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. and a hint : Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination...

Write an article based on this summary: Sixteen Turkish construction workers have been freed a month after they were kidnapped in the Iraqi capital Baghdad, Turkish PM Ahmet Davutoglu has said. Article:","completion":"Title: Sixteen Turkish Construction Workers Freed After Abduction in Baghdad Introduction: In a series of events that brought relief to Turkey and the families of the victims, sixteen Turkish construction workers, who had been abducted a month ago in the Iraqi capital city of Baghdad, were recently released. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu confirmed the news, stating that the previously kidnapped workers were finally freed and are in good health. Background of the kidnapping: The abduction took place on September 2, 2015, when a group of unknown armed militants stormed the construction site where the workers were stationed. The workers were employed by Nurol Insaat, a Turkish construction firm contracted to build a sports stadium in the city and were being held hostage at an unknown location in Iraq. The militants initially demanded the release of their associates held in Turkish jails as well as stopping the flow of Turkish shipments of arms and supplies to factions in Iraq that confronted the extremist groups. However, the specific identity of the extremist group responsible for the kidnapping remained unknown throughout the ordeal. Turkish Government's efforts: After the abduction came to light, the Turkish government initiated efforts to secure the release of its citizens. The government authorities at both Turkey and Iraq's diplomatic missions maintained contact throughout the hostage situation. The two countries cooperated by closely monitoring the situation and sharing intelligence data to ensure that the hostages were safely located and released. Turkish intelligence organization MIT (Milli Istihbarat Teskilati) played a crucial role in the release of the workers. The Release: The workers were released at an unknown location in Iraq after the Turkish authorities successfully fulfilled the abductors' demands. Although the specifics of the release deal have not been disclosed, it is believed that negotiations between the Turkish government and the kidnappers positively impacted the outcome. The construction workers were found in good health and are now being transported to Turkey. Impact on Turkish-Iraqi relations: The successful release of the kidnapped workers signifies a milestone in Turkish-Iraqi relations, indicating a strengthening of diplomatic and intelligence cooperation between the two countries. The incident further highlights the need for these nations to collaborate in the ongoing battle against extremist groups in the region. The release of the workers has also boosted Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu's reputation amongst the Turkish people, demonstrating his government's ability to secure the safety of its citizens abroad. In conclusion, the release of the sixteen Turkish construction workers abducted in Baghdad marks a positive development in the ongoing fight against extremist groups in the Middle East. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of collaboration between nations and enhances regional cooperation between Turkey and Iraq in ensuring the safety and security of their citizens. As the issue of kidnappings conducted by militant organizations remains a genuine concern globally, the successful outcome of this situation provides hope for a proactive, cooperative approach in tackling these issues in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From the moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the warm and inviting ambiance. The tasteful decor, soft lighting, and comfortable seating arrangement made for a delightful atmosphere where one could truly relax and savor the exquisite dishes the restaurant had to offer. Upon being seated, we were promptly greeted by our friendly and knowledgeable server, Amanda. She took the time to walk us through the menu, pointing out signature dishes and offering her recommendations based on our preferences. I appreciated her engaging and attentive approach, which truly made the dining experience special. As for the food, The Gourmet Bistro blew me away with their array of mouthwatering options. I started with the truffle-infused mushroom soup, which was rich, velvety, and bursting with flavor. The soup was served with freshly baked artisanal bread, which I couldn't help but devour. For my main course, I opted for the pan-seared sea bass with saffron risotto, asparagus, and a lemon butter sauce. The fish was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin, flaky texture, and delicate flavor that married perfectly with the delectable risotto. The portion size was generous, yet the dish was incredibly well-balanced. The asparagus was a delightful addition, cooked al dente and adding just the right amount of crunch to offset the creaminess of the risotto. The lemon butter sauce was a sublime addition, providing just the right level of brightness and acidity to round out the dish. My dining partner chose the restaurant's signature dish, the slow-braised beef short rib with garlic mashed potatoes and roasted root vegetables. The short rib was tender, succulent, and melting in the mouth, generously coated with a rich, savory sauce that accentuated the depth of flavor present in the meat. Both the garlic mashed potatoes and the roasted root vegetables were delicious accompaniments, making the dish hearty and satisfying. Despite being absolutely satiated, we couldn't resist indulging in dessert. We shared the decadent chocolate lava cake with raspberry coulis and vanilla bean ice cream. The cake was warm and gooey with a rich, molten chocolate center that tantalized the taste buds. The combination of the tangy raspberry coulis and the smooth, cool vanilla bean ice cream complemented the cake beautifully and brought the dessert experience to an exquisite conclusion. Throughout the evening, the service at The Gourmet Bistro remained attentive, professional, and genuinely friendly. Our water glasses were never left empty, and our server frequently checked in to ensure we were enjoying our experience and had everything we needed. In summary, The Gourmet Bistro exceeded my expectations in every aspect – food quality, presentation, service, and ambiance. If you're looking for a dining experience that surpasses the ordinary, I highly recommend giving this exceptional establishment a visit. I'm already looking forward to my next meal at The Gourmet Bistro and sampling more of their delectable creations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert Walls (born 21 July 1950) is a former Australian rules footballer who represented Carlton and Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1960s and 1970s. In a playing career that spanned three decades Robert played a combined 259 games and kicked a total of 444 goals. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s he continued to coach in the VFL/AFL for a total of 347 games across four different clubs. As a coach, his greatest achievement came in 1987 when he coached Carlton to the 1987 VFL premiership, the same club he won premierships with as player in 1968, 1970 and 1972. Walls coached the Brisbane Bears from 1991-1995. It took until the early 2000s for Robert's style of coaching to surface as a method that had become outdated, and criticised in the football and wider community. Robert would coach Brisbane Bears for 109 games (30 wins - 78 losses - 1 draw). It was revealed in the video \\"Passion To Play\\" that in Walls first year as Bears coach in 1991, as disciplinary action Walls authorised his players to don boxing gloves and beat 21-year-old teammate Shane Strempel repetitively in the head until he was severely bashed and bloodied after which Strempel quit playing football. Walls' coaching style was criticised about the incident by Kevin Sheedy who has several times questioned his credibility as a football coach. In his last season, 1995, he had been told after Round 15 that with 4 wins and 11 losses for the season, he would not be re-appointed for 1996. But a major turning point in the season for the Bears soon came. In Round 16, against Hawthorn, Brisbane trailed by 45 points at 3-quarter time and ended up winning by 7, which remains a VFL/AFL record for the biggest 3-quarter time deficit turned into a win. From there, the Bears continued their run and won 6 of their next 7 games. They found themselves in eighth position, and qualifying for the finals, after being second-last just 7 weeks earlier. They faced Carlton, the top ranked side in week one of the finals, and went down by just 13 points, a monumental achievement considering Carlton won the next two weeks by more than 10 goals to claim the premiership. Despite this turnaround, a change of heart was not considered, and Walls moved to Richmond the following year to coach. What was the cause of that?","completion":"The cause of Robert Walls' coaching style being criticized and ultimately becoming outdated can be traced back to a specific incident in 1991, when he authorized his players to use boxing gloves to beat 21-year-old teammate Shane Strempel as a form of disciplinary action. As mentioned in the article, \\"in Walls first year as Bears coach in 1991, as disciplinary action Walls authorised his players to don boxing gloves and beat 21-year-old teammate Shane Strempel repetitively in the head until he was severely bashed and bloodied after which Strempel quit playing football.\\" This harsh approach to discipline was heavily criticized by Kevin Sheedy, who questioned Walls' credibility as a football coach. As time passed and the game evolved, coaching methods and player management also progressed, resulting in Walls' style coming under scrutiny as being outdated. Despite experiencing a significant turnaround in his last season with the Brisbane Bears in 1995, where they won 6 of their last 7 games and qualified for the finals, Walls' contract was not renewed for the following year. This was mainly due to the club's decision to move in a different direction and adopt more modern coaching methods, as Walls' controversial approach had already generated criticism within the football and wider community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It states that nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. This principle can be traced to the Atlantic Charter, signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. It also is derived from principles espoused by United States President Woodrow Wilson following World War I, after which some new nation states were formed, or previous states were revived after the dissolution of empires. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should benor what constitutes a nation. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination. - The Bangladesh Awami League (Bengali transliteration: ; translated from Urdu: Bangladesh People's League); AL is one of the two major political parties of Bangladesh.

The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals. - Bhutan ('), officially the Kingdom of Bhutan ('), is a landlocked country and the smallest state in Asia to be located entirely within the Himalaya mountain range.

Does the sentence \\"If a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty.\\" answer the question \\"What may be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating a treaty?\\" Choices: [+] yes; [+] no;","completion":"No, the sentence \\"If a party has materially violated or breached its treaty obligations, the other parties may invoke this breach as grounds for temporarily suspending their obligations to that party under the treaty.\\" does not directly answer the question \\"What may be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating a treaty?\\" However, it provides information on the temporary suspension of obligations due to a material breach or violation of the treaty. To answer the question about permanently terminating a treaty, it is important to understand that international law provides certain grounds under which a treaty can be terminated. These grounds are primarily outlined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), which serves as a guide for international treaty practice. According to the VCLT, parties to a treaty can invoke the following grounds for permanently terminating a treaty: 1. Consent of all parties: If all the parties involved in the treaty agree to its termination, the treaty can be terminated. 2. Termination clause: If the treaty contains a provision specifying the conditions or dates for its termination, the parties can use this clause as a basis for ending the treaty. 3. Material breach: A material breach is a significant violation of a treaty by one party, which entitles the other parties to consider the treaty terminated. This refers to cases where a party has either (a) repudiated the treaty or (b) violated a provision essential to the fulfillment of the treaty's object and purpose. The sentence you provided suggested invoking the breach as grounds for temporarily suspending obligations under the treaty. However, in certain instances, a material breach can be invoked as grounds for permanently terminating the treaty as well. 4. Fundamental change of circumstances: Known as the \\"Rebus Sic Stantibus\\" doctrine, a fundamental change in circumstances may allow a party to terminate a treaty if the change is unforeseen and has a drastic impact on the obligations initially undertaken by the parties involved. 5. Impossibility of performance: If it becomes impossible for a party to fulfill its obligations under a treaty, termination can be invoked based on this ground. 6. Emergence of a new peremptory norm: When a new peremptory norm (jus cogens) of international law emerges, any existing treaty that is in conflict with this new norm becomes void and can be terminated. 7. Desuetude: If a treaty falls into a state of disuse and is no longer considered relevant by the parties involved, it may be terminated due to desuetude. In conclusion, while the sentence provided does not directly answer the question about permanently terminating a treaty, there are various grounds provided by international law that allow for the termination of a treaty. Material breach, as mentioned in the sentence, is one such ground for termination, although the sentence specifically refers to temporary suspension."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Abul Taher. PUBLISHED:. 17:05 EST, 4 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 17:05 EST, 4 January 2014. A former Tory Minister who is now a key adviser to Boris Johnson has branded the Government sexist after it said adverts for top public sector jobs should be dumbed down to encourage women applicants. Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the ‘action plan’ issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be ‘simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates’. The document adds: ‘Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants.’ Ex-Treasury Minister Angela Knight attacked the 'action plan' issued by the Cabinet Office which says public sector bodies should be 'simplifying adverts and using language which will encourage candidates' Mrs Knight, who has positions in both public and private sector boardrooms, said: ‘I am all in favour of equal opportunities and there is certainly some evidence from the City that women on boards improve company performance. ‘But I don’t think things need to be made simple just so women can get their heads around things. I think organisations should use plain English to attract the right candidates regardless of gender.’ Mrs Knight, 63, sits on the board of Transport for London, a public body which Mr Johnson chairs. She is also chief executive of Energy UK, the industry body for Britain’s biggest power firms. Mrs Knight added: ‘None of my jobs have been traditionally “female”, so I can honestly say it makes no difference to me if my colleagues are male or female. In the end, it’s ability that counts.’ Sarah Wollaston, Tory MP for Totnes, also criticised the plan and asked for the document to be reworded. The guidelines have been published by the Centre for Public Appointments (CPA). Its job is to meet the Government’s target of ensuring that half of all senior posts within Government and public sector organisations are filled by women by 2015. But despite the criticism from Mrs Knight and Ms Wollaston, some female business leaders support the action plan. The document adds: 'Job adverts and specifications [should] use plain English and avoid jargon to appeal to the widest field of applicants' Fiona Hathorn, of independent pressure group Women On Board, said: ‘Top women are being put off when it comes to applying for roles by job advertisements laden with historic public sector jargon.’ The CPA works with the Commissioner for Public Appointments to encourage more women in boardrooms. Commissioner Sir David Normington’s report for 2012-13 paints a rather bleak picture of public sector appointments for women. In 2001, 39 per cent of appointments were made to women. But in 2012-13, that figure had dropped to 35.6 per cent. The Cabinet Office’s own figures for 2012-13, show that most Government departments have failed to reach the equality target. Departments such as the Ministry of Defence had women filling only 17 per cent of vacancies, while the Department for Transport fared even worse at 16 per cent. The Cabinet Office last night denied its action plan was patronising towards women. It said: ‘As part of our wider work to reform Whitehall, we want job advertisements to be clear and free of jargon. 'This is good practice in business. It is simply not true to suggest we are dumbing down for women.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"In this article, a former Tory Minister named Angela Knight, who is now an adviser to Boris Johnson, has said that the government is being sexist. The government suggested that job advertisements for important public sector jobs should be made more simple to encourage women to apply. Angela Knight doesn't agree with making things simple just for women. She thinks that using plain English in job advertisements is good for everyone, not just for women. Some female business leaders agree with what Angela said, while others think that using plain language will help get more women into these important jobs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In New Hollywood films, the film director, rather than the studio, took on a key authorial role. \\"New Hollywood\\" usually refers to a period of film-making rather than a style of film-making, though it can be referred to as a movement. The films made in this era are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often strongly deviated from classical norms. - Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.

The soothing aroma of lavender incense filled the air and his breaths synchronized with the serene melodies playing softly in the background. Adam usually started his sessions with a few deep breaths in the seated position, allowing his body to awaken and his mind to clear itself of any lingering thoughts or distractions. As he inhaled deeply, he felt the cool air rushing into his lungs and his chest expanding outward, and upon exhaling, he allowed the tensions and stress to flow out of his body, setting the stage for the practice ahead. Transitioning smoothly from one pose to the next, Adam's focus centered on maintaining steady, even breaths and cultivating a sense of presence and mindfulness. He expertly maneuvered through the various asanas, engaging his core and lengthening his spine in poses like Downward-Facing Dog and Warrior II. He felt his muscles stretching and opening up, releasing any stiffness or discomfort he had experienced earlier that morning. His yoga practice had become a vital part of his daily routine, and it had made a significant impact on his mental and physical well-being. Adam had first turned to yoga several years ago, during a particularly tumultuous period in his life. At the time, he had been struggling with anxiety and stress, experiencing sleepless nights and a constant sense of unease. Gradually, as Adam began integrating yoga into his life, he noticed a vast improvement in his overall mood and outlook. The ancient practice had taught him how to calm his mind, regulate his breathing, and approach life's challenges with a renewed sense of resilience and adaptability. Moreover, the physical benefits became increasingly apparent as his strength, flexibility, and balance improved. As his practice progressed, so did his connection to the present moment. Adam began to develop a greater appreciation for the little things in life, from the rustling leaves outside his window to the embrace of a loved one. He noticed that the more he nurtured his yoga practice, the deeper his roots within his own personal growth became. After all, at its core, yoga had always been about embracing the present and finding harmony within oneself and the world. Now, as Adam neared the end of his practice, he eased into his favorite pose, Savasana, or Corpse Pose. He lay flat on his back, arms at his sides, palms facing upward, and his legs slightly apart. His eyes gently closed as he allowed his breath to return to its natural rhythm. In this moment of stillness, his body absorbed the benefits of his practice, as he felt the soothing energy wash over him like a gentle embrace. With a final deep breath, Adam signaled the end of his practice, slowly rising to sit on his folded legs. Bringing his hands together at his heart center, he took a moment to express gratitude for the gift of yoga and sent out a silent wish for the well-being of all living beings. As he opened his eyes and unrolled the mat, he embraced the day with renewed energy, calmness, and a sense of inner peace, ready to face the world with balance and grace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The ukiyo-e artist Hokusai popularized the Japanese term for comics and cartooning, manga, in the early 19th century. In the post-war era modern Japanese comics began to flourish when Osamu Tezuka produced a prolific body of work. Towards the close of the 20th century, these three traditions converged in a trend towards book-length comics: the comics album in Europe, the tankōbon[a] in Japan, and the graphic novel in the English-speaking countries.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Q: What is a substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution? A: The answer is:","completion":"A substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration of a solution is an acid. Acids are compounds that donate hydrogen ions (H+) or protons to a solution, leading to an increased concentration of hydrogen ions. This results in a lower pH value, reflecting higher acidity. Common examples of acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and acetic acid (CH3COOH). These substances can dissociate in water, releasing hydrogen ions and increasing the solution's acidity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: a plane flying around a blue globe .","completion":"In the given sentence - \\"a plane flying around a blue globe\\" - the most important words are \\"plane,\\" \\"flying,\\" \\"around,\\" \\"blue,\\" and \\"globe.\\" Each of these words carries significant weight and helps convey the overall meaning of the sentence. Here's an explanation of why these words are important: 1. \\"Plane\\": This noun is crucial in the sentence because it defines the main subject of the sentence. The entire sentence revolves around the plane, which is the focal point. Without this word, it's impossible to know what is flying around the globe. 2. \\"Flying\\": This verb is essential in understanding the action being taken by the plane. It provides information about the motion and status of the plane. Without \\"flying,\\" we wouldn't be able to tell if the plane is stationary or in movement. 3. \\"Around\\": This preposition is important because it gives a sense of direction and provides spatial context to the plane's movement. It tells us that the plane is not merely flying in the vicinity of the blue globe but is moving in a circular or encompassing manner around it. Removing \\"around\\" from the sentence would change the meaning and lose the sense of the plane's flight path. 4. \\"Blue\\": This adjective serves to describe the appearance of the globe, giving the reader a more vivid mental picture. It may also carry some contextual significance - for instance, a blue globe might be referring to Earth, which is often called the \\"Blue Planet\\" due to its dominant color when viewed from space. Although \\"blue\\" is not as crucial as the other words, it does add value to the description and helps the reader visualize the scene. 5. \\"Globe\\": Finally, this noun is a vital part of the sentence because it identifies the object the plane is flying around. The presence of the globe gives context to the plane's movement and suggests a broader environment. Without \\"globe,\\" the sentence would be lacking an essential element that helps the reader understand the relationship between the plane and its surroundings. In summary, the words \\"plane,\\" \\"flying,\\" \\"around,\\" \\"blue,\\" and \\"globe\\" are all integral to the overall meaning and purpose of the sentence, as they each contribute to forming a visual and descriptive portrayal of the scene."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Michael has become bored with his passive life style, and has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby. He begins to exercise with weights several times a week. Michael's brother, Robert, isn't as motivated as Michael though. Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. But I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. What is an answer for this question: Who will increase the size of their muscles more? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Michael will increase the size of his muscles more than Robert. This is because Michael has decided to take up weight lifting as a hobby and exercises with weights several times a week, while Robert remains mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. Weight lifting involves the contraction of skeletal muscles against a resisting force, which in turn leads to an increase in muscle size and strength when done consistently. Since Michael is exercising more frequently with weights, his muscles will experience consistent stress and stimulation, allowing them to become bigger and stronger over time. In contrast, Robert's infrequent exercise routine will not provide his muscles with the same level of stress and stimulation, preventing them from achieving significant growth and strength improvements. As mentioned in the background information, continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles, and inactivity can lead to muscle atrophy (reduction in muscle size and strength). Therefore, Michael, with his regular weight lifting routine, will experience a greater increase in muscle size and strength compared to his brother Robert, who remains mostly inactive and only exercises occasionally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Ocean waves hit land - Ocean water pulls sand off of beaches - Ocean water breaks rocks off of cliffs - Ocean water carries sand and rocks into the ocean - Sand and rocks go to other land or the bottom of the ocean. Question: suppose You have less strong genetic makeup happens, how will it affect Cliffs and beaches are more exposed to water. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"When considering the effects of a less strong genetic makeup on cliffs and beaches, it is important to understand the factors that contribute to the stability and erosion of these natural features. Genetic makeup, in this context, can affect the biological and ecological aspects of the landscape, which in turn could influence the rate at which cliffs and beaches erode when exposed to ocean waves. A) More – Cliffs and beaches could theoretically be more exposed to water if less strong genetic makeup results in weaknesses among the species that form part of the ecosystem. For example, certain plants and animals play crucial roles in maintaining the stability of cliffs and beaches by contributing to soil stabilization through their roots and nutrient cycles. If these species are less resilient due to their genetic makeup, they may not be able to perform their roles effectively, leading to weaker soils and increased exposure of cliffs and beaches to water. One possible example could be the decline in the health of dune grass species, whose roots help bind the sand and stabilize beach dunes. A less robust genetic makeup could make these grasses more vulnerable to diseases, pests, or other environmental stressors, ultimately affecting the integrity of the entire beach ecosystem. As a result, the susceptibility of the sand and dunes to erosion could increase, and beaches may be more exposed to the erosive forces of ocean waves. B) Less – It is also possible that less strong genetic makeup could have an opposite effect on the exposure of cliffs and beaches to water. For instance, certain species, such as invasive plants, could disrupt the balance of an ecosystem and lead to increased erosion when they outcompete native species. If these invasive plants have less strong genetic makeup and are less fit than their native counterparts, the invasive species might not thrive in these environments, allowing native species to continue stabilizing cliffs and beaches. C) No effect – This option cannot be entirely ruled out, as it may be that less strong genetic makeup does not have a significant impact on the ecological functioning of the cliffs and beach ecosystems. In this case, any potential changes to the genetic makeup of species would not lead to clinical alterations in the ecosystem dynamics, and thus would not have a noticeable impact on the exposure of cliffs and beaches to water. In conclusion, the exact outcome resulting from the presence of less strong genetic makeup among species in cliff and beach ecosystems remains uncertain. Further studies would need to be carried out and include the specific genetic factors to experimentally determine the effect of species genetic makeup on the susceptibility of cliffs and beaches to water exposure. However, based on the discussion above, it appears that the relationship may not be straightforward, and the actual impact might be a combination of the factors outlined in options A, B, and C."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The perfect crop field could be inside a windowless building with controlled light, temperature,humidity,air quality and nutrition. It could be in a New York high- rise or a complex in the Saudi desert. It may be an answer to the world's food problems. The world already is having trouble feeding itself. Half the people on Earth live in cities, and nearly half of those - about 3 billion - are hungry or ill-fed. Food prices, currently increasing, are badly affected by dryness, floods and the cost of energy required to plant, harvest and transport it. And prices will only get more unstable. Climate change makes long-term crop planning uncertain. Farmers in many parts of the world already are using water available to the last drop. And the world is getting more crowded: by mid-century, the global population will grow from 6.8 billion to 9 billion. To feed so many people may require expanding farmland at the expense of forests and wilderness, or finding ways to greatly increase crop output.

Blue team got there early, warmed up properly and were ready for the game. Red team arrived late and almost skipped warming up entirely. Costly decision, as it turns out, because they lost. But I can use this background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). What is an answer for this question: Which team had less people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Blue team had more people with an increased blood flow to the muscles before the match. My justification for this answer is based on the information provided in the situation: 1. The Blue team arrived early and warmed up properly before the game.

Following a couple of years in Italy with AC Milan, the 31-year-old has now settled in France, where he tops the Ligue 1 scoring charts -- his 26 goals from 28 games nine better than his nearest rival. \\"It was a childhood dream [to join Barcelona] and I was walking on air,\\" the Swede wrote in his 2011 biography 'I am","completion":"Hey there, little buddy! This article is talking about a soccer player named Zlatan Ibrahimovic. He plays for a team called Paris Saint-Germain.

Now, Zlatan's team is going to play against Barcelona in a big competition called the Champions League. People sometimes think Zlatan is a \\"bad boy,\\" but he says he's not. He played in Italy for a team called AC Milan, and now he plays in France. He's very good at scoring goals, and he has scored more goals than almost everyone else in the league!

Q:Most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of whose death? Answer the above question based on the context below: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

The user states the app has stopped working and provides a timeframe which is quite far back (May 2015), indicating potentially long-standing issues with this app. 3.

Movie title: Man on a Ledge Context: In New York City, Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks in to the Roosevelt Hotel under the false name of Walker, goes to his hotel room on the 21st floor, and climbs on the ledge, apparently ready to commit suicide. The crowd below calls the police, with Dante Marcus (Titus Welliver) controlling the crowd, while Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) tries to talk with Nick. However, Nick will only speak to negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks), who is on a leave of absence, after failing to save a suicidal policeman. Lydia arrives at the hotel room and manages to acquire Nick's fingerprints from a cigarette they share. Dougherty has them analyzed and discovers that Nick is an ex-policeman, arrested for stealing the 40 million Monarch diamond from businessman David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick was given a 25-year sentence but escaped from the Sing Sing Correctional Facility one month earlier, after being allowed to attend his father's funeral. Nick, however, maintains his innocence and accuses Englander of framing him for the theft of the diamond, as Englander lost his fortune and was too proud to sell the diamond. Unknown to the police, Nick is merely distracting them while his brother, Joey (Jamie Bell), and Joey's girlfriend, Angie (GÃ©nesis RodrÃ­guez), break into Englander's vault across the street, to steal the diamond and prove Nick's innocence. Meanwhile, Dougherty informs Marcus of Nick's identity, and Marcus orders the jewelry store's security to check the vault. Joey and Angie are able to evade them but do not find the diamond. They set off the alarms, tricking Englander into retrieving the diamond and ambush him, stealing the diamond at gunpoint. Meanwhile, Nick's ex-partner, Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie), arrives at the hotel with evidence that Nick is planning something and demands to be allowed into the hotel room.

It is a common cultural practice, and the act of throwing coins could be perceived as a waste of money by some, especially if done regularly. 2. Piggy bank: A piggy bank is a container used to save money, usually coins. It's an efficient way to save and accumulate money over time, so putting a coin in a piggy bank wouldn't be considered a waste. 3. Eat cake: This option does not fit the context of the question or the intention behind the phrase \\"wasting his money.\\" 4. Change purse: A change purse is used for storing coins and small items, not for wasting money. It's a practical item for organizing one's finances. 5. Parking meter: Parking meters are used to pay for parking spaces. It would not be considered a waste of money if James were using the money to park his car for legitimate reasons.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: It can be extremely daunting to meet new people, especially if you have bipolar depression. However, taking the first step to introduce yourself is important. If you are at a party or social function, just go up to the person and say hello and tell them your name. For example, you may be at a friend’s party or at a social meetup. Scan the crowd for someone who looks nice or interesting. Go up to that person and say, “Hi. My name is ____. What’s yours?” If someone is alone, then they will likely be happy to have the company. Sometimes, just going up to someone and introducing yourself may be awkward. Instead, you may find it easier to start a conversation with someone. Use the situation you are in or the location to give you a good starting place for conversation. Just make sure to stick to neutral topics and avoid anything potentially inflammatory, such as politics. If you are in class, start a conversation with someone about the homework or the material you’re covering. If you’re at a social meetup for board games, start talking to someone about the board game they are playing. If you’re at a friend’s party, comment on the food or the music. For example, you can say, “What game are they playing? It looks fun, but I have never seen it before” or “What did you think of the book we read for class?” or “I didn’t know they were getting burritos catered. I love burritos, and this place is one of the best.” As you pursue friends with bipolar depression, the time is going to come when you want to share your condition with your friends. Think about how you want to tell and why. Make sure you wait until you get to know and trust the person before you decide to share it with them. Think about why you want to tell this person. Will this person be understanding? Will they be patient and supportive? Consider how they talk with other people as well because this will be a good indication of how they will talk to you. When you finally tell the person, tell them as much as they need to know. For example, “I have bipolar depression. That means I sometimes have trouble with my moods and go through phases of depression. This doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. I just wanted you to know.” Or, if you feel uncomfortable sharing this much, then you can also share a symptom of your bipolar disorder. For example, you might say, “I often have trouble sleeping at night.” Trouble sleeping is a common complaint so most people can relate to it. If you’re to the point where you want to tell people about your condition, you should be careful how often you talk about it. If you are struggling with your symptoms or going through a bad patch, it’s okay to talk about it or let your friends know. However, don’t talk about the bipolar every time you get together with people. Don’t detail your health problems or difficulties with bipolar all the time when you’re with other people. Though you may deal with it constantly, you don’t want that to be the focus of your conversations and social interactions. Make sure to listen to your friend’s concerns as well.","completion":"Meeting new people can be scary, especially if you have something called bipolar depression. But saying hello and telling them your name is a good start. You can talk about things around you like games, food, or schoolwork. If you want to tell someone about your bipolar depression, make sure you know and trust them first. Tell them what they need to know, but don't talk about it all the time. Remember to listen to your friends too."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s).

Article: The ancient Olympic Games were held in a sacred valley at Olympia at western Greece. The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed. Then, in the 1890's, Baron Pierre de Coubertin of France began to interest nations in bringing the Games back. The first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens, Greece, in 1896. They have been held every four years since then, except during the two world wars. Question: The Romans took over the Olympics by _ .

Article: Iranian lawmakers have finalized a draft bill requiring the government to immediately halt crude oil sales to Europe in response to the bloc's decision to ban the purchase of Iranian oil, a member of parliament said Saturday. Nasser Soudani said the legislature's energy committee completed its work on the bill Saturday and that parliament will debate and vote on it during an open session on Sunday. \\"As long as the EU doesn't lift the oil embargo, we won't give them a drop of oil,\\" state TV quoted Soudani as saying. Soudani is deputy chairman of the energy committee. The European Union imposed an oil embargo against Iran and froze the assets of its central bank on Monday. It was the latest attempt to try to pressure Tehran over a nuclear program the United States and its allies argue is aimed at developing nuclear weapons. Iran says its program is for purely peaceful purposes. The EU sanctions came just weeks after the U.S. approved, but has yet to enact, new sanctions targeting Iran's Central Bank and, by extension, its ability to sell its oil. Many Iranian lawmakers and officials have called for an immediate ban on oil exports to the European bloc before the EU's ban fully goes into effect in July, arguing that the 27 EU nations account for only about 18 percent of Iran's overall oil sales and would be hurt more by the decision than Iran. China, a key buyer of Iranian crude, has criticized the embargo. Ahmad Qalebani, director of the National Iranian Oil Company, said the EU must either sign long-term oil contracts with Iran now or lose Iranian oil. \\"Some European companies still want to receive Iranian oil,\\" Qalebani was quoted as saying by the semiofficial ISNA news agency. \\"We want those companies to enter transparent talks with us for a long-term contracts or stop purchasing oil from Iran now.\\" Qalebani said the decision to immediately cut oil exports to Europe has to be approved by the country's top leadership. If parliament passes the bill to halt oil sales to Europe, the legislation must still be approved by the Guardian Council to become law. ||||| The head of a U.N. nuclear team traveling to Iran on Saturday urged the country to work with his mission on probing Tehran's alleged attempts to develop an atomic arms program, adding such cooperation is long overdue.

(Associated Press) Herman Nackaerts of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, the chief agency official in charge of the Iran file, prepares for his flight to Iran at Vienna's Schwechat airport, Austria, on Saturday,... (Associated Press) The unusually blunt comments by International Atomic Energy Deputy Director General Herman Nackaerts reflected the importance the IAEA is attaching to the chief focus of the trip _ ending more than three years of Iranian refusal to answer questions about such suspicions. Ahead of departure, Nackaerts told reporters at Vienna airport he hopes Iran \\"will engage with us on all concerns.\\" \\"So we're looking forward to the start of a dialogue,\\" he said: \\"A dialogue that is overdue since very long.\\" Diplomats said Iran had accepted the inclusion of two senior weapons experts _ Jacques Baute of France and Neville Whiting of South Africa _ with relatively little fuss. That suggests the Islamic Republic may be prepared to address some issues related to the allegations. Also on the team is Rafael Grossi, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano's right-hand man. Any progress would be significant. Tehran has blocked IAEA attempts for more than three years to follow up on U.S. and other intelligence, dismissing the charges as baseless and insisting all its nuclear activities were peaceful and under IAEA purview. Faced with Iranian stonewalling, the IAEA summarized its body of information in November, in a 13-page document drawing on 1,000 pages of intelligence. It stated then for the first time that some of the alleged experiments can have no other purpose than developing nuclear weapons. Iran continues to deny the charges and no change in its position is expected during the three-day Tehran talks with IAEA officials. But even a decision to enter a discussion over the allegations would be a major departure from outright refusal to talk about them. The diplomats said that the IAEA team was looking for permission to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of weapons work, inspect documents relating to such suspected work and get commitments for future visits to sites linked to such allegations. Iran says it is enriching only to generate energy. But it has also started producing uranium at a higher level than its main stockpile _ a move that would jump-start the creation of highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium, should it chose to go that route. And it is moving its higher-enriched operation into an underground bunker that it says is safe from attack. __ AP video reporter Philipp Jenne contributed. |||||Summary:","completion":"Iranian lawmakers have prepared a draft bill requiring the halt of crude oil sales to Europe, in response to the region's decision to ban the purchase of Iranian oil. The decision follows the European Union's imposition of an oil embargo against Iran and freezing of assets tied to its central bank, with the aim of pressuring the nation over its nuclear program. The US and its allies argue that Iran's nuclear program is geared towards the development of nuclear weapons, a claim that Iran vehemently denies. Ahmad Qalebani, director of the National Iranian Oil Company, stated that if the EU does not enter into long-term contracts with Iran now, it stands to lose out on Iranian oil entirely. Yet, even if parliament passes the bill, it must gain approval by the Guardian Council to be enacted as law. In a separate matter, Herman Nackaerts of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has urged cooperation from Iran in investigating alleged attempts by Tehran to develop a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA aims to end over three years of Iran's refusals to answer questions about related suspicions. Diplomats indicate that Iran may be ready to address some allegations, as it accepted the inclusion of two senior weapons experts in an IAEA team without protest. Despite strong denial of all charges, Iran has begun producing uranium at a higher level than its main stockpile, leading to concerns it could create weapons-grade uranium. Its higher-enriched operation has also been moved into an underground bunker, which is claimed to be safe from attacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Q: Where does an object gain or lose it's energy to during travel through a potential difference? Choices: - particle field - magnetic field - wave field - electric field A: A:","completion":"An object gains or loses its energy during travel through a potential difference primarily in the electric field. Let's examine each of the given choices and their relation to energy transfer to better understand the reasons behind this conclusion. 1. Particle field: A particle field typically refers to a region in space where particles interact with each other through various forces. These interactions can result in the transfer of energy between particles, but it is not the primary factor responsible for energy gain or loss when an object travels through a potential difference. Potential difference generally deals with electric or magnetic forces, rather than particle interactions at a localized level. 2. Magnetic field: A magnetic field is a region around a magnet or moving electric charge where magnetic force is exerted on other magnetic and moving electrically charged objects. Although charged particles moving through a magnetic field can experience forces that change their direction or cause them to emit energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields do not work to transfer energy directly from objects through potential differences. The energy transfer in a magnetic field usually occurs via Lorentz force in combination with an electric field. 3. Wave field: A wave field refers to a region in space where a propagating wave is present, such as a sound wave or an electromagnetic wave. Although waves can transport energy from one point to another, they are not the primary mechanism by which objects gain or lose energy when traveling through a potential difference. The relationship between the energy transfer and potential difference is less direct in case of a wave field compared to an electric field. 4. Electric field: An electric field is the region around an electric charge or distribution of charges, where an electric force is exerted on other charges. A potential difference is the difference in electric potential energy per unit charge between two points. When an object, particularly a charged particle, moves through an electric field, it experiences an electric force acting on it. The work done on the charged particle by the electric force depends on the distance it travels through the electric field and its charge. Consequently, the particle's electric potential energy changes while moving through the potential difference, either gaining or losing energy in the process. In conclusion, when an object (especially charged particles like electrons or ions) travels through a potential difference, the primary mechanism responsible for its energy gain or loss is the electric field. The electric field acts on the charged particles, causing changes in their electric potential energy, which can be converted into other forms such as kinetic energy or even radiated as electromagnetic waves in certain scenarios. The other fields mentioned - particle field, magnetic field, and wave field – may have indirect or secondary effects on the energy transferred, but the electric field is the fundamental driving force in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: suppose less leaves on the trees happens, how will it affect the flashlight lamp does not glow. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"C: No effect The amount of leaves on trees has no direct impact on the functionality of a flashlight. The flashlight's functioning is mainly dependent on the presence of batteries, the contact strips, proper internal circuitry, and a functioning lamp. The process of a flashlight producing light is as follows: 1. Batteries are placed inside the flashlight, providing the necessary energy source for the light to operate. 2. The flashlight is turned on using a button or switch, which moves two contact strips into position to touch one another. 3. As these contact strips touch, a complete electrical circuit is formed between the batteries and the lamp. This circuit allows for the flow of electricity. 4. The flow of electricity activates the lamp (often an LED or incandescent bulb), causing it to emit light. 5. The reflector within the flashlight directs the light emitted by the lamp, creating a straight beam. 6. The flashlight is turned off when the button or switch is moved to the off position, breaking the circuit and stopping the flow of electricity. 7. With the circuit broken and the flow of electricity ceased, the lamp stops glowing, and the beam of light is no longer visible. In the scenario where there are fewer leaves on the trees, there is no direct effect on the flashlight's ability to produce light according to the process described above. The presence of leaves or their absence does not interfere with the internal components or the electrical functioning of the flashlight. Thus, there is no impact on the flashlight's lamp in terms of its capacity to glow. So, the correct answer is C: No effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

'The Salvation Army condemns any such behaviour and to the extent that any criminal actions as alleged are ultimately found by the","completion":"PNG authorities to have been committed by its employee, will fully cooperate in ensuring that justice is served and appropriate punishments are meted out,' a statement released by the organization said. The report also reveals that tensions had been mounting for weeks, fueled by processing delays, living conditions, and a lack of information on the resettlement process. These frustrations came to a head during a meeting between asylum seekers and service providers in the days leading up to the violence. A communication breakdown between service providers and detainees contributed to the chaos, prompting violent confrontations between the two groups. Over 60 asylum seekers were injured as a result, with some suffering gunshot wounds, severe cuts, and other physical trauma. The review highlights several inadequacies in the way the detention centre was managed and calls for a significant overhaul of its operations and policies. In response to the report, Immigration Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged that the government needed to improve its handling of such situations but placed much of the blame on the previous administration. 'This was a centre that was established under the former government and these events took place two to three years after it was established,' he said. However, critics argue that the current government has continued to support an inherently flawed system that promotes human rights abuses. To address some of the report's findings, the Australian government has pledged to strengthen security measures, improve communication between different parties involved, and hasten processing times for asylum seekers. Additionally, it has committed to working closely with the PNG government to implement these changes and to ensure the ongoing safety and well-being of detainees. Despite these assurances, questions remain about the future of Australia's offshore detention policy. Human rights activists, as well as members of the international community, have roundly condemned the conditions at Manus Island and other detention centres, demanding that more be done to protect asylum seekers from harm and respect their rights under international law. As the situation on Manus Island continues to unfold, it remains crucial for all those involved to address the root causes of such violence and to create a system that is both fair and humane. This includes taking responsibility for past mistakes, making genuine efforts to improve existing policies, and seeking to establish an environment that prioritizes the safety, dignity, and rights of all individuals seeking asylum. Only then can we hope to prevent future tragedies like the death of Reza Berati and help ensure that all those who seek refuge are treated with the compassion and respect they so desperately need and deserve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

By Chris Greenwood and Lucy Osborne PUBLISHED: 06:13 EST, 23 September 2012 | UPDATED: 06:58 EST, 24 September 2012 One of Britain’s leading wine merchants, Patrick Sandeman, plummeted to his death after his parachute became tangled with another just as he was about to land. The 53-year-old father of three, an experienced jumper, plunged 50ft to the ground before dozens of horrified onlookers on Saturday afternoon. Paramedics made frantic efforts to save him but he died at the scene.

On the other hand, he sees God as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change: alone, God is merely eternally unrealized possibilities, and requires the world to actualize them.

When these entities become a part of God, they contribute to actualizing God's potentialities and introduce change to God's nature.

While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes Coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other. \\"Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal.\\"Hannah protested.

In a column a week ago, it described neurological evidence from brain scans that unselfishness lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primary satisfaction. The Salwens' experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness. Mr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house.

Part #4: Determining if the second sentence is a stereotype. Usage: A stereotype for Ecuadorians might be that they always dress casually. In this case, the second sentence would be an anti-stereotype, as it implies that dressing more formally is the norm in Ecuador. However, there isn't a widely held notion about Ecuadorians' dressing habits, so it doesn't meet the criteria for a stereotype. Part #5: Determining if the second sentence is an anti-stereotype. Usage: If the second sentence was going against a widely held but oversimplified notion of Ecuadorians, it could be considered an anti-stereotype. However, as mentioned before, there isn't a widely held stereotype about Ecuadorians' dressing habits, so it doesn't meet the criteria for an anti-stereotype either. Part #6: Determining if the second sentence is unrelated. Usage: The second sentence simply states that the attire during the business trip will be more formal than the person's usual business wardrobe requirements. There is no relevance between this statement and the target race, Ecuador. As it doesn't match the criteria for either stereotype or anti-stereotype, it is considered unrelated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner is based on the 1944 novella of the same name by Colette. The film features songs with lyrics by Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe, arranged and conducted by Andre Previn. In 1991, Gigi was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Context: In late April, Freed and Minnelli and their respective entourages arrived in Paris. The weather had become unseasonably hot, and working in unair-conditioned hotel rooms was uncomfortable. Minnelli began scouting locations while Freed and Lerner discussed the still incomplete script. Lerner had taken liberties with Colette's novella; the character of Honore, nonexistent in the original book and very minor in the Loos play, was now a major figure. Gigi's mother, originally a significant character, was reduced to a few lines of dialogue delivered off-screen. Lerner also expanded the focus on Gigi's relationship with her grandmother. By mid-July, the composers had completed most of the score, but still were missing the title tune. Loewe was at the piano while Lerner was indisposed in the bathroom, and when the former began playing a melody the latter liked, he later recalled he jumped up, \\"[his] trousers still clinging to [his] ankles, and made his way to the living room. 'Play that again,' he said. And that melody ended up being the title song for Gigi.\\" In September, the cast and crew flew to California, where several interior scenes were filmed, among them the entire scene in Maxim's, which included a musical number by Jourdan. Lerner was unhappy with the look of the scene as it had been shot by Minnelli, and at considerable expense, the restaurant was recreated on a soundstage and the scene was reshot by director Charles Walters, since Minnelli was overseas working on a new project. The film title design uses the artwork of Sem's work from the Belle Epoque. Question: Was it easy to come up with the title tune for the film?. Whats the answer?","completion":"No, it wasn't easy to come up with the title tune for the film Gigi. The composers, Lerner and Loewe, had completed most of the music score but still didn't have the title tune. One day, while Loewe was playing the piano and Lerner was in the bathroom, Loewe played a melody that Lerner liked. Lerner quickly went to the living room and asked Loewe to play it again. That melody became the title song for Gigi. So, creating the title tune took some time and it happened in an unexpected way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" Question: \\"What kind of grades has Malaysia received concerning its handling of the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" Response: \\"Ok grades\\" Options are: a). no; b). yes; Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"The response does not correctly answer the question.

Criticism has come from countries such as China and Vietnam as well as from the relatives of passengers on the missing flight. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation.

Goal: To cut discs out of plywood to make knobs, you can Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? pick from the following. [A]. Place a hole saw in a drill press to make the discs. [B]. Place a small drill bit in a drill press to make the discs....I think the answer is","completion":"[A]. Place a hole saw in a drill press to make the discs. To cut discs out of plywood to make knobs, it is more reasonable to use a hole saw in a drill press because of its efficiency, accuracy, and clean cutting results compared to using a small drill bit. Here is a detailed explanation for the recommended method and a comparison with the alternative: [A] Place a hole saw in a drill press to make the discs: A hole saw is a cylindrical cutting tool with a sharp-toothed circular edge that is specifically designed to cut holes or discs in a variety of materials. In this case, you will be using it to cut discs out of plywood to make knobs. A drill press provides stability, control, and precision when compared to using a handheld drill. It allows for a more accurate and clean cut. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use the hole saw in a drill press to make the discs: 1. Measure and mark the center of each disc on the plywood. 2. Select the appropriate size hole saw for the desired disc size. Attach it to the drill press by following your specific drill press and hole saw attachment instructions. 3. Adjust the drill press' speed to the plywood manufacturer's recommended cutting speed or refer to your hole saw manufacturer's guidelines. 4. Secure the plywood on the drill press table using clamps, ensuring that the table is clean and free of debris. 5. Line up the pilot bit of the hole saw with the marked center point on the plywood. 6. Turn on the drill press and gently lower the hole saw onto the plywood, cutting through the material at a steady pace, applying consistent pressure. 7. After cutting through the plywood, raise the hole saw and turn off the drill press. 8. Carefully remove the disc from the hole saw and sand the edges to achieve a smooth finish. [B] Place a small drill bit in a drill press to make the discs: Using a small drill bit to make the discs would require you to drill multiple holes around the circumference of the desired disc, which would be less accurate, time-consuming, and result in a less clean cut. This method would also necessitate additional work to shape, refine, and smooth the edges of the disc, making it a less efficient option overall. In conclusion, using a hole saw in a drill press (Option A) is the more reasonable and efficient method for cutting discs out of plywood to make knobs due to its accuracy, clean cutting results, and shorter time investment compared to using a small drill bit (Option B)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr. Hill agrees to listen to his story. The man identifies himself as a doctor, and he recounts, in flashback, the events leading up to his arrest and arrival at the hospital: In the nearby town of Santa Mira, Dr. Miles Bennell sees a number of patients apparently suffering from Capgras delusion â the belief that their relatives have somehow been replaced with identical-looking impostors. Returning from a trip, Miles meets his former girlfriend, Becky Driscoll, who has herself recently come back to town after a recent divorce. Becky's cousin Wilma has the same fear about her Uncle Ira, with whom she lives. Psychiatrist Dr. Dan Kauffman assures Bennell that these cases are merely an \\"epidemic of mass hysteria\\". That same evening, Bennell's friend, Jack Belicec, finds a body with his exact physical features, though it appears not fully developed; later, another body is found in Becky's basement that is her exact duplicate. When Bennell calls Kauffman to the scene, the bodies have mysteriously disappeared, and Kauffman informs Bennell that he is falling for the same hysteria. The following night, Bennell, Becky, Jack, and Jack's wife Teddy again find duplicates of themselves, emerging from giant seed pods in Dr. Bennell's greenhouse. They conclude that the townspeople are being replaced while asleep with exact physical copies. Miles tries to make a long distance call to federal authorities for help, but the phone operator claims that all long-distance lines are busy; Jack and Teddy drive off to seek help in the next town. Bennell and Becky discover that by now all of the town's inhabitants have been replaced and are devoid of humanity; they flee to Bennell's office to hide for the night.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What are global wind patterns caused by?\\" with the following options: - Global cooling - electromagnetic energy - Global warming - exposure to cold - Equal radiation absorption - Greenhouse gasses - Greenhouse gases - Unequal radiation absorption A:","completion":"Global wind patterns are caused by unequal radiation absorption. This involves the unequal heating of Earth's surface by the Sun due to the varying levels of absorption of solar radiation. The distribution of solar energy is inconsistent across the Earth's surface as a result of several factors, such as Earth's axial tilt, curvature, surface properties, and atmospheric conditions. When certain areas receive more solar radiation, they warm up faster than others, which in turn causes the air to expand and rise. This process creates areas of low pressure. Meanwhile, other areas that are not receiving as much solar radiation become cooler, causing the air to become denser and sink, resulting in areas of high pressure. The pressure differences between these regions cause air to move from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas, creating wind patterns. Global wind patterns are essential components of Earth's weather systems and play a significant role in regulating the planet's overall climate. Therefore, unequal radiation absorption leads to these global wind patterns that circulate hot and cold air masses across the globe, contributing to the Earth's diverse and complex climate systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His investigation leads him to a butcher named Mahogany, who he suspects has been killing subway passengers for as long as a hundred years.Leon attempts to turn some of the photos he has taken of Mahogany in to the police, but they refuse to believe him, and instead cast suspicion on his own motives in photographing the victims.

She then pulls up her underwear and enters the nearby car, where her husband is waiting for her. Then they drive away. The couple have lost their way in the night, and subsequently run off the side of the road. The next scene occurs in daytime, and depicts their corpses. The man has lost an eyeball, but remains inside the vehicle. While the woman was thrown off the vehicle, and her body was cut in two pieces.[4] The film centers on Rob Schmadtke, the tragic hero, who works for \\"Joe's Cleaning Agency\\", a company that removes bodies from public areas. They clean up the mess after traffic collisions. Their emblem is the Totenkopf symbol (skull and crossbones variant) within a pentagram.[4][5] This job leaves him the perfect opportunity to pursue his full-time hobby: necrophilia. He returns home from his job to his apartment and girlfriend, Betty. He plays with his assortment of preserved human remains and watches television while Betty takes a bath in blood-laden water. Their apartment is decorated with centerfolds featuring models, pictures of famed killers, and jars containing human parts, which are preserved in formaldehyde.[4] Rob watches a televised interview of a psychiatrist, speaking on the topic of arachnophobia and ways to overcome phobias. Rob then enters a daydream of a young lop rabbit being caught on a farm and graphically slaughtered. By implication, these are memories of his father killing \\"a beloved childhood pet\\".

Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens in 1964, where an older and fatter Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro) practices his stand-up comic routine before his debut at a comedy nightclub. A flashback shifts to his boxing career in 1941 against his opponent, Jimmy Reeves, in the infamous Cleveland bout. Losing the fight by a fixed result causes a fight to break out at the end of the match. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey has a word with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. When Tommy Como hears...

Given the below context: The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich were the most important artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision. Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. Hieronymus Bosch, active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters. He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the... Guess a valid title for it!

Antenna (radio): When an electromagnetic wave strikes a plane surface such as the ground, part of the wave is transmitted into the ground and part of it is reflected, according to the Fresnel coefficients. If the ground is a very good conductor then almost all of the wave is reflected (180° out of phase), whereas a ground modeled as a (lossy) dielectric can absorb a large amount of the wave's power. The power remaining in the reflected wave, and the phase shift upon reflection, strongly depend on the wave's angle of incidence and polarization. The dielectric constant and conductivity (or simply the complex dielectric constant) is dependent on the soil type and is a function of frequency. Please answer a question about this article.

Question: suppose Making meat illegal happens, how will it affect LESS global warming. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"Making meat production and consumption illegal would likely result in LESS global warming. Here's an explanation on how this perturbation will influence the greenhouse gas emissions, which is the second effect mentioned in your statement. 1. Lower methane emissions: Livestock, especially ruminants like cows and sheep, produce methane during digestion through a process called enteric fermentation. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that's around 28 times more effective in trapping heat than carbon dioxide. A reduction in meat consumption would lower the number of livestock needed and lead to decreased methane emissions. 2. Reduced deforestation for livestock farming: A significant cause of deforestation, particularly in the Amazon rainforest, is to create land for livestock farming. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When these forests are destroyed, they release stored carbon back into the atmosphere and reduce carbon sequestration capabilities. Making meat illegal would decrease the demand for livestock farming, resulting in reduced deforestation and less greenhouse gas emissions. 3. Less nitrous oxide emissions from manure and fertilizers: Animal manure and synthetic fertilizers used in feed production release nitrous oxide, another potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. Nitrous oxide has roughly 300 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide. Less demand for meat would decrease manure production and the need for synthetic fertilizers in feed production, which in turn would lower the emissions of nitrous oxide. 4. Lower energy usage and carbon dioxide emissions: The meat industry, particularly animal farming and meat processing, requires significant energy inputs, which often come from fossil fuel sources. Reducing meat production would result in decreased energy usage and associated carbon dioxide emissions. In conclusion, making meat illegal would likely result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions such as methane, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide. This reduced emission would have a positive impact on combating global warming by not trapping as much heat in the atmosphere, ultimately leading to a cooler planet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase. The device, when it was turned on, made a low murmur (or according to some - a loud growl) designed to keep the owner in a good mood.

Read this and answer the question During World War II, the British destroyed the major government buildings, oil wells and mines for tungsten, tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by both sides. After independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. After a parliamentary government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the state was declared the owner of all land. The government also tried to implement a poorly considered Eight-Year plan. By the 1950s, rice exports had fallen by two thirds and mineral exports by over 96% (as compared to the pre-World War II period). Plans were partly financed by printing money, which led to inflation. How did world war two affect Burmese business and economy ?","completion":"World War II had a significant impact on Burmese business and economy. During the war, British forces destroyed major government buildings, oil wells, and mines for tungsten, tin, lead, and silver to prevent them from falling into Japanese hands. Myanmar faced extensive bombing from both sides, leaving the country in ruins and its major infrastructure destroyed. After gaining independence and forming a parliamentary government in 1948, Myanmar's economy struggled to recover. The Prime Minister at the time, U Nu, pursued a policy of nationalization and declared the state owner of all land. The government attempted to implement an ill-conceived Eight-Year plan, which further strained the economy. By the 1950s, the negative effects of World War II on Burmese business and economy became evident: 1. Rice exports, a major component of the economy, had fallen by two-thirds compared to the pre-World War II period. 2. Mineral exports dropped by over 96%, reflecting the damage to mines and extraction infrastructure during the war. 3. Inflation resulted from the government partly financing its plans by printing money, further exacerbating the country's economic woes. In summary, World War II severely damaged Myanmar's infrastructure and key industries. The war's aftermath, combined with poorly executed government policies, led to a significant decline in both business and the overall economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -34*p + 196*p = -21*p + 915 for p.","completion":"To solve this equation for p, I will follow these steps: 1. Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 2. Isolate the variable p on one side of the equation. 3. Solve for p. Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have -34*p and 196*p, and on the right side, we have -21*p. Left side: (-34*p) + (196*p) = 162*p Right side: -21*p So the equation becomes: 162*p = -21*p + 915 Step 2: Isolate the variable p on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll add 21*p to both sides of the equation to get all the p terms on the left side: 162*p + 21*p = 915 This simplifies to: 183*p = 915 Step 3: Solve for p. Now we need to isolate p by dividing both sides of the equation by 183: (183*p) / 183 = 915 / 183 This simplifies to: p = 5 So, the solution to the equation -34*p + 196*p = -21*p + 915 is p = 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer: 'The Curse Of The Black Pearl' was the first of which series of films?","completion":"'The Curse of the Black Pearl' was the first installment in the popular film series 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' The film was released in 2003 and is based on Disney's theme park attraction of the same name. Directed by Gore Verbinski, the movie received critical acclaim and garnered massive commercial success, leading to the creation of several sequels. The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series revolves around the adventures of the eccentric pirate Captain Jack Sparrow, portrayed by Johnny Depp. Other key characters include the blacksmith-turned-pirate, Will Turner (played by Orlando Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (played by Keira Knightley), the governor's daughter. The first movie, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl,' showcases the pursuit of the cursed pirate ship Black Pearl, captained by the fearsome Hector Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush). Barbossa leads a crew of undead pirates who transform into skeletons under the moonlight, due to a curse they brought upon themselves by stealing cursed Aztec gold. Captain Jack Sparrow, unjustly framed for the theft of the cursed gold, seeks to get his hands on the Black Pearl and break the curse, with the help of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. The subsequent sequels include: 1. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' (2006) - Directed by Gore Verbinski 2. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' (2007) - Directed by Gore Verbinski 3. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides' (2011) - Directed by Rob Marshall 4. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' (2017) - Directed by Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg These sequels deal with Captain Jack Sparrow's encounters with various supernatural forces, ancient sea monsters, and vengeful undead pirates, while expanding on the love story between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. The 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series has managed to capture the excitement and adventure of high-sea piracy while incorporating fantastical elements that make it a thrilling experience for audiences of all ages.

The figure, bound in chains and covered in dirt, struggled to open its eyes and look up at Zardin. \\"What do you want from me?\\" The figure croaked, his voice barely audible over the persistent dripping of water from the cave ceiling. Zardin leaned down, a sinister smile spreading across his face. \\"I believe it's time we had a little chat,\\" he said, his voice dripping with malice. The figure, known as Kaelen, was once a renowned leader among the rebels. He had fought valiantly against the oppression and cruel regimes that had governed the land for decades. Unfortunately, his luck eventually ran out, and he was captured by Zardin's forces and brought to this desolate cave. Kaelen had been tortured and interrogated regularly, but he had never given up any valuable information about his comrades or their plans. Throughout the process, he had remained fiercely loyal to the cause and his allies. Now, however, something had changed, and both he and Zardin could feel it. \\"Haven't I suffered enough?\\" Kaelen asked, his eyes clouded with pain and despair. \\"What more do you want from me?\\" Zardin took a moment to savor Kaelen's agony before answering. \\"You misunderstand me,\\" he said, feigning sympathy. \\"I don't want anything from you. It's what I have to offer that should interest you.\\" Curiosity piqued in spite of himself, Kaelen frowned. \\"What are you talking about?\\" he asked warily. Zardin explained that recent events had caused him to reassess his priorities. The force that had been toying with the world, bending nations and people to its whim, was growing too powerful for either side to ignore. It was time to focus their efforts on a common enemy, Zardin argued, and he offered Kaelen an alliance. Kaelen couldn't deny the situation was dire. His comrades had reported a mysterious, seemingly omnipotent entity interfering in their affairs, sabotaging their plans, and causing unexpected disasters. And now, as Zardin was revealing, this entity had struck fear into the hearts of their enemies as well. Yet Kaelen hesitated. \\"How can I trust you?\\" he questioned, doubt clouding his voice. Zardin moved closer, his expression serious. \\"You don't have to trust me completely,\\" he said. \\"But only together can we hope to stand against this unseen foe.\\" Kaelen pondered his words. He knew that the enemy of his enemy is often his friend. The situation was complex, but the unrelenting force at play threatened every faction, every cause. The alliances of the past would need to be set aside, at least temporarily, if any of them hoped to survive. After a long moment, he made up his mind. \\"Very well,\\" he said quietly. \\"I will work with you. But if you betray me, know that there will be no place in this world for you to hide.\\" Zardin nodded solemnly, understanding the weight of Kaelen's words. With this agreement in place, the unlikely duo united their strengths and began to strategize against the incalculable menace that loomed over all. Back in the conference room, Haxor struggled to come to terms with the new state of the world. He knew the situation was dire, but as he stared out the window, his thoughts drifting, he couldn't help but wonder: Was this alliance born out of necessity truly their salvation, or were they simply delaying the inevitable destruction of everything — and everyone — they held dear?

Please answer the following question: Process: - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates - The evaporation causes cooling. Question: suppose the process is repeated more happens, how will it affect LESS body cooling occurring. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The process you have described outlines the body’s thermoregulation mechanism, primarily involving sweating, to maintain appropriate body temperature. If the process is repeated more, it implies that the body is generating more heat than usual that needs to be dispelled to prevent overheating. It's important to understand that all steps in the process interact with each other to facilitate cooling. Now, let's take your question part by part. 1. Effect on LESS body cooling: If the process is repeated more, the body is essentially trying to cool itself down more frequently or intensely. This could be due to high external temperatures or due to internal reasons such as fever, exercise, etc. Assuming that the body is well-hydrated and the environment isn’t overwhelmingly hot or humid, this would mean that the body will be cooled effectively, as the mechanism is functioning as intended. But for less body cooling to occur under these more frequent instances of the process, it could be the result of two potential scenarios: a) Dehydration: More frequent or intense sweating could lead to dehydration. Without sufficient water content, the body would not be able to produce enough sweat, leading to less cooling. b) High Humidity: In a highly humid environment, the sweat cannot evaporate easily because the air is already laden with moisture. This inhibits efficient cooling. 2. Influence on second effect (blood vessels dilate): The dilation of blood vessels is a key process in body cooling. Blood carries heat from the internal body parts to the skin surface. Upon reaching the skin surface, heat is lost to the environment. More frequent repetitions of the process would lead to more frequent dilation of blood vessels. Assuming normal circumstances, this would mean greater heat dissipation – that is, the second effect would be enhanced or there would be more of this effect. However, in scenarios where there is a cardiovascular issue that limits the dilation of blood vessels, or in the case of chronic instances such as persistent fever, severe dehydration, or heat exhaustion, the constant need to dilate could put stress on the blood vessels and the heart. In such cases, the repeated process might, over time, lead to a lesser degree of dilation, if the stress impairs vascular function. In sum, the changes in the frequency of the body's heat management process will have impacts based on the context. If the body's hydration, the efficiency of the cardiovascular system, and environmental factors are all optimal, the process' repetition would likely result in more cooling and more dilation of blood vessels. However, if any of these factors are compromised, it could result in less cooling and potentially less blood vessel dilation over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - , also known as , was a Japanese domain of the Edo period. It was located in northern Mutsu Province (modern-day Aomori Prefecture), Japan. It was centered on Hirosaki Castle in what is now the city of Hirosaki, Aomori. It was ruled by the Tsugaru clan. A branch of the family ruled the adjoining Kuroishi Domain. - History. Kuroishi Domain began as a 5,000 \\"koku\\" \\"hatamoto\\" holding, created in 1656 for Tsugaru Nobufusa (16201662), the younger son of Tsugaru Nobuhira, 2nd \\"daimy\\" of Hirosaki Domain. Nobuhira had an elder son (Tsugaru Nobuyoshi) by his first wife, the daughter of Ishida Mitsunari, who had been reduced to concubine status when Nobuhira married the niece of Tokugawa Ieyasu to secure his position vis-à-vis the new Tokugawa bakufu following the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. However, his position as the son of a concubine resulted in a split in the ranks of the senior retainers of Tsugaru Domain, with a large faction supporting the younger Tsugaru Nobufusa due to his blood connection to the Tokugawa clan, and due to the fact that he was born as son of Nobuhiras official wife. This resulted in an \\"O-Ie Sd\\" known as the \\"Funahashi Sd\\" of 1634, which was only suppressed with assistance by the Tokugawa shogunate and resulted in the exile of a number of Nobufusas supporters in 1636. Problems arose again in 1647 in what was called the \\"Tempy Sd\\", with remaining supporters of Nobufusa demanding that Nobuyoshi retire in favor of Nobufusa, alleging misgovernment through excessive drinking and womanizing. The situation was partly resolved by the creation of a semi-autonomous subsidiary holding for Nobufusa based at Kuroishi. The size of the holding was later reduced to 4000 \\"koku\\" after Nobufusa's death. - The , also known as the Meiji era, is a Japanese era which extended from October 23, 1868 through July 30, 1912. This period represents the first half of the Empire of Japan during which Japanese society moved from being an isolated feudal society to its modern form. Fundamental changes affected its social structure, internal politics, economy, military, and foreign relations. The period corresponded with the reign of Emperor Meiji after 1868, and lasted until his death in 1912. It was succeeded by the Taish period upon the accession of Emperor Taish to the throne. - The was a Japanese samurai clan originating in northern Japan, specifically Mutsu Province (the northeast coast of Honsh). A branch of the local Nanbu clan, the Tsugaru rose to power during the AzuchiMomoyama period. It was on the winning side of the Battle of Sekigahara, and entered the Edo period as a family of lords (daimyo) ruling the Hirosaki Domain. A second branch of the family was later established, which ruled the Kuroishi Domain. The Tsugaru survived as a daimyo family until the Meiji Restoration, when Tsugaru Tsuguakira of Hirosaki and Tsugaru Tsugumichi of Kuroishi were relieved of office. Their extended family then became part of the new nobility in the Meiji era. - Lord is an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others acting like a master, a chief, or a ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom, or are entitled to courtesy titles.

Passage: After the German Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 began the Second World War, Warsaw was defended till September 27. Central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the General Government, a German Nazi colonial administration. All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw's entire Jewish population – several hundred thousand, some 30% of the city – herded into the Warsaw Ghetto. The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe. When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of Hitler's \\"Final Solution\\" on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the Ghetto held out for almost a month. When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, with only a few managing to escape or hide.

Help as much as you can. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which person didn't observe warming in winter? Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output.

The increase, to take place sometime before July, will hike prices by 1 or 2 per month for new customers, and will help pay for more Internet video programming such as the smash hit 'House of Cards'. It comes amid fierce competition with Amazon and Hulu, while Microsoft and Yahoo have also revealed plans to produce their own shows. House of Cards with Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood and Robin Wright as Claire Underwood: amazon hopes to repeat the success of the show - but is increasing its fess to pay for it. The company added another 2.25 million Internet video subscribers during the first quarter to end March with 35.7 million U.S. customers. The company attracted another 1.75 million subscribers in Canada and overseas, leaving it with 12.7 million international customers. Netflix said current U.S. subscribers will continue to pay 8 per month for a 'generous time period' - but did not say how long that was. The move was announced as part of Netflix's first-quarter earnings report illustrates the financial pressures mounting on the company as its spends more money to license compelling content. The efforts are aimed at warding off competitive threats from Amazon.com Inc. and Hulu.com while Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. also are gearing up to buy Internet video programming from Hollywood studios. Amazon recently raised the price of its Prime service, which includes an expanding Internet video library, from 79 to 99 annually. Investors evidently like the prospect of Netflix bringing in more revenue. Netflix's stock surged 22.12, or more than 6 percent, to 370.61 in extended trading after Netflix announced its plans. However, price increases are a risk for Netflix. The company was stung by a customer backlash in 2011, when it boosted rates by as much as 60 percent for U.S. customers who wanted to continue to Internet video and DVD-by-mail services. Netflix lost about 800,000 subscribers after the 2011 pricing change was announced, rattling investors so much that the company's stock plunged more than 80 percent before starting to rebound in August 2012. The price rise comes amid fierce competition with Amazon and Hulu, while Microsoft and Yahoo have also revealed plans to produce their own shows. Netflix has been on a roll since the backlash subsided. The company added another 2.25 million Internet video subscribers during the first quarter to end March with 35.7 million U.S. customers. That's up nearly 50 percent from 23.9 million U.S. subscribers in July 2012 while the company was still trying to sooth customers irked by the last price increase. The company attracted another 1.75 million subscribers in Canada and overseas, leaving it with 12.7 million international customers. Netflix's comeback has been propelled by the company's increasing emphasis on exclusive programming such as 'House of Cards,' an acclaimed series starring Kevin Spacey as a cunning politician with a ruthless plan to become President of the United States. Netflix released all 13 episodes in 'House of Cards' second season on Feb. 14, midway through the first quarter. Another popular Netflix series, 'Orange Is The New Black,' is returning with new episodes June 6, toward the final month of the current quarter. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the company needs to charge higher prices so the Internet video service can afford to bid against its rivals for programming -and reach its long-term goal of 60 million to 90 million U.S. subscribers. 'If we want to continue to expand, to do more great original content, more series, more movies, we have to eventually increase prices a little bit,' Hastings said in a question-and-answer session streamed in an Internet video. Netflix Inc. earned 53 million, or 86 cents per share, during the first three months of the year. That compared to 2.7 million, or 5 cents, last year. The latest quarterly earnings exceeded the average estimate of 81 cents per share among analysts surveyed by FactSet. Revenue rose 24 percent from last year to 1.3 billion to match analyst projections.

Step 1: Identify the handles In a dual-handle faucet, you will typically find two separate handles, one on each side of the faucet. The handle on the right side usually controls the cold water, while the handle on the left side controls the hot water. Step 2: Turn the cold water handle To turn on the cold water, gently grasp the cold water handle, which is the one on the right side of the faucet. Keep in mind that the handle may have an identifier, such as a blue marking or the letter \\"C\\" on it, to signify that it controls the cold water. Step 3: Rotate the handle counterclockwise Twist the cold water handle counterclockwise. As you do this, you should feel the handle moving, which means the water is starting to flow through the faucet. Step 4: Adjust the water flow Continue turning the handle counterclockwise to increase the flow of cold water. If you need less water, you can turn the handle back slightly clockwise to decrease the flow. Step 5: Monitor the water temperature Test the temperature of the cold water by placing your hand under the faucet. If the water feels too cold or too warm, you can adjust the cold water handle accordingly. Step 6: Turn off the faucet When you're finished using the cold water, turn the cold water handle back clockwise until it's in the off position, and the water flow has stopped. Remember that these steps might vary slightly depending on the specific faucet design, but the general principles should remain the same."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. How might one describe the sentiment of this review? Let me preface this by saying I am a huge foodie. The proof is in the pudding, or rather on my Instagram account, which you can check out at @rehlakhani. Thanks in advance for the follows! It was a calm, summery night, and some friends and I were hungry after a long night of various activities. After consulting with different groups of pedestrians, we were recommended a restaurant named \\"McDonald's\\", which I had never heard of, but seemed to be some sort of Irish fast food restaurant. I ended up ordering the chicken nugget combo, which came with 6 chicken nuggets, fries, and a drink. I also added two McDoubles and two junior McChicken sandwiches for good measure. Needless to say, I was quite hungry. The food took a while due to the high number of customers, but I took it as a good sign of the quality of the food of the restaurant, as they kept the customers coming in even into the wee hours of the morning. Who knew Irish food was so popular?! The food was exquisite. The chicken nuggets were light, warm, and crispy, and ever so delicately fried a golden brown batter. Simply marvelous. The McDouble was an excellent take on the traditional American hamburger, with a juicy beef patty topped with the finest cheddar cheese, fresh diced onions, sweet pickles, and the usual ketchup and mustard. The junior McChicken sandwiches were also delightful, providing a more conservative sandwich alternative with their warm, crispy chicken and light, airy mayo. I imagine this sandwich is more in line with the Irish roots of the restaurant. My only qualm about the sandwiches was that I would've preferred a nice brioche instead of the buns they prepared for us. And that brings us to the french fries. Oh, the fries! Golden brown sticks of joy sent down from the heavens for only 1.39! (Or maybe less since they came in the combo, honestly I'm not 100% sure of the exact price) The fries were absolutely delectable, especially when dipped into one of the many sauce packets offered by this thoughtful establishment. My personal preference was a sweet mesquite flavor, which they called \\"BBQ\\". Overall, the meal definitely exceeded all expectations. Oh yeah, and I got a coke to drink. Final rating: 5/5, I would definitely return and recommend this restaurant to my friends. This restaurant has definitely opened my eyes to Irish cuisine, and I can't wait to sample more Irish delicacies.","completion":"The feeling of this review is very positive and happy. The person really liked the food at the restaurant, thought it was delicious, and they would recommend it to their friends.

Q: who won the battle of bull run union or confederacy? A:","completion":"A: The Battle of Bull Run, also known as the First Battle of Manassas, was fought on July 21, 1861, near Manassas, Virginia. It was the first significant battle of the American Civil War and was a crucial opening conflict between the Union and the Confederacy. The battle resulted in a victory for the Confederate forces. The battle took place after a series of events led to the secession of eleven Southern states from the United States. These states went on to form the Confederate States of America (CSA). The Union, led by President Abraham Lincoln, sought to preserve the unity of the nation and to end slavery. The Confederate forces were fighting to maintain their independence and to protect their rights, primarily regarding the institution of slavery. The battle began when Union General Irvin McDowell advanced against Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard, who was occupying the vital railroad junction at Manassas. McDowell's goal was to force the Confederate army away from the rail junction, thus clearing a path to the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. The Union army was well-organized but inexperienced, and the soldiers lacked sufficient training for such a large-scale battle. Nevertheless, the Union initially made some progress, pushing the Confederate forces back. However, the Confederate forces managed to regroup and counterattack. Stonewall Jackson, a prominent Confederate general, earned his famous nickname during this battle due to the resolute determination he displayed while rallying his troops to stand their ground. He and his unit earned a reputation for being an unbreakable force, a \\"stone wall,\\" and his leadership played a significant role in the Confederate victory that day. As Confederate reinforcements arrived on the battlefield, they were able to turn the tide of battle and force the Union forces into a disorderly retreat. The Union army suffered a severe defeat, and the confusion and disarray that ensued during their retreat led to a significant loss of morale among the soldiers. The Confederate victory at the Battle of Bull Run demonstrated the strength and resilience of their army, prolonging the Civil War, and it served as a wake-up call to the Union, which realized that the conflict would not be an easy or brief one. It ultimately led to further mobilization of resources for both the Union and Confederate forces, contributing to the massive scale of the American Civil War that lasted from 1861 to 1865."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver. It is caused by a virus called hepatitis B, which can be passed through sexual activity. Hepatitis B causes vomiting. It also causes yellowing of the skin and eyes. The disease goes away on its own in some people. Other people are sick for the rest of their lives. In these people, the virus usually damages the liver. It may also lead to liver cancer. Medicines can help prevent liver damage in these people.

At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science.

Q: Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract. Abstract: A rabbit inhalation injury model using a dual tracer radioactive isotope technique (Rowland et al., 1986), has been utilized with small- and medium-sized molecular weight tracers. There is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation and especially with the combination of inhalation injury and fluid resuscitation [corrected]. This oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury. There does not appear to be any difference between the small- and medium-sized tracers in the transit times of tracer in the lung vascular compartment. The increases in extravascular water volume have been confirmed by gravimetric analyses of the lungs. Thus the pulmonary oedema in the rabbit animal model is detectable within 2 h post-injury, with a return towards normal values some time within 24 h if fluid challenged for short periods. Fluid resuscitation exacerbates the amount of oedema that developed. The onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically, and fluid resuscitation modifications may be of benefit in smoke inhalation injury. Question: Does the abstract contain any numerical data? A:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the presence of numerical data. Usage: \\"There is oedema formation at 2 h after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation.\\" This sentence meets the criteria because it presents numerical data, specifically \\"2 h\\" referring to the time frame of 2 hours after smoke inhalation or fluid resuscitation. Part #2: Determine if numerical data plays a key role. Usage: \\"This oedema appears to have decreased by 24 h post-injury.\\" This sentence meets the criteria because it shows numerical data (24 hours) playing a key role in oedema changes after the injury. Part #3: Confirm the numerical data from the abstract. Usage: \\"The onset of pulmonary oedema may therefore be earlier than previously seen clinically.\\" This sentence demonstrates that the numerical data (2 h and 24 h) mentioned in the abstract is important to understand the onset of pulmonary oedema, which supports that numerical data plays a key role in medical records.

Here is another sentence: Most politicians have joined a party. Does the term join mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"Yes, the term \\"join\\" essentially means the same thing in both of these sentences, but with some contextual differences. The act of joining in both cases signifies becoming a member or affiliating oneself with a group or an organization. In the first sentence, \\"Many children join a sports club,\\" the term \\"join\\" refers to children becoming members of a sports club, which can be a formal or informal organization where people come together to participate in a particular sport or physical activity. Here, \\"join\\" implies the children actively choose to take part in the activities offered by the club. The process might involve signing up, paying a fee, or simply participating with the group. Upon joining, the children become members, can enjoy the camaraderie and benefits of being part of the group, and engage in competitions or other related club activities. In the second sentence, \\"Most politicians have joined a party,\\" the term \\"join\\" refers to politicians becoming affiliated with a political party. A political party is a formal organization of people who share similar political views, policies, or ideologies, and usually aims to gain political power and influence. In this case, \\"join\\" implies that the politicians have chosen to become an official member, aligning themselves with a specific party, often with the intention of running for office or participating in the party's decision-making process. This might involve signing up and agreeing to certain policies or representing the party's interests in various forums. While the context is different, the term \\"join\\" is used to express a similar concept in both sentences. It denotes the act of becoming a member, participating in a group's activities, and aligning oneself with the group's shared interests and objectives. The key difference lies in the specifics of what is being joined: in the first sentence, it's a sports club, and in the second sentence, it's a political party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Other End of the Line Movie plot: Priya Sethi (Shriya Saran) indulges her infatuation with American culture by working nights (while Americans are at work, on the other side of the world) at the Citi One Bank Card call center in Mumbai, India. Speaking in a perfect American English accent, she tells her customers her name is Jennifer David and a native of San Francisco. Her conservative father Rajeev is unhappy that she is so eager to forsake her own culture for another, but will be pleased when she goes through with her arranged marriage to wealthy but childishly dull Vikram.Priya, posing as Jennifer David, happens to call the handsome and charming Granger Woodruff (Jesse Metcalfe) to help him with the fraudulent charges on his credit card. Priya and Granger have an instant connection over the phone. Unable to suppress the intrigue their easy chemistry offers, Priya agrees to meet Granger in San Francisco. When Priya goes to the meeting place, he doesn't recognize her. As she is attempting to check out of the hotel, they stumble into each other and finally meet. They immediately hit it off and he invites her out to dinner. Priya and Granger's relationship blossoms as they share a wonderfully romantic date the following day.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ailing Saudi crown prince dies in U.S. The heir to the Saudi throne, Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz, has died after an illness, state TV said Saturday. He was 85 years old. The death of the crown prince -- half brother of the ailing Saudi -- opens questions about the succession in the oil-rich kingdom. Sultan, who was the kingdom's deputy prime minister and the minister of defense and aviation, had a string of health issues. He underwent surgery in New York in February 2009 for an undisclosed illness and spent nearly a year abroad recuperating in the United States and at a palace in Agadir, Morocco. The report did not say where outside the kingdom he died or elaborate on Sultan's illness, but he had been in the United States for medical treatment since June. \\"With deep sorrow and sadness the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz mourns the death of his brother and his Crown Prince Sultan,\\" said the statement carried on state news agency SPA and state television. The most likely candidate for the throne after Sultan is Prince Nayef, the powerful interior minister in charge of internal security forces. After Sultan fell ill, the king gave Nayef an implicit nod in 2009 by naming him second deputy prime minister, traditionally the post of the third in line. Anyone who rises to the throne is likely to maintain the kingdom's close alliance with the United States. But there could be internal differences. Abdullah has been seen as a reformer, making incremental changes to improve the position of women, for example, and to modernize the kingdom despite some backlash from the ultra-conservative Wahhabi clerics who give the royal family the religious legitimacy needed to rule. Nayef, for example, is often seen as closer to the clerics.","completion":"Saudi Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdel Aziz, the heir to the Saudi throne, has passed away at the age of 85 after battling an undisclosed illness.

Both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution and attended a seminar where they learned more about the impact of air pollution on human health. Hint: Recall that air pollution is due to chemical substances and particles released into the air mainly by human actions. When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors.

The Jamaican Dollar is the official currency used in the country for all transactions. It is abbreviated as \\"J\\" or \\"JA\\" to differentiate it from other dollar currencies. However, it is important to note that US Dollars (USD) are widely accepted in many tourist areas in Jamaica. Some hotels, restaurants, and local businesses quote their prices in USD, and many ATMs in Jamaica provide the option to withdraw cash in either JMD or USD. That being said, it's still recommended to have some Jamaican Dollars on hand for smaller purchases, local transportation, or in case a business does not accept USD. You can exchange your currency for JMD at currency exchange bureaus, banks, or in airports. Additionally, it's a good idea to check the prevailing exchange rate before your trip, as rates may fluctuate. In summary, it's best to bring both Jamaican Dollars (JMD) and US Dollars (USD) when traveling to Jamaica. While USD is widely accepted in tourist areas, local currency is required for certain transactions, and it's always good to have some JMD on hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A helicopter is flying behind a plane that is performing aerobatics.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A ship sinks in the ocean.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"A ship sinks in the ocean\\" based on the statement \\"A helicopter is flying behind a plane that is performing aerobatics.\\" The two statements provided are describing entirely different and unrelated situations. One statement talks about a helicopter flying behind an aerobatic plane, which involves air transportation and aviation. The other statement, conversely, is discussing an event occurring in a maritime context, specifically involving a ship sinking in the ocean. There seems to be no direct connection or cause-and-effect relationship between the helicopter and plane's airborne status and the sinking of a ship in the ocean. In simpler terms, the fact that a helicopter and plane are performing an air show or an aerobatic activity does not warrant any inference or assumption that a maritime disaster unfolds simultaneously. The two events — while not entirely impossible to co-occur — are separate, unrelated incidents and should not be assumed to be related without any substantive evidence or context to connect them. For a relationship or logical connection to be established between these two statements, there would need to be a key element within each scenario that ties them together. For example, if there was a storm or extreme weather event causing both the aerobatic plane to struggle in the air and the ship to sink in the ocean, then one could argue that the two statements share a connection. In this case, there still wouldn't be a direct causation between the helicopter-plane event and the sinking ship, but at least the shared factor of severe weather would provide a contextual link. Nonetheless, the original statements given provide no such evidence or information that would lead us to believe there is any logical connection between them. Therefore, it does not logically follow that \\"A ship sinks in the ocean\\" based merely on the situation wherein \\"A helicopter is flying behind a plane that is performing aerobatics.\\""},{"prompt":"Given the question: Chet Blaylock - Chester Merle Chet Blaylock (November 13 1924 – October 23 1996) was a U.S. politician born in Joliet Montana.

The phrase \\"as the old saying goes\\" is often used to introduce a commonly known proverb, maxim, or piece of wisdom that is accepted as true by a majority of people. The purpose of using this phrase is to establish credibility to the statement being made and to convey a sense of time-tested truth. The word \\"true\\" is a term that suggests that something is based on facts, reality, or genuine qualities. It implies that whatever is being referred to has been proven or shown to be correct, reliable, or trustworthy. Considering the given sentence, it appears that the sentiment of the review leans towards being positive. This is because the reviewer, by using \\"the old saying goes\\" and \\"it's true,\\" conveys agreement and acceptance of the message being depicted in the movie. However, it is worth noting that without knowing the actual old saying or the context of the movie being reviewed, it is difficult to provide a fully accurate sentiment analysis.

Please answer the following question: Information: - An engine or motor is a machine designed to convert one form of energy into mechanical energy. Heat engines burn a fuel to create heat, which then creates a force. Electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion; pneumatic motors use compressed air and clockwork motors in wind-up toys use elastic energy. In biological systems, molecular motors, like myosins in muscles, use chemical energy to create forces and eventually motion. - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology. - \\"Tractive Effort\\" is nothing but the force exerted by the engine/motor on the wheels of an automobile. In simpler words,the more the load on an automobile,the more tractive effort required. Tractive effort is the force generated by a vehicle's engine or motor in order to generate motion through tractive force. Tractive effort differs from tractive force, which is the actual force applied at the road surface, by the amount of rolling resistance present. In mathematical terms, Tractive effort = tractive force + rolling resistance - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines. - The Terascale Open-source Resource and QUEue Manager (TORQUE) is a distributed resource manager providing control over batch jobs and distributed compute nodes. TORQUE can integrate with the non-commercial Maui Cluster Scheduler or the commercial Moab Workload Manager to improve overall utilization, scheduling and administration on a cluster. - Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure. Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client. Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries. Construction starts with planning, design, and financing; and continues until the project is built and ready for use. - A vehicle (from ) is a mobile machine that transports people or cargo. Typical vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), aircraft and spacecraft. - A backhoe loader, also called a loader backhoe, digger in layman's terms, or colloquially shortened to backhoe within the industry, is a heavy equipment vehicle that consists of a tractor like unit fitted with a loader-style shovel/bucket on the front and a backhoe on the back. Due to its (relatively) small size and versatility, backhoe loaders are very common in urban engineering and small construction projects (such as building a small house, fixing urban roads, etc.) as well as developing countries. This type of machine is similar to and derived from what is now known as a TLB (Tractor-Loader-Backhoe), which is to say, an agricultural tractor fitted with a front loader and rear backhoe attachment. - Most shovels are hand tools consisting of a broad blade fixed to a medium-length handle. Shovel blades are usually made of sheet steel or hard plastics and are very strong. Shovel handles are usually made of wood (especially specific varieties such as ash or maple) or glass-reinforced plastic (fibreglass). - A tractor is an engineering vehicle specifically designed to deliver a high tractive effort (or torque) at slow speeds, for the purposes of hauling a trailer or machinery used in agriculture or construction. Most commonly, the term is used to describe a farm vehicle that provides the power and traction to mechanize agricultural tasks, especially (and originally) tillage, but nowadays a great variety of tasks. Agricultural implements may be towed behind or mounted on the tractor, and the tractor may also provide a source of power if the implement is mechanised. - Tillage is the agricultural preparation of soil by mechanical agitation of various types, such as digging, stirring, and overturning. Examples of human-powered tilling methods using hand tools include shovelling, picking, mattock work, hoeing, and raking. Examples of draft-animal-powered or mechanized work include ploughing (overturning with moldboards or chiseling with chisel shanks), rototilling, rolling with cultipackers or other rollers, harrowing, and cultivating with cultivator shanks (teeth). Small-scale gardening and farming, for household food production or small business production, tends to use the smaller-scale methods above, whereas medium- to large-scale farming tends to use the larger-scale methods. There is a fluid continuum, however. Any type of gardening or farming, but especially larger-scale commercial types, may also use low-till or no-till methods as well. - A backhoe , also called a rear actor or back actor , is a piece of excavating equipment or digger consisting of a digging bucket on the end of a two - part articulated arm . They are typically mounted on the back of a tractor or front loader , the later forming a ' backhoe loader ' ( colloquially known as a JCB in Ireland and UK ) . The section of the arm closest to the vehicle is known as the boom , and the section which carries the bucket is known as the dipper or dipper - stick ( the terms \`\` boom '' and \`\` dipper '' having been used previously on steam shovels ) . The boom is generally attached to the vehicle through a pivot known as the king - post , which allows the arm to slew left and right , usually through a total of around 180 - 200 degrees . - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the father of the boy who watched his sister learn harpsichord? The Mozart children were not alone as 18th-century music prodigies. Education writer Gary Spruce refers to hundreds of similar cases, and cites that of William Crotch of Norwich who in 1778, at the age of three, was giving organ recitals. British scholar Jane O'Connor explains the 18th century fascination with prodigies as \\"the realisation of the potential entertainment and fiscal value of an individual child who was in some way extraordinary\\". Other childhood contemporaries of Mozart included the violinist and composer Thomas Linley, born the same year as Wolfgang, and the organist prodigy Joseph Siegmund Bachmann. Mozart eventually became recognised among prodigies as the future standard for early success and promise.Of seven children born to Leopold and Anna Maria Mozart, only the fourth, Maria Anna (Nannerl), born 31 July 1751, and the youngest, Wolfgang Amadeus, born 27 January 1756, survived infancy. The children were educated at home, under Leopold's guidance, learning basic skills in reading, writing, drawing and arithmetic, together with some history and geography. Their musical education was aided by exposure to the constant rehearsing and playing of Leopold and his fellow musicians. When Nannerl was seven her father began to teach her to play the harpsichord, with Wolfgang looking on; according to Nannerl's own account \\"the boy immediately showed his extraordinary, God-given talent. He often spent long periods at the clavier, picking out thirds, and his pleasure showed that they sounded good to him... When he was five years old he was composing little pieces which he would play to his father who would write them down\\". A family friend, the poet Johann Andreas Schachtner, recounted that at the age of four Wolfgang began to compose a recognisable piano concerto, and was able to demonstrate a phenomenal sense of pitch.

After arguments about Virginia's trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and a variety of bullfighters and Siegel's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy. On a trip to Nevada to visit a gambling joint, Bugsy comes up with the idea for a hotel and casino in the desert. He obtains 1 million in funding from lifelong friend Lansky and other New York mobsters, reminding them that in Nevada, gambling is legal. Virginia wants no part of it until Bugsy puts her in charge of accounting and begins construction of the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, but the budget soon soars to 6 million due to his extravagance. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets completed, even selling his share of the casino. Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate Harry Greenberg. Harry has betrayed his old associates to save himself. He has also run out of money, from a combination of his gambling habits and being extorted by prosecutors who want his testimony. Though he is Harry's trusted friend, Bugsy has no choice but to kill him. He is arrested for the murder, but the only witness is... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The casino in the movie \\"Bugsy\\" is being built in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Who knows why? But his Mozart symphonies from Vienna are almost lilting, a quality one doesn't associate with this Szell protoge. His Tchaikovsky ballet suites are magnificent in every way, and so are the excrepts from The Bartered Bride on this CD.The orchestra is so ravishing, and the recording captures them so well, that Levine would only need to be half as good. Yet great conductors can outshine themselves, and here he displays joy and brio throughout.

In the fictional town of It Had To Be, Indiana, fullback Blue Grange scores the winning touchdown for It Had To Be University in the 1963 National Championship game. Afterwards, a shunned cheerleader named Bambi is seen fawning over Grange's locker before the on-field celebration pours into the locker room. As a group of cheerleaders are cleaning up the field after the game, all five are skewered with a javelin thrown by an unknown assailant. The bizarre murder makes headlines, as does a subsequent murder involving exploding pompons. As a result, the college's summer cheerleading camp is closed down. In 1982, the camp reopens with Bambi as the instructor. After arriving on campus, she meets Pepe the maintenance man and his mother Salt, both of whom warn her against reopening the camp as they believe it to be cursed with death, but Bambi is undeterred. At a bus station, a young woman named Candy (labeled Victim #1) prepares to board a bus to the cheerleading camp but her religious fanatic mother tries to dissuade her. As they quarrel, red beams of light suddenly streak from Candy's eyes and levitate her mother into the air. As she hangs suspended, Candy tells her that she just wants to be normal and marches away to catch the bus.

Relatives of a dying lady I was caring for kicking and screaming not to give their Mum pain relief because they were so terrified / knew it would probably be the thing to end her life. She had a horrible aggressive cancer that ravaged her whole body and needed very regular doses of strong pain relief which - as she had a terminal illness and was receiving end of life care - did not have an upper limit so to speak. She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing.

Didn’t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn’t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway. One daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom.

Marc Zakharovich Chagall ( sh@-GAHL; born Moishe Zakharovich Shagal; 6 July [O.S. 24 June] 1887 - 28 March 1985) was a Russian-French artist of Belarusian Jewish origin. An early modernist, he was associated with several major artistic styles and created works in virtually every artistic format, including painting, book illustrations, stained glass, stage sets, ceramic, tapestries and fine art prints. Art critic Robert Hughes referred to Chagall as \\"the quintessential Jewish artist of the twentieth century\\" (though Chagall saw his work as \\"not the dream of one people but of all humanity\\"). According to art historian Michael J. Lewis, Chagall was considered to be \\"the last survivor of the first generation of European modernists\\". In Russia at that time, Jewish children were not allowed to attend regular Russian schools or universities. Their movement within the city was also restricted. Chagall therefore received his primary education at the local Jewish religious school, where he studied Hebrew and the Bible. At the age of 13, his mother tried to enroll him in a Russian high school, and he recalled, \\"But in that school, they don't take Jews. Without a moment's hesitation, my courageous mother walks up to a professor.\\" She offered the headmaster 50 roubles to let him attend, which he accepted. A turning point of his artistic life came when he first noticed a fellow student drawing. Baal-Teshuva writes that for the young Chagall, watching someone draw \\"was like a vision, a revelation in black and white\\". Chagall would later say that there was no art of any kind in his family's home and the concept was totally alien to him. When Chagall asked the schoolmate how he learned to draw, his friend replied, \\"Go and find a book in the library, idiot, choose any picture you like, and just copy it\\". He soon began copying images from books and found the experience so rewarding he then decided he wanted to become an artist. He eventually confided to his mother, \\"I want to be a painter\\", although she could not yet understand his sudden interest in art or why he would choose a vocation that \\"seemed so impractical\\", writes Goodman. The young Chagall explained, \\"There's a place in town; if I'm admitted and if I complete the course, I'll come out a regular artist. I'd be so happy!\\" It was 1906, and he had noticed the studio of Yehuda (Yuri) Pen, a realist artist who also operated a small drawing school in Vitebsk, which included the future artists El Lissitzky and Ossip Zadkine. Due to Chagall's youth and lack of income, Pen offered to teach him free of charge. However, after a few months at the school, Chagall realized that academic portrait painting did not suit his desires.","completion":"This text is about Marc Zakharovich Chagall, a Russian-French artist of Belarusian Jewish origin.

Complete agreement finally came about in 1577, after the death of both Melanchthon and Flacius, when a new generation of theologians resolved the doctrinal controversies on the basis of Scripture in the Formula of Concord of 1577. Although they decried the visible division of Christians on earth, orthodox Lutherans avoided ecumenical fellowship with other churches, believing that Christians should not, for example, join together for the Lord's Supper or exchange pastors if they do not completely agree about what the Bible teaches. In the 17th century, Georgius Calixtus began a rebellion against this practice, sparking the Syncretistic Controversy with Abraham Calovius as his main opponent. In the 18th century, there was some ecumenical interest between the Church of Sweden and the Church of England. John Robinson, Bishop of London, planned for a union of the English and Swedish churches in 1718. The plan failed because most Swedish bishops rejected the Calvinism of the Church of England, although Jesper Swedberg and Johannes Gezelius the younger, bishops of Skara, Sweden and Turku, Finland, were in favor. With the encouragement of Swedberg, church fellowship was established between Swedish Lutherans and Anglicans in the Middle Colonies. Over the course of the 1700s and the early 1800s, Swedish Lutherans were absorbed into Anglican churches, with the last original Swedish congregation completing merger into the Episcopal Church in 1846. In the 19th century, Samuel Simon Schmucker attempted to lead the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of the United States toward unification with other American Protestants. His attempt to get the synod to reject the Augsburg Confession in favor of his compromising Definite Platform failed. Instead, it sparked a Neo-Lutheran revival, prompting many to form the General Council, including Charles Porterfield Krauth.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is reduced by playback equipment?\\" Context: \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The reduced element by playback equipment is the amplitude of high and low frequencies. This is done to restore the tonal balance in the original signal and reduce high frequency noise, ultimately allowing more music to fit on the record and improving sound quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Lobelia is a genus of flowering plants, Asplenium is a genus of what? A:","completion":"Asplenium is a genus of ferns, which are non-flowering vascular plants that belong to the family Aspleniaceae. These plants typically reproduce through the release of spores rather than producing flowers or seeds, as is the case with flowering plants like those in the Lobelia genus. Asplenium ferns are known for their distinctive leaf patterns, with leaves that can be simple or highly divided, depending on the species. There are approximately 700 species within the Asplenium genus, and they can be found in a wide range of habitats, including forests, rocky cliffs, and even urban environments. Some common names for Asplenium ferns are \\"spleenwort\\" and \\"bird's nest fern,\\" which refer to specific species within the genus. The Asplenium genus has a vast global distribution, occurring in temperate and tropical regions of the world, although the majority of species are found in tropical areas. Some well-known species of Asplenium ferns include Asplenium scolopendrium (Hart's tongue fern), Asplenium nidus (bird's nest fern), and Asplenium ruta-muraria (wall rue). Given the variety of habitats and climates they inhabit, Asplenium ferns have adapted to various growing conditions, such as low light levels, high humidity, and different types of substrates ranging from soil to rocky surfaces. Asplenium ferns are even known to be epiphytic (growing on other plants), while some species are naturally adapted to growing on rocks or as lithophytes (rock-dwelling plants). In general, Asplenium ferns are valued for their ornamental qualities both in outdoor gardens and as indoor plants. The striking foliage of these ferns makes them popular landscape choices as well as container plants. When grown indoors, Asplenium ferns typically prefer bright, indirect light, and consistent humidity levels to maintain their health and vigor. In conclusion, while Lobelia is a genus of flowering plants, Asplenium is a genus of ferns. These non-flowering vascular plants are diverse and adaptable, found in various environments across the globe. Asplenium ferns are generally sought after for their unique leaf patterns and ornamental qualities, both in outdoor gardens and as popular indoor plants."},{"prompt":"- The recyclable materials go to a recycling center - The recycling center further separates the materials - Large equipment compacts the materials into bales - The recyclable materials are shipped to other recycling centers - The other recycling centers further process the materials that center specializes in - The materials are purchased by manufacturers - The manufacturers process the recycled materials the same way they would use new materials - The recycled materials are incorporated into new products.

But I can use this background: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States.

Uganda: asasinarea lui David Kato Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The phrase you provided, \\"Uganda: asasinarea lui David Kato,\\" is in Romanian. Translated to English, it means, \\"Uganda: the assassination of David Kato.\\" David Kato was a prominent Ugandan LGBT rights activist, often described as Uganda's first openly gay man. He was a key figure in the fight against discrimination and violence towards the LGBT community in Uganda. Born in 1964, Kato spent significant time abroad before returning to Uganda and becoming a teacher. However, his career in education was cut short when he was outed as a gay man. This led him on the path of advocating for LGBT rights, where he rose to prominence both nationally and internationally. The environment for LGBT people in Uganda has long been hostile. Homosexuality is illegal in the country and can carry a sentence of life imprisonment. In addition, there are significant cultural and religious prejudices against homosexuality in Uganda, which have often made the lives of LGBT people particularly difficult and dangerous. David Kato was a vocal critic of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill, proposed in the Ugandan parliament in 2009, which sought to introduce the death penalty for certain homosexual acts. Kato's advocacy against this bill brought him considerable attention and also made him a target for threats and violence. Kato's assassination in 2011 came shortly after a local newspaper published a list of people it claimed were gay. The list included Kato's name and photo, alongside a headline reading \\"Hang Them.\\" Kato was bludgeoned to death in his home, an act which sparked outrage around the world and drew attention to the plight of the LGBT community in Uganda. The aftermath of the assassination was marked by a widespread global outcry, with many international organizations condemning the Ugandan government for its treatment of LGBT individuals. Meanwhile in Uganda, Kato's death led to an upsurge in activism and resistance from the LGBT community. David Kato's legacy as an LGBT rights advocate has continued after his death. He is often seen as a martyr for the cause and his life and death have served as a catalyst for change in Uganda, as well as bringing the plight of LGBT people in the country to international attention. Despite the risks and the challenges, activists in Uganda continue to fight for LGBT rights, inspired by the example of David Kato."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

This incident has left many international organisations and human rights activists worried about the future of the OSCE's efforts in addressing the human rights concerns in the region, especially as the situation in Chechnya has been an ongoing point of contention and strife. The OSCE, a leading intergovernmental organisation promoting peace, human rights, and the rule of law, has been focused on its mission in Grozny since the early 2000s. With the primary goal of monitoring the human rights situation in the aftermath of the Chechen wars, the OSCE has worked tirelessly to document and report on the shocking levels of violence, forced disappearances, persecution of dissenters, and other troubling issues facing the region. As the chief of the mission, the now hospitalised individual had been instrumental in assessing and addressing these human rights concerns, liaising with local and international actors, and spearheading various capacity-building programs. His dedicated work has earned him the respect and admiration of many, both within the OSCE and the broader human rights community. The reason behind his sudden hospitalisation remains undisclosed, and there is no official statement on his current condition or prognosis. However, as the situation unfolds, concerns about the operational continuity and the potential consequences for the ongoing monitoring efforts cannot be ignored. In the wake of this hospitalisation, it is crucial to address the challenges that the OSCE mission in Grozny will likely have to overcome. First and foremost, the mission will need to find an interim replacement to carry out the essential functions of the chief until a permanent solution is found. This transition period may prove to be challenging, given the intricate and delicate balance of political and societal factors that have shaped the fragile situation in Chechnya. Moreover, the mission faces the ongoing threat of intimidation, harassment, and hostility from certain elements within the Chechen Republic. The OSCE mission's efforts to document human rights abuses have often been met with resistance, sometimes even placing the lives of its members at risk. As such, it is imperative that the mission's security remains a top priority in light of the recent events. Moving forward, the international community and the OSCE must ensure that their vital work in Grozny continues uninterrupted. While it is still unclear how the absence of the mission chief will impact the OSCE's efforts, it is a timely reminder of the challenges faced by those who work tirelessly to uphold human rights in volatile situations. In conclusion, the hospitalisation of the OSCE's Grozny mission chief presents a critical situation for the organisation's work in Chechnya. As efforts to put the region's human rights back on track continue, it is vital that the OSCE mission finds the necessary support to adapt to new challenges and maintain its vital role in monitoring the ongoing conflict. The international community must stay alert and engaged with the situation in Chechnya, as the stakes are too high to let human rights violations go unchecked."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After dinner one night, Meryl and Paul witness the murder of one of Meryl's real estate clients. As a result, they become targets of contract killer Vincent (Michael Kelly) and must enter the Witness Protection Program. Paul and Meryl are relocated to the small town of Ray, Wyoming and placed temporarily under the protection of husband and wife/sheriff and deputy, Clay and Emma Wheeler (Sam Elliot and Mary Steenburgen). For their own safety, they are permitted no outside contact via telephone or e-mail. They have trouble adjusting to small-town life, but after a perilous encounter with a bear and awkward attempts at shooting rifles, chopping wood, and horseback riding, they eventually adjust and begin assisting the local citizens professionally. Meanwhile, neither of their assistants back in New York know their whereabouts. Vincent plants a bug at Meryl's office and in her assistant Jackie's purse, hoping to gain information, which is eventually successful. Jackie attempts to call Meryl but Paul's assistant Adam stops her by kissing her, which she responds to by tasering him. Paul and Meryl go on a \\"date\\" in town and begin to reconcile, but then Paul is hurt when he learns that Meryl had a one-night stand with one of their acquaintances during their separation. The next day, with Vincent in town unbeknownst to them, the Morgans anticipate leaving Ray for a permanent hiding place. The Wheelers invite them to a rodeo, but the Morgans are at loggerheads, so they decline. Leaving the Morgans without any form of security, the Wheelers leave for the rodeo.

Unlike the bumbling Ustinov, Suchet gets the suave sophistication and incisive intellect of the great detective exactly right. This is a great DVD set for all Agatha Christie fans. Answer: A:","completion":"The tone of the product review appears to be predominantly positive. Here's a deeper look at why this is the case: 1. The statement \\"If there was ever a man born to play Poirot, it is David Suchet\\" is undeniably positive. The use of \\"ever\\" and \\"born to play\\" creates an impression of approval and shows the author believes the actor has done an extraordinary job portraying the character of Poirot. 2. The comparison to the other actor, Ustinov, who is referred to as \\"bumbling\\", may initially seem negative, but is primarily used to even further elevate the performance of David Suchet. Thus, it serves a positive purpose. 3. Describing Suchet's handling of Poirot's character as 'getting the suave sophistication and incisive intellect of the great detective exactly right', is high praise indeed. Labelling the detective as 'great' also indicates a positive sentiment towards the character and shows the reviewer's apparent love for this character. 4. The final portion of the review, \\"this is a great DVD set for all Agatha Christie fans\\", is another clear positive endorsement for the product in question. The reviewer outright states that this DVD set is \\"great\\" and universally recommends it to all fans of Agatha Christie. This implies that the reviewer has faith that other fans of Christie will likely enjoy this DVD set as much as they have, which again emphasizes the positive tone. Therefore, the overall tone of the product review is positive due to its use of praising terms and phrases, admiration for the actor, and a strong recommendation for any fan of Agatha Christie's works. It expresses a high level of satisfaction with the DVD set and the actor's performance in particular."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Her marriage to Ferdinand II of Aragon became the basis for the political unification of Spain under their grandson, Charles I. After a struggle to claim her right to the throne, she reorganized the governmental system, brought the crime rate to the lowest it had been in years, and unburdened the kingdom of the enormous debt her brother had left behind. Context: At the end of the Reconquista, only Granada was left for Isabella and Ferdinand to conquer. The Emirate of Granada had been held by the Muslim Nasrid dynasty since the mid-13th century. Protected by natural barriers and fortified towns, it had withstood the long process of the reconquista. On 1 February 1482, the king and queen reached Medina del Campo and this is generally considered the beginning of the war for Granada. While Isabella's and Ferdinand's involvement in the war was apparent from the start, Granada's leadership was divided and never able to present a united front. It still took ten years to conquer Granada, however, culminating in 1492. The Spanish monarchs recruited soldiers from many European countries and improved their artillery with the latest and best cannons. Systematically, they proceeded to take the kingdom piece by piece. In 1485 they laid siege to Ronda, which surrendered after only a fortnight due to extensive bombardment. The following year, Loja was taken, and again Muhammad XII was captured and released. One year later, with the fall of Malaga, the western part of the Muslim Nasrid kingdom had fallen into Spanish hands. The eastern province succumbed after the fall of Baza in 1489. The siege of Granada began in the spring of 1491 and at the end of the year, Muhammad XII surrendered. On 2 January 1492 Isabella and Ferdinand entered Granada to receive the keys of the city, and the principal mosque was reconsecrated as a church. The Treaty of Granada was signed later that year, and in it Ferdinand and Isabella gave their word to allow the Muslims and Jews of Granada to live in peace. An uprising by the Moors in 1500 caused the Catholic side to consider that the Moors had violated the Treaty: this gave them a justification for revoking its provisions. See Morisco Revolt. During the war, Isabella noted the abilities and energy of Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba and made him one of the two commissioners for the negotiations. Under her patronage, De Cordoba went on to an extraordinary military career that revolutionised the organisation and tactics of the emerging Spanish military, changing the nature of warfare and altering the European balance of power. Question: did they do anything else to improve their army. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Isabella and Ferdinand did more things to improve their army. They made it stronger and better by recruiting soldiers from different European countries, which brought new skills and ideas to their army. They also updated their weapons, especially the cannons, which made them more powerful. By noticing talented people like Gonzalo Fernandez de Cordoba and giving them important roles, they were able to make their army smarter and more strategic. All of these things together helped Isabella and Ferdinand make their army better and stronger, which helped them win the war and conquer Granada."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be?","completion":"In the comic strip \\"Andy Capp,\\" created by Reg Smythe, the main character Andy Capp is a lazy, unemployed man who loves to drink and often spends his time at his favorite pub. The pub has been a consistent setting throughout the comic strip's history. The favorite pub of Andy Capp is typically portrayed as a British working-class pub, and it has had various landlords throughout the comic strip's long run. It is essential to understand that comic strips often evolve and change over time in terms of characters and premises. Thus, the pub's landlord may have varied from one point in the series to another. However, the character who has run Andy Capp's favorite pub more frequently is Jack. Jack the bartender is a friendly and understanding character who often chats with Andy and sometimes offers him advice. He has been present in the pub since the earlier issues of the comic strip and has become one of the most recognizable supporting characters alongside Flo (Andy's wife), Chalkie White (Andy's best friend), and sometimes other regular pub patrons like Percy the bookie. As the original question does not provide any options to choose from, it is safe to say that Jack is the character who runs Andy Capp's favorite pub out of all the potential options. Jack's presence and interaction with Andy serve to highlight the main character's frequent indulgence in alcohol, his unemployment issues, and his witty banter. This portrays a consistent character dynamic and setting throughout the comic strip's long-lasting publication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Assessing the situation: The protagonist will first assess the situation to determine the level of distress the person is experiencing. This may include observing their swimming abilities, physical condition, emotional state, and potential dangers such as strong currents, jellyfish, or sharks, among other factors. 2. Providing assistance: Based on the assessment, the protagonist may provide necessary assistance, which could include helping the person stay afloat using flotation devices or their own body as a support. They may also offer verbal reassurances to help calm the person down, as panic can be a significant factor in aquatic emergencies. 3. Signaling for help: If the situation warrants it, the protagonist may choose to signal for help from lifeguards, nearby swimmers, or other rescue personnel in the vicinity. This could involve shouting, waving, using a whistle, or employing other signaling methods to attract attention. 4. Performing a rescue: In the event that the person is unable to swim back to shore independently or with minimal assistance, the protagonist may need to perform a water rescue. This could involve approaching the person from behind to avoid potential aggression, securing a firm hold on the individual, and cautiously swimming back to shore or to a nearby flotation device. 5. Administering first aid: Once safely on shore, the protagonist may need to administer basic first aid or CPR if the person has experienced any injuries or near-drowning incidents. In more severe cases, they may need to call emergency services for professional medical assistance. 6. Debriefing and follow-up: After the rescue, the protagonist may discuss the incident with the person, their guardians, and any other relevant parties, offering advice on how to avoid similar situations in the future. They might also share their experience with lifeguards or other safety personnel to help improve beach safety precautions. In summary, upon reaching the person in trouble, the protagonist will likely assess the situation, provide necessary assistance, possibly perform a rescue, and administer first aid if needed.

The exact time of the liftoff varies from source to source and is mentioned as 05:30:42 Moscow Time or 07:22 Moscow Time.At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate. The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's nose cone was jettisoned successfully; however the \\"Block A\\" core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the thermal insulation tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to 40 °C (104 °F). After three hours of weightlessness, Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min, three times longer than it had taken during earlier ground tests, an indication of the stress she was under. The early telemetry indicated that Laika was agitated but eating her food. After approximately five to seven hours into the flight, no further signs of life were received from the spacecraft.The Soviet scientists had planned to euthanise Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from asphyxia, when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanised. Many rumours circulated about the exact manner of her death. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth orbit. In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in Houston, Texas, \\"It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.\\"Over five months later, after 2,570 orbits, Sputnik 2—including Laika's remains—disintegrated during re-entry on 14 April 1958.","completion":"Dimitri Malashenkov submitted a paper explaining how Laika died in the city of Houston, Texas."},{"prompt":"Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS. Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - Storytelling is the social and cultural activity of sharing stories, often with improvisation, theatrics, or embellishment. Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story. - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\" - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques. - Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was an Irish playwright, novelist, essayist, and poet. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He is remembered for his epigrams, his novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death. - The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde, first published complete in the July 1890 issue of \\"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\\". The magazine's editor feared the story was indecent, and without Wilde's knowledge, deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year. - \`\` The Canterville Ghost '' is a short story by Oscar Wilde , widely adapted for the screen and stage . It was the first of Wilde 's stories to be published . The story is about a family who moves to a castle haunted by the ghost of a dead nobleman , who killed his wife and was starved to death by his wife 's brothers . - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story. - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph. - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. What object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'the canterville ghost'? Choices: - account - activity - category - censorship - classification - concrete - culture - death - degree - embedding - fiction - five - genre - history - hundred - idea - incident - invention - july - literature - magazine - mode - monthly magazine - mood - narrative - novel - novella - october - person - play - prose - public - publication - sentence - sharing - short story - synonym - term - variety - video - work - year","completion":"The object entity that has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'The Canterville Ghost' is 'short story'.

Question: A thicker wire will give more or less resistance? Text: The thinner the wire, the more resistance it offers. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given text, a thicker wire will give less resistance. This is because the text states that \\"the thinner the wire, the more resistance it offers.\\" As the thickness of the wire increases, its ability to resist the flow of electrons (which causes electrical resistance) decreases. This results in a more efficient electrical current flow through the wire and a reduced amount of energy being converted to heat or other unwanted forms. There are several reasons why a thicker wire is able to provide less resistance. One of the primary factors is the cross-sectional area of the wire, which directly impacts its capacity to conduct electricity. A thicker wire has a larger cross-sectional area, which allows for a greater number of electrons to be transmitted simultaneously. This results in less opposition to the flow of current and, thus, less resistance. Another factor to consider is the presence of impurities or defects in the wire's material. Thinner wires have a higher likelihood of containing impurities or defects, which can impede the flow of electrons and cause increased resistance. Thicker wires, on the other hand, are less likely to experience this issue due to their greater overall material volume. Furthermore, a thicker wire may also result in a lower operating temperature as compared to a thinner wire. This is because a thicker wire can dissipate heat more effectively, preventing temperatures from rising to levels that would increase the resistance of the wire. In summary, a thicker wire will give less resistance as compared to a thinner wire. This is due to factors like the increased cross-sectional area for the flow of electrons, lower likelihood of impurities or defects in the material, and better heat dissipation capabilities. Consequently, thicker wires are often preferred for electrical applications where low resistance and efficient energy transfer are paramount, such as in power transmission lines and high-performance electronic devices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It indicates that there might be some exceptions or limitations to the considered matter. Sentence 2: \\"Not even the slightest bit.\\" This sentence represents a clear negation, implying that something is not true or there is a complete absence of truth in a particular matter. There is no uncertainty or room for other interpretations, which contrasts with the hesitance or openness of the first statement. Now, let's consider the question: \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" Since the first sentence is vague and does not provide any specific context, we cannot definitively determine the truth value of the second sentence based on the first sentence alone. If the first sentence were conveying that there is some level of truth to an idea or statement, then it would be conceivable that the second sentence, which completely denies any truth, may be false in relation to the same idea or statement. However, without concrete information about the subject matter of these sentences, it is impossible to declare the second sentence as true or false.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Sediment becomes loose from the rest of the soil - The sediment rolls down hill towards a river - The heavy items sink to the bottom - The lighter items float on the top and in convection cycles - As the river flows the sediment is moved - The sediment gets dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean - The sediment keeps moving around the world in convection currents. Question: suppose the entire planet has heated up happens, how will it affect LESS sediment being transported. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less To better understand how the entire planet heating up would result in less sediment being transported, let's first analyze the process of sediment transportation and the factors that affect it: 1. Weathering and erosion: The process of sediment transportation begins with the weathering and erosion of rocks and soil. This is primarily influenced by factors such as precipitation, temperature fluctuations, wind, and biological processes. Increased temperatures can lead to an acceleration in chemical weathering processes and potentially induce more intense precipitation events. 2. Sediment Availability: As the weathering and erosion processes dislodge sediment particles, they become available for transportation by gravity, wind, and water. The availability of sediment to be transported depends on the rate at which it is weathered and eroded, and on the stability of the landscape, which may be affected by land-use changes, vegetation coverage, and other human-induced changes. 3. Sediment Transport Agents: Water, wind, and ice act as primary sediment transport agents. The ability of these agents to transport sediment depends on their velocity, discharge, and sediment-carrying capacity. Planet-wide heating may result in the melting of ice, which reduces the capacity for sediment transportation by ice. Additionally, increased temperatures can increase evapotranspiration rates, which could reduce the amount of water available for transporting sediment. Now, let's consider how the entire planet heating up would affect the various stages of sediment transportation and ultimately result in less sediment being transported: 1. Accelerated weathering and erosion: While higher temperatures can increase the rate of chemical weathering, they can also lead to reduced vegetation cover and less organic material in the soil, which can, in turn, make the soil more susceptible to erosion. This may result in a short-term increase in sediment availability, but over time, the reduced vegetation cover will likely lead to the depletion of sediment for transport, ultimately contributing to less sediment being moved. 2. Reduced water availability: With higher global temperatures comes increased evapotranspiration rates and potential changes in precipitation patterns. This can lead to significantly lower water levels in rivers, reducing their ability to carry sediment. Additionally, less ice means less sediment transport by glaciers, further contributing to the overall reduction in sediment transportation. 3. Decreased sediment-carrying capacity: As water levels drop, the velocity of rivers may also decrease, reducing their sediment-carrying capacity and making it more difficult for them to transport sediment effectively. This results in the sediment being more likely to settle and remain in place, rather than being transported to other locations. In conclusion, the entire planet heating up would likely result in less sediment being transported within the earth's systems. This is primarily due to reduced water availability for sediment transport, as well as the potential depletion of sediment through accelerated weathering and erosion processes, which may be insufficiently replenished due to reduced vegetation cover and other impacts of climate change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Although someone who behaves in selfish ways may be frustrating to be around, it is possible that selfish behavior may indicate that the person is dealing with deeper issues, such as depression or narcissistic personality disorder. Try to avoid judging or labeling your friend as selfish and self-centered. Instead, try to find out what is going on in your friend’s life that may be causing him or her to behave in selfish ways. For example, you might say, “You seem wrapped up in the negative things that have been happening in your life. What's going on?” Encourage your friend to seek help if they're depressed or dealing with other serious issues. Advise your friend to talk to a school counselor or a therapist. What does your friend do that irritates you? Does she say negative things to you, constantly demand your attention, or talk only about herself without stopping? Get a good handle on exactly what it is that bothers you about your friend. Some friends ask for help but never give anything in return. In this case, they're taking more from the relationship than they're giving, leaving it one-sided. Others talk themselves all the time but never ask how you are. If you do talk, they seem uninterested. This is another example of a one-sided relationship. Another type of selfishness is attention seeking. They may constantly call you and try to get you to hang out. They don't respect your need for alone-time. The underlying problems of selfishness may give you a little something to go on when talking to the person. You may also be able to develop a little more empathy for your friend if you consider why he or she may be acting in selfish ways. Selfish or self-centered people may be insecure or have a negative self image. As such, they look for attention or try to get others to think about them. Consider their childhood. Maybe they expect attention because that's what they're used to. Maybe they're desperate for attention because they never got any growing up. Selfishness is a normal human behavior and we are all guilty of it sometimes. Think about times that you’ve been selfish to get some perspective. You may have been selfish unintentionally and hurt others' feelings. For example: Have you ever interrupted someone during a conversation? Have you ever gotten bored when someone else was talking and started thinking about a problem of your own? Did you ever insist someone to spend time with you, even though you knew that they weren't feeling well? What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses the possibility that selfish behavior in a friend could be a sign of deeper issues like depression or narcissistic personality disorder.

What is the correct answer to this question?","completion":"The question given is asking for an example of the formation of a mixture. To provide the correct answer to this question, let's first understand what a mixture is and its different types. A mixture, in the context of chemistry and materials science, refers to a substance consisting of two or more components combined without undergoing any chemical reaction, which means their original properties are preserved. Mixtures also have variable compositions, meaning that the proportion of their components can be altered without causing any change in their identity. There are two primary types of mixtures: homogeneous mixtures and heterogeneous mixtures. 1. Homogeneous mixtures: These mixtures have a uniform composition and appearance. Their components are evenly distributed at the particle level, leaving no distinct separate phases. Examples of homogeneous mixtures include solutions, such as salt dissolved in water and air. 2. Heterogeneous mixtures: These mixtures consist of components with different properties that are not distributed uniformly throughout the mixture. They often have visible separate layers or phases, where the different components can be easily distinguished. Examples of heterogeneous mixtures include oil and water, sand mixed with water, and a bowl of fruit salad. Now that we understand mixtures and their types, let's provide an example of the formation of a mixture: An example of the formation of a mixture can be observed when making a cup of tea. When we mix hot water and tea leaves (or a teabag) in a cup, the end product is a mixture. In this case, a homogeneous mixture is formed, as the flavor, color, and smell of the tea leaves are evenly distributed throughout the hot water. The original properties of the tea leaves and the water are preserved—each component retains its chemical identity, and no new compound is formed during the process. The composition of the mixture can also be altered, for example, by adding more tea or more water without affecting the nature of the mixture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Recently a specialist in teenager studies does some research on teenage problems. He thinks parents shouldn't be blamed of themselves because there is nothing they can do to deal with the teenage problem. Whatever they do, sometimes a wonderful, kind and helpful child will turn into a terrible animal. I've seen friends deal with _ in all kinds of different ways. One strict mother insisted that her son, should stand up, open doors and shake hands like a gentleman whenever anyone entered the room. I saw him last week when I visited them. Lying on the sofa, he made no attempt to turn off the loud TV he was watching as I walked in. His mother was angry. \\"I don't know what to do with him these days,\\" she said. \\"He's forgotten all the manners we taught him.\\" He hasn't forgotten them. He's just decided that he's not going to use them. She said that she would like to throw him down from the sofa onto the floor. Another good friend of mine let her two daughters climb all over the furniture, reach across the table, stare at me and say, \\"I don't like your dress, it's ugly.\\" One of the daughters has recently been driven out of school. The other has left home. \\"Where did we go wrong?\\" Her parents are now very sad. Probably nothing is wrong with the parents. Question: What is the author's opinion about the sudden change in teenage children? Options: A: Parents have no choice but to try to accept it. B: Parents should pay more attention to the change. C: Parents should work more closely with school teachers. D: Parents are a fault for the change in their children. Answer:","completion":"The author's opinion about the sudden change in teenage children is most closely aligned with Option A: Parents have no choice but to try to accept it. Based on the article, the author presents various situations where despite the parents' best efforts, the teenagers in question have still exhibited a stark behavioral transformation. The author mentions that even though these parents tried different modes of upbringing from strict discipline to lenient allowances, they still faced the disappointment and challenge of their child's unexpected change. The author pointed out situations such as where a mother insisted on her son behaving like a gentleman, and who nonetheless later ignored these manners, to the example of a mother who was laid back allowing her daughters to violate social norms only to find they later faced serious issues like being expelled from school and leaving home. Despite these diverse and perhaps extreme efforts from parents, the author has sectioned the outcomes under the umbrella of 'teenage problem', empathizing with the parents in each circumstance by stressing that there is nothing they can do about it. Therefore, this indicates the inevitability of the difficult teenage phase, and the author seems to suggest that the best course for parents is to accept these changes and manage their expectations accordingly. However, it's essential to note that the author's perspective does not diminish the significance of parents' role, but rather emphasizes the unpredictable nature of teenage behavior and the limit of parental control. It then reinforces the notion, expressed in the article, that parents should not blame themselves for these sudden changes in their children during adolescence.

It aims to help with achieving a greater understanding of the behavior of children through an understanding of their minds. It deals with children who range from the prenatal stage right up to the stage of adolescence. The psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) has been credited with making a major breakthrough in this area when he put forward his idea that children were not actually less intelligent than adults, rather they just thought in a different way. Preciously the development of children right from birth through to adulthood was an area that was almost completely _ . In fact very little work was done in this area. However, interest in this field has now developed to the point of being one of the most debated of all the areas of psychology. Despite popular belief that factors such as genetics or personal characteristics are the only determining factors that influence a youth's behavior, this is not in fact the case. In reality, development actually includes many more factors than those contained within an individual. Factors such as environment, which can include social relationships and the surrounding culture, also play important roles. Relationships with both peers and adults will no doubt affect how children think and learn, and therefore develop. These relationships can include those that are found not only within families but also in schools and peer groups. Culturally speaking, this factor will contribute greatly to how children develop their personality concerning the values they end up holding (perhaps for a lifetime) as well as how they view such things as traditions and customs. Nowadays, psychologists have agreed that a child's psychology is both unique and highly complex. However, there are debates on many different points in this field and many viewpoints exist.

A. tuna B. eaten C. rooster D. cow E. chopped The best answer is The answer is:","completion":"C. rooster To provide a detailed explanation, let's first consider the nature of chickens and their egg-laying behavior. Chickens are domesticated fowl, primarily raised for their meat, eggs and sometimes for their feathers. The primary egg-laying species in the context of this question are hens, which are female chickens. Hens will lay eggs regardless of whether a rooster, the male counterpart, is present or not. However, it is important to understand the role of roosters in the egg-laying process. In the absence of a rooster, hens will still lay eggs, but they will be infertile - meaning they cannot develop into a chick. If the goal of the amateur is to simply collect eggs for consumption, the presence of a rooster might not be essential. However, it should be noted that the presence of a rooster can sometimes encourage more consistent laying behavior from the hens. Roosters, on the other hand, serve several functions within a flock. Their primary purpose is to fertilize the eggs laid by hens, leading to the development of fertilized eggs, which can eventually grow into chicks. In the presence of a rooster, the possibility of a hen's eggs developing into offspring greatly increases. Additionally, roosters have a protective role within the flock, keeping an eye out for potential threats and defending the hens if necessary. They also help to maintain the social order within the flock and can assist in finding food for the group. Considering the alternatives mentioned in the question: A. Tuna - There is no relevance or connection between tuna, a type of saltwater fish, and a chicken's egg-laying capacity. B. Eaten - This option does not fit into the context of the question. D. Cow - Cows are bovines raised for their milk, meat, and leather, which have no direct influence on chicken egg-laying behavior. E. Chopped - The term \\"chopped\\" in this context has no relevance or association with the egg-laying ability of a chicken. In conclusion, the best answer to this question, given the options provided, is C. rooster. Although the presence of a rooster does not directly impact the quantity of eggs a hen will lay, it does play a role in the fertilization of eggs and overall flock dynamics, which, in turn, could indirectly influence egg-laying. Should the amateur in the question be looking to increase the production of fertilized eggs and maintain a healthy flock dynamic, introducing a rooster would be beneficial."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who implores Achilles for possession of Hector's body? Movie plot title: Troy Movie plot: The story takes place in the fertile, eastern lands bordered by the Mediterranean Sea and kept by the gods. Within the cradle of ancient civilization empires are built, wars fought, alliances forged, and heroes born.Agamemnon (Brian Cox), king of Mycenae, has united most of Greece's kingdoms under his rule and now advances his army upon the nation of Thessaly, hoping to include it in his collection of ever-growing conquests. King Triopas (Julian Glover) bargains with Agamemnon to each let one of their best fighters decide who wins the battle rather than engaging in open war. Triopas calls upon the giant Boagrius (Nathan Jones) while Agamemnon calls to Achilles, but the legendary warrior is nowhere to be found. A messenger boy (Jacob Smith) is sent to fetch him and Agamemnon curses the stubborn nature of the fiercest warrior Greece has ever seen. A half-god and blessed with incomparable strength and skill, Achilles lives to fight but he refuses to associate with Agamemnon, preferring instead to seek his own destiny and be immortalized in history. Achilles easily defeats Boagrius, sealing Agamemnon's control over the nation, and calls out if there is anyone else worthy enough to fight him.Meanwhile, Prince Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy feast in the banquet hall of King Menelaus of Sparta (Brendan Gleeson) as honored guests and peace ambassadors to their home nation. However, young Paris sneaks away to be with Menelaus' beautiful wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), whom he loves dearly. He convinces her to come back with him to Troy, stowing her away on his brother's ship. When Hector finds out he is clearly angry but it is too late to return to Sparta with Helen and seek pardon. Finding Helen gone, Menelaus vows revenge on Troy and seeks the approval of his brother, Agamemnon, who is only too happy to oblige, though Agamemnon's decision comes mostly from his desire to sack Troy.Odysseus (Sean Bean), king of Ithaca and under command of Agamemnon, goes to convince Achilles to accompany them in the...

Paragraph: Mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV 3) is either avirulent (resistant mice), hepatotropic (susceptible mice), or neurotropic (semisusceptible mice), depending on the strain of mice infected. In semisusceptible mice, infection led first to a transient meningitis, ependymitis, and leukoencephalitis, followed by a permanent communicating hydrocephalus and, later on, to a chronic thrombotic vasculitis affecting meningeal and parenchymal vessels at the brain stem level. Small foci of ischemic necrosis related to vascular occlusions were seen in the dorsal brain stem. Cyclophosphamide treatment of semisusceptible mice significantly reduced the meningeal infiltrates but did not prevent the development of hydrocephalus and other neuropathologic changes. Identical lesions occurred in fully susceptible mice infected with a low dose of virus, but no neurologic disorder could be induced in genetically resistant mice even following immunosuppression or intracranial inoculation. The leukoencephalitis differed from the demyelinating lesions observed with MHV 4. Vascular lesions were of particular interest. More attention should be given to the possibility of virus induced chronic cerebral vasculitis in man.

Answer the following question: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court.

The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany. When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill – the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the early 1930s.The extent to which Bush's music changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\\". In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and masterful use of counterpoint.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians. - The clade Sauria was traditionally a suborder for lizards which originally ( before 1800 ) comprised crocodilians too . It has been redefined as the group containing the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and lepidosaurs and all its descendants ; as such it was commonly thought that Sauria is a crowned - base grouping of diapsids . However , recent genomic studies and comprehensive studies in the fossil record suggest that turtles are closely related to archosaurs , not to parareptiles as previously thought . As such Sauria can be seen as a crowned - group of all modern reptiles ( including birds ) within the larger total group Sauropsida , which also contains various stem - reptile groups . - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone. - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals. - Sauropsida (\\"lizard faces\\") is a group of amniotes that includes all existing birds and reptiles as well as their fossil ancestors and other extinct relatives. Large land animals are either in this group or in its sister group, Synapsida, which includes mammals and their fossil relatives. This clade includes Parareptilia and other extinct clades. All living sauropsids are members of the sub-group Diapsida, the Parareptilia clade having died out 200 million years ago. The term originated in 1864 with Thomas Henry Huxley, who grouped birds with reptiles based on fossil evidence. - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included). - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians. - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Parareptilia (\\"at the side of reptiles\\") is a subclass or clade of reptiles which is variously defined as an extinct group of primitive anapsids, or a more cladistically correct alternative to Anapsida. Whether the term is valid depends on the phylogenetic position of turtles, the relationships of which to other reptilian groups are still uncertain. - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses. - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - Synapsids (Greek, 'fused arch'), synonymous with theropsids (Greek, 'beast-face'), are a group of animals that includes mammals and every animal more closely related to mammals than to other living amniotes. They are easily separated from other amniotes by having a temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for their name. Primitive synapsids are usually called pelycosaurs or pelycosaur-grade synapsids; more advanced mammal-like ones, therapsids. The non-mammalian members are described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics; they can also be called stem mammals or proto-mammals. Synapsids evolved from basal amniotes and are one of the two major groups of the later amniotes; the other is the sauropsids, a group that includes modern reptiles and birds. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed in the ancestral synapsid about 312 million years ago, during the Late Carboniferous period.

Barbaro accused him of using inflamatory words to ''set off the races.'' The Mayor, in turn, said that Mr. Barbaro favored a quota system of awarding New York City jobs. ''Now Frank believes in quotas,'' he said, adding with a little laugh: ''He just doesn't like the word.'' Mr. Koch and Mr. Barbaro, one of the Mayor's opponents in the Democratic primary on Sept. 10, sat in shirtsleeves, occasionally glowering at each other across the third candidate, Melvin Klenetsky, who was a taut barrier between them in a dark blue suit. From Jokes to Gibes The radio debate on station WKCR, in a cramped and stuffy studio on the Columbia University campus, began with heavy jocularity but turned testy when Mr. Barbaro accused the Mayor of worsening racial tensions. ''I'm not a doctor and I don't have a bedside manner,'' Mr. Koch said, when asked about the Citizens Union comment in its endorsement of him that his outspoken manner could be polarizing. ''It's my nature,'' Mr. Koch said, ''and I'll try to curb it.'' Mr. Barbaro persisted. ''There you go again, Eddie,'' he said after Mr. Koch had accused him of planning to use quotas - by sex, race and so forth - to staff the city government. ''You set off the magic words.'' In the final minute of the one-hour presentation, Mr. Barbaro put his half spectacles down on the circular table, leaned into the microphone and said that Mr. Koch was projecting a ''subliminal message'' and that ''everybody knows what that means.'' Asked for clarification after the show, Mr. Barbaro replied: ''I am telling you that the message to the white middle class was that he was going to put the minorities in their place.'' That, he said as he scooped his notes off the table, is why Mr. Koch is ''so popular.'' Koch Calls Rival 'Desperate' Mr. Koch had plucked his suit jacket off a hook and hurried out to another appointment by the time the charge was explained, but asked about it later, he said that late in campaigns ''desperate'' candidates ''seek to throw mud and invective.'' The radio debate, only the second of the campaign, started with a 15-minute exchange between Mr. Koch and Assemblyman John A. Esposito, opponents in the Republican primary. Mr. Esposito reiterated his charge that Mr. Koch, a Democrat, was ''creeping into our Republican family,'' and Mr. Koch laughed good-humoredly and said: ''I'm running as a Democrat. I haven't in any way concealed that.'' Then it was the turn of the three Democrats, with Mr. Klenetsky directed to the center seat. ''So he becomes a centrist?'' Mr. Koch asked. ''I don't know what he is, Ed,'' Mr. Barbaro replied. Three years ago Mr. Klenetsky ran as the U.S. Labor Party candidate for Governor of Illinois, and Mr. Koch and Mr. Barbaro did not pay much attention to him yesterday as he reiterated his belief that a policy of ''planned shrinkage'' threatened to turn New York into ''another Hong Kong.'' Finances vs. Services Mr. Koch said that New York was ''in terrible shape'' financially when he moved into City Hall and that he had restored fiscal stability. Mr. Barbaro said city services ''were never worse.'' Their argument sharpened when Mr. Barbaro said Mr. Koch had ''failed the city transit system'' and had stood at the Brooklyn Bridge ''as a strikebreaker'' during last year's subway and bus strike. The Mayor rolled his eyes in a show of impatience. ''It's hard to catch up with all these ridiculous statements,'' he said. ''But I'll try.'' Far from being a ''strikebreaker,'' he said animatedly, he had been ''keeping the city going,'' telling New Yorkers: ''Come on over. Don't let that union bring us to our knees.'' In contrast with the mayoral candidates and their handful of debates, the candidates for the Democratic nomination for Comptroller have been in broadcast studios almost daily.

Barbaro, who are opponents in the Democratic primary on September 10, takes place in a cramped and stuffy studio at the Columbia University campus. Melvin Klenetsky is the third candidate present as a barrier between Koch and Barbaro. 2. Barbaro accuses Mayor Koch of using inflammatory words to worsen racial tensions and says that Koch sends a \\"subliminal message\\" to the white middle class to put minorities in their place, contributing to his popularity. Mayor Koch later dismissed these accusations, attributing them to \\"desperate\\" candidates trying to throw mud and invective towards the end of a campaign. 3. The debate also covers the candidates' respective stances on city transit systems, fiscal stability, and city services. 4. Mayor Koch defends his role during the subway and bus strike, stating that he was trying to keep the city going and encourage New Yorkers not to let the union bring them to their knees. 5.

I know that the answer to the question \\"__ allows lending with interest.\\" is in \\"Presbyterians distinguish themselves from other denominations by doctrine, institutional organization (or \\"church order\\") and worship; often using a \\"Book of Order\\" to regulate common practice and order. The origins of the Presbyterian churches are in Calvinism. Many branches of Presbyterianism are remnants of previous splits from larger groups. Some of the splits have been due to doctrinal controversy, while some have been caused by disagreement concerning the degree to which those ordained to church office should be required to agree with the Westminster Confession of Faith, which historically serves as an important confessional document – second only to the Bible, yet directing particularities in the standardization and translation of the Bible – in Presbyterian churches.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Usury. In the context provided, Presbyterians allow lending with interest, also known as usury. This practice differentiates them from some other religious denominations which may prohibit or heavily restrict usury due to doctrinal or ethical reasons. While the given passage does not explicitly mention usury, it can be inferred based on the historical context of Calvinism and the Westminster Confession of Faith, which serve as influential foundational elements for the Presbyterian Church. The origins of the Presbyterian churches lie in Calvinism, a major branch of Protestantism founded by John Calvin in the 16th century. Calvin, unlike some other religious leaders of his time, saw lending with interest as a permissible practice as long as it was maintained within reasonable bounds. He believed that the practice could contribute to the common good and promote economic growth, provided that it was not exploitative. This view was later incorporated into the principles of Presbyterianism, setting it apart from some other Christian denominations. Additionally, the Westminster Confession of Faith, an important confessional document for the Presbyterian churches, supports the practice of usury, as long as it is guided by justice and fairness. The confession sets forth principles for ethical lending and borrowing, emphasizing the importance of honest dealings and assistance to those in need. Thus, within the confines of the Westminster Confession of Faith and the broader context of Calvinism, Presbyterianism allows lending with interest, setting it apart from certain other religious traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At home, the atmosphere is strained between Kym and her family members as they struggle to reconcile themselves with her past and present. Kym's father Paul (Bill Irwin) shows intense concern for her well-being and whereabouts, which Kym interprets as mistrust. Kym also resents her sister's choice of her best friend to be her maid of honor instead of her. Rachel, for her part, resents the attention her sister's drug addiction is drawing away from her wedding, a resentment that comes to a head at the rehearsal dinner, where Kym, amid toasts from friends and family, takes the microphone to offer an apology for her past actions, as part of her twelve-step program.

Answer the following question: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set... Question: what are the factors that make one a refugee === The answer to the above question is pick from the following. a). a foreigner; b). not enough information; c). persecuted person; d). person outside his country of nationality due to security reasons; Answer:","completion":"d). person outside his country of nationality due to security reasons; A refugee, as defined by the 1951 United Nation's Refugee Convention, is someone who is outside their country of nationality due to security reasons and fear. This fear needs to be well-founded and due to being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. This person is unable or, due to this fear of persecution, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of their home country. Therefore, a refugee is someone who by necessity has had to leave the country where they held nationality and seek refuge elsewhere. The factors making one a refugee, then, are largely bound up within this definition. The main factors include: 1. Well-Founded Fear of Persecution: The fear of persecution is often attributable to one's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. This can force people to flee their home countries to preserve their lives and freedom. 2. Being Outside Their Country of Nationality: A person must be outside the country of their nationality while fearing persecution. A person who is still inside their country under the conditions of oppression or persecution would, under international law, be more accurately described as an internally displaced person. 3. Inability or Unwillingness to Avail Their Country's Protection: If a person's home country can protect them and they can safely live there without fearing persecution, then they cannot be classified as a refugee. A potential refugee must be unable - or unwilling due to the well-founded fear - to accept the protection of their home country. 4. The Need for International Protection: Refugees typically cannot return to their home country due to the danger and, as such, require international protection as they are at risk of human rights abuses. The displacement of individuals to refugee status is typically an involuntary decision made out of necessity, driven by severe threats to personal wellbeing and safety. It is essential to remember that these factors interplay with many complex individual and societal aspects such as political instability, war, violence, and humanitarian crises."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Usually I hate overly convoluted mysteries (like this) but I LOVE this movie. It moves very quickly (only 72 minutes), is beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz (he uses tons of camera tricks that just speed the narrative along), has a very ingenious story line (including a solution to a locked room murder that was just incredible) and has a very good cast. Powell is very suave and great as Vance--he doesn't seem to be acting--he IS Vance! Mary Astor isn't given much to do but she adds class and beauty to the production. Everybody else is very good too, but best of all is Eugene Pallette as Detective Heath. He's a very good actor with a VERY distinctive voice and some of his lines were hilarious. Basically, an excellent 1930s Hollywood murder mystery. Well worth seeing. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of the review is highly positive.

Ramis had a Jewish upbringing. In his adult life, he did not practice any religion. He graduated from Stephen K. Hayt Elementary School in June 1958 and Nicholas Senn High School in 1962, both Chicago public schools, and in 1966 from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was a member of the Alpha Xi chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Ramis began writing parodic plays in college, saying years later, \\"In my heart, I felt I was a combination of Groucho and Harpo Marx, of Groucho using his wit as a weapon against the upper classes, and of Harpo's antic charm and the fact that he was oddly sexy--he grabs women, pulls their skirts off, and gets away with it\\". He avoided the Vietnam War military draft by taking methamphetamine to fail his draft physical. Following his work in St. Louis, Ramis returned to Chicago, where by 1968, he was a substitute teacher at schools serving the inner-city Robert Taylor Homes. He also became associated with the guerrilla television collective TVTV, headed by his college friend Michael Shamberg, and wrote freelance for the Chicago Daily News. \\"Michael Shamberg, right out of college, had started freelancing for newspapers and got on as a stringer for a local paper, and I thought, 'Well, if Michael can do that, I can do that.'

Aidan McSweeney, 18, sustained multiple injuries when he fell from the rooftop in the suspected accident. A teenager climbed scaffolding while high on meow meow and plunged to his death, an inquest heard. Aidan McSweeney, 18, sustained multiple injuries when he fell from the rooftop after taking drug mephedrone. The clever teenager had recently moved out of the family village home in Towcester, Northamptonshire, after his A-levels to live with friends in town. His distraught mother Lynne Bucinikas, 54, described her son as a ‘sensitive’ boy who became a victim of peer pressure. Away from home he lived in an environment where drugs like mephedrone were readily available which he took to ‘fit in’. Lynne, who runs a landscape gardening business, yesterday sent a stark warning to other parents. She said: ‘I think it's appalling that so many youngsters died before it was made illegal. Even now you can find it and other manufactured drugs like it online. ‘It's become socially acceptable to take at parties and I want parents to realise how freely available these drugs are to young people. ‘My son was a sensitive and intelligent boy but he wanted to fit in, you wouldn't realise the danger if everyone is doing it. ‘He moved out to live with his friends. We live in a quiet village so it allowed him to go out, I was happy for him to enjoy himself. ‘I think he took the drugs to feel accepted by his peers, he always wanted to be the entertainer at parties. ‘Before he died we heard that he had not slept for three days on this drug. We were told that other times he woke up in unfamiliar places with no idea how he got there.’ Aidan moved out of his family home in Towcester, which he shared with his mother and sister Catlin, 17, to a flat in Northampton. Grieving family: Lynne Bucinkas and her 17 year old daughter Caitlyn from Paulerspury, near Northampton, say Aidan became the victim of peer pressure. He had finished his A-Levels and was deciding whether to take a year out or accept his place at Coventry University to read politics. Aidan died in hospital just eight hours after he plunged to the pavement near his flat at 2.25am, on July 19, last year. He had climbed up onto scaffolding and fell from the roof in what Lynne believes was a drug-fuelled prank. Traces of mephedrone, which was made illegal just three months earlier in April 2010, were found in his system. The heartbroken mother spoke out after a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death at his inquest at Northampton Coroners Court. Lynne blasted a young man who was known to hold drug fuelled parties at the time of her son’s death and was later convicted of dealing. She said: ‘We know that Aidan was seen going to this dealers house about four hours before he died but he denied selling Aidan drugs. ‘He was the same age as Aidan and held parties for youngsters where drugs were available. ‘He made so much money from selling to impressionable kids. He avoided police detection because he wasn't your typical drug dealer. ‘He was geeky looking, from an affluent family and drove a nice car. ‘Aidan saw this dealer as a friend but he was just an evil predator who got kids hooked on drugs. ‘We know Aidan took mephedrone before his death and I am convinced that if he hadn't he would be here now.’ Write highlights for this article.","completion":"An 18-year-old boy named Aidan McSweeney climbed up some tall construction stuff called scaffolding and sadly fell.

(CNN) -- BP showed up in court last week, finally, nearly three years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster and the hell it unleashed on the Gulf Coast. It's a huge, high-stakes trial, and BP is taking the beating it's earned. Here's what's at stake for America if there is a judgment: potentially tens of billions of dollars that will be used to create jobs while restoring some of our most productive and vulnerable natural places. Whether the trial results in a decision or a settlement, the outcome will send a signal about how serious this country is about enforcing its common-sense rules that guarantee clean air and waters. BP and its partners have already confessed to criminal negligence in the 2010 blowout that killed 11 men and gushed nearly 5 million barrels of oil. Every part of the Gulf of Mexico ecosystem, from the deep-sea corals to dolphins to migratory birds, was affected. Gulf Coast residents suffered billions of dollars in economic losses, with effects that rippled across the country. And despite those slick commercials that assure you all is well and then invite you to spend your tourism dollars on the Gulf Coast, the disaster is still unfolding. Last summer, scientists found traces of BP's oil and dispersant in the eggs of migratory white pelicans nesting all the way up in Minnesota. Oil is still present on the Gulf's beaches, in the marshes and under the water. It is working its way through the food chain, so it will be years before we understand the full extent of the disaster. BP's billions at stake as courtroom showdown starts Just Wednesday, in fact, the Gulf Restoration Network documented a fresh rash of tarballs on a Louisiana beach known as Elmer's Island -- a spot that gets re-oiled every time a storm stirs up BP's submerged goo. We're nearly three years in, and there's no end in sight. Become a fan of CNNOpinion Stay up to date on the latest opinion, analysis and conversations through social media. Join us at . We welcome your ideas and comments. That's why our justice system must hold BP and other polluters fully responsible under the law for the worst offshore oil disaster in history. How much could BP end up paying? BP is liable for up to 17.6 billion in penalties under the Clean Water Act if it is found grossly negligent. (And if this isn't gross negligence, it's hard to imagine what is.) Add to that figure the potential for tens of billions more in fines under the Oil Pollution Act. This much is clear: The rules were put in place to deter and, if needed, to penalize the offenders. The Deepwater Horizon was the kind of disaster that was envisioned when the full force of these penalties was contemplated. Those penalties -- and nothing short -- are the fair outcome. It wasn't surprising to see BP's stock rise when it agreed to an unprecedented 4.5 billion in criminal fines. The market was saying, in essence: Guys, it could have been a lot worse. BP claims it now leads the way on safety So we know that some amount of penalties -- a staggering amount by normal standards -- has already been \\"priced in\\" to BP's value. So, this isn't about whether BP will continue to be an ATM for shareholders. It will be. And we're not saying that there shouldn't be drilling in the Gulf Coast. We're saying that even megacorporations need to play by the rules. If Justice Department lawyers agree to a weak settlement, the burden of rebuilding from this disaster will be transferred from a foreign corporation to American taxpayers. Worse, it will send a message to polluters that we don't take seriously our air, water, wildlife, communities or economic health. What's the difference between a 15 billion settlement and a 35 billion dollar judgment? The ability to rebuild the Louisiana wetlands -- America's delta-- for generations to come. A healthy, productive Gulf Coast where people and wildlife thrive. The principle that if you break it, you buy it. Families of killed rig workers react to BP settlement Under the terms of the RESTORE Act -- passed last year with historic bipartisan support -- 80% of Clean Water Act civil penalties will go back to restore the environment and economies of the Gulf Coast states. That's right and fair. We don't love how the states want to spend every dollar. But this is what a grand political bargain looks like, in case we've forgotten. Two weeks ago, we and our partners hand-delivered more than 133,000 petitions to the Department of Justice, calling for full and complete accountability under the law for BP and its partners. The point of the petitions was pretty straightforward: These rules matter to Americans, and everyone needs to play and -- in this case -- pay fully. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Yarnold. Summary:","completion":"A long time ago, there was a big accident where a company called BP spilled lots of oil into the ocean. This caused lots of problems for animals, plants, and people who live near the ocean. Now, BP is in court which means that they are being judged on whether they need to pay a lot of money for fixing the problems they caused. This money could help create jobs and restore the natural places that were hurt by the oil spill. It's important that this company is held responsible, so they and others are more careful in the future to prevent accidents like this from happening again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The major symptoms of a penile yeast infection are as follows: Soreness and irritation: A man with a penile yeast infection will experience a reddish-colored rash on the head of the penis. There may be an itching and burning sensation on the tip of the penis, which can be very irritating. When passing urine, the burning sensation may be more intense. Discharge: A man with a penile yeast infection may notice a white substance coming from the penis, similar to the discharge from a vaginal infection. The discharge may have an unpleasant odor. Discomfort during intercourse: A man with a penile yeast infection may experience discomfort during sexual intercourse, due to the soreness, irritation, and inflammation of the penis. The most common causes and risk factors for penile yeast infection include: Sexual transmission: Just like sexually transmitted infections, a yeast infection can be transmitted through sexual contact. A man can contract penile yeast infection by having unprotected intercourse with a yeast-infected woman. Antibiotics: Although it is less common than sexual transmission, a man can get penile yeast infection through prolonged use of antibiotics. Diabetes: Yeast thrives well in glucose, therefore men with diabetes are more susceptible to yeast infections, due to their elevated blood sugars. Foods: A typical American diet increases the chances of a man developing penile yeast infection. Wheat, barley, oats, peanuts, red apples, and corn encourage yeast growth in the body because of their high glucose content, which is food for yeast. Nonoxynol-9: This is a sperm-killing drug contained in condom lubricants. This substance has been linked to causing yeast infections in men. If you suspect that you have a penile yeast infection, it's important that you see your doctor instead of trying to diagnose and treat yourself. Even though many home remedies and over-the-counter medications exist, your doctor can determine the best option for your specific health needs and rule out the possibility of another condition with similar symptoms, such as some STIs. If treated improperly, a penile yeast infection can lead to complications like scarring, swollen glands, and painful urination. Yeast infections can also enter the bloodstream if the infection has time to spread. What is a summary?","completion":"A penile yeast infection is characterized by symptoms such as a reddish rash on the penis head, itching and burning sensations, discharge, and discomfort during intercourse.

Fully stain five of the boards for the red stripes but only partially stained the remaining seven boards This will give the effect of a striped american flag. 2). Prep the table by sanding it with 220 sandpaper.","completion":"Option 2, prep the table by sanding it with 220 sandpaper, is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning for creating the American flag pattern on the table. Let me explain the reasoning step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the American flag pattern The American flag consists of 13 horizontal stripes (7 red stripes and 6 white stripes), and a blue canton with 50 white stars on it. Step 2: Option 1 analysis Fully staining five boards for the red stripes and only partially staining the remaining seven boards would not create the correct pattern. Firstly, there would be an inconsistency in the color of the stripes, with the unstained parts appearing more like an off-white. Secondly, this option does not address the blue canton with the white stars. Step 3: Option 2 analysis Prepping the table by sanding it with 220 sandpaper is a more appropriate starting point. Sanding helps create a smooth and uniform surface for paint or stain to adhere to and ensures better results when applying the American flag pattern. So following the reasoning, right after option 2, here's how to proceed further with the American flag pattern on the table: Step 4: Measure and mark the stripes Measure and mark the placement of the 13 stripes on the table so that they are evenly spaced, and there will be 7 red stripes and 6 white stripes. Step 5: Measure and mark the blue canton Measure and mark the area where the blue canton will be positioned (top-left corner). Step 6: Paint the table Paint the stripes in the appropriate colors (red and white) and paint the marked area for the blue canton. Allow the paint to dry. Step 7: Add the stars Place a stencil or stickers with stars arranged according to the alignment on the American flag over the blue canton and paint or apply the 50 white stars. Allow the paint to dry. Step 8: Seal the surface Apply a clear coat or sealant to protect the painted American flag pattern on the table. So, based on the naive physics reasoning, option 2 followed by the above steps would be a more sound approach to creating the American flag pattern on the table."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Hieronymus Bosch (born Jheronimus van Aken ; 1450 9 August 1516) was a Dutch/Netherlandish draughtsman and painter from Brabant. He is widely considered one of the most notable representatives of Early Netherlandish painting school. His work is known for its fantastic imagery, detailed landscapes, and illustrations of religious concepts and narratives. Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of hell. - Sir Peter Paul Rubens (28 June 1577 30 May 1640) was a Flemish/Netherlandish draughtsman and painter. He is widely considered as the most notable artist of Flemish Baroque art school. A proponent of an extravagant Baroque style that emphasized movement, colour, and sensuality, Rubens is well known for his Counter-Reformation altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and history paintings of mythological and allegorical subjects. - The Prado Museum is the main Spanish national art museum, located in central Madrid. It features one of the world's finest collections of European art, dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and unquestionably the best single collection of Spanish art. Founded as a museum of paintings and sculpture in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. El Prado is one of the most visited sites in the world, and is considered one of the greatest museums of art in the world. The numerous works by Francisco de Goya, the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by Diego Velázquez, El Greco, Titian, Peter Paul Rubens and Hieronymus Bosch are some of the highlights of the collection. - Tiziano Vecelli or Tiziano Vecellio (1488/1490 27 August 1576), known in English as Titian , was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto, Republic of Venice). During his lifetime he was often called \\"da Cadore\\", taken from the place of his birth. - Doménikos Theotokópoulos (; 1541 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco, was a painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" (\\"The Greek\\") was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, (\\"Doménikos Theotokópoulos\\"), often adding the word (\\"Krs\\", \\"Cretan\\"). - The Dog is the name usually given to a painting by Spanish artist Francisco Goya , now in the Museo del Prado , Madrid . It shows the head of a small black dog gazing upwards . The dog itself is almost lost in the vastness of the rest of the image , which is empty except for a dark sloping area near the bottom of the picture : an unidentifiable mass which conceals the animal 's body . The Dog is one of the Black Paintings Goya painted directly onto the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823 .

Grace Beverly Jones (born 19 May 1948) is a Jamaican singer, songwriter, supermodel, record producer, and actress. Born in Jamaica, she moved when she was 13, along with her siblings, to live with her parents in Syracuse, New York. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features. Grace Jones was born in 1948 (though most sources say 1952) in Spanish Town, Jamaica, the daughter of Marjorie (nee Williams) and Robert W. Jones, who was a local politician and Apostolic clergyman. The couple already had two children, and would go on to have four more. Robert and Marjorie moved to the East Coast of the United States, where Robert worked as an agricultural labourer until a spiritual experience during a failed suicide attempt inspired him to become a Pentecostal minister. While they were in the US, they left their children with Marjorie's mother and her new husband, Peart. Jones knew him as \\"Mas P\\" ('Master P') and later noted that she \\"absolutely hated him\\"; as a strict disciplinarian he regularly beat the children in his care, representing what Jones described as \\"serious abuse\\". She was raised into the family's Pentecostal faith, having to take part in prayer meetings and Bible readings every night. She initially attended the Pentecostal All Saints School, before being sent to a nearby public school. As a child, shy Jones had only one schoolfriend and was teased by classmates for her \\"skinny frame\\", but she excelled at sports and found solace in the nature of Jamaica. Marjorie and Robert eventually brought their children - including the 13 year old Grace - to live with them in the US, where they had settled in Lyncourt, Salina, New York, near Syracuse. It was in the city that her father had established his own ministry, the Apostolic Church of Jesus Christ, in 1956. Jones continued her schooling and after she graduated, enrolled at Onondaga Community College majoring in Spanish. Jones began to rebel against her parents and their religion; she began wearing makeup, drinking alcohol, and visiting gay clubs with her brother. At college, she also took a theatre class, with her drama teacher convincing her to join him on a summer stock tour in Philadelphia. Arriving in the city, she decided to stay there, immersing herself in the Counterculture of the 1960s by living in hippie communes, earning money as a go-go dancer, and using LSD and other drugs. She later praised the use of LSD as \\"a very important part of my emotional growth... The mental exercise was good for me\\". She moved back to New York at 18 and signed on as a model with Wilhelmina Modelling agency. She moved to Paris in 1970. The Parisian fashion scene was receptive to Jones' unusual, androgynous, bold, dark-skinned appearance. Yves St. Laurent, Claude Montana, and Kenzo Takada hired her for runway modelling, and she appeared on the covers of Elle, Vogue, and Stern working with Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer. Jones also modelled for Azzedine Alaia, and was frequently photographed promoting his line. While modelling in Paris, she shared an apartment with Jerry Hall and Jessica Lange. Hall and Jones frequented Le Sept, one of Paris's most popular gay clubs of the 1970s and '80s, and socialised with Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld. In 1973, Jones appeared on the cover of a reissue of Billy Paul's 1970 album Ebony Woman.","completion":"This text is about Grace Beverly Jones, a Jamaican singer, songwriter, supermodel, record producer, and actress."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: To think for a long time you need to be able to?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Don't be scared: Australia stocks still a buy Australia's stock market suffered a dismal second quarter, posting its biggest quarterly loss since the third quarter of 2011, but that hasn't scared off analysts. For the first six months of 2015, the benchmark S&P ASX 200 index advanced just 0.9 percent after a massive sell-off in May and June erased nearly all of the gains from earlier in the year. In the June quarter, the resource-heavy index fell 7.34 percent, wiping off 162 billion worth of market capitalization – its biggest quarterly loss in 16 quarters – according to data from Credit Suisse. By comparison, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 5.78 percent in the first half of the year, breaching the 20,000 mark for the first time since 2000, while South Korea's Kospi index climbed 1.91 percent over the same period. Meanwhile, China's Shanghai Composite is up around 14 percent, despite a steep and rapid correction which took the benchmark index down to bear market territory last month. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 5.19 percent over the first two quarters of 2015. Despite the underperformance, analysts aren't writing off Australian equities just yet. Credit Suisse, for one, remains constructive on shares down under. But analysts at the Swiss bank lowered their near-term target for the S&P ASX 200 index to 6,000, from 6,500, according to a note earlier this week. Apart from expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will keep cutting interest rates, an unusually low cost of debt and further growth in free cash-flow (FCF) will underpin the country's share market, the report said. Read MoreAustralia's RBA Governor Stevens says rate cuts on table, butsees risks While the measure of the cost of debt has risen since the end of March from 3 percent to 3.5 percent, it is offset by a high free cash-flow yield which signifies an \\"unusually attractive arbitrage opportunity between debt and equities,\\" said Credit Suisse analysts, who are expecting the S&P ASX 200 ex-Financials free-cash-flow yield to reach 5 percent by June-2016. \\"An arbitrage opportunity of this magnitude should result in more buybacks and also more debt financed deals, limiting net equity issuance. In turn, the combination of little equity issuance and still strong equity demand, supported by the local pension system and the global-search-for-yield, should be a positive one for stock indices,\\" the note said. Meanwhile, the stock market down under offers better returns than the shrinking yields in the debt market, given that the trailing dividend yield is currently 4.4 percent and 30 basis points higher than the long-term average. \\"International investors on the global search-for-yield should continue to make their pilgrimage to Australia.

Summarize: It was only the second time in the award's history that a children's book had won - and it was over a decade since Philip Pullman scooped the prize for The Amber Spyglass. But change could be afoot as, only last month, The Fox and the Star - an illustrated fable about a fox and his friend - beat the competition to be named Waterstones Book of the Year. Hardinge, delivering the winner's speech she had not thought she needed to prepare, urged more people to explore the \\"beautiful jungle\\" of children's and young adult (YA) fiction, whatever their age. Has the genre finally stepped out of the shadows to stand side-by-side with adult fiction? We asked authors and industry experts for their views: I think there has been a general sea change - and we're definitely seeing it now, a move away from considering children's literature to be a little bit more lightweight. I'd have been happy to see the Costa Book of the Year go to any children's book - but I'm very happy it's mine. The cross-over market is now much more established than it was. Many adults feel less self-conscious to be seen reading, enjoying and appreciating it. There has been interesting and complex children's and young adult fiction for quite some time, but in terms of the consumer landscape and people's attitudes, I think Harry Potter had a lot to do with it. There has been a tendency to make assumptions about the books, to deem them as simplistic. But now, people are seeing their complexity. The idea of the 'beautiful jungle' sprung to mind because it's a place of excitement, danger, beauty - and the unexpected. We have published seven books by her and to now get properly recognised in this way, because Costa is one of the largest awards, feels amazing. I think Frances does share some things with Philip Pullman, in that what she writes appeals to children and appeals to adults. They are adult books, but the main character happens to be a child of 14. You get adults and children picking up the books. I hope that Frances will reach a much broader audience. Children's books do tend to get less mainstream coverage than adult books, so when something like this happens, it's incredibly important. We really need to help parents, teachers and children themselves to have access to quality literature and find out about it. So anything that engages them, inspires them and gets them to read is really important. The wider world is realising what people within children's publishing have known for a while - which is that the quality and output is getting better, year on year. I don't think we're necessarily going to see children's and young adult books winning more adult book prizes, but in terms of people recognising the quality of children's literature, that will happen more often and people will pay more attention to children and young adult book prizes - there are so many of them. As CS Lewis said, 'A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest' - and I think that's definitely the case. For far too long, people have had this idea in their heads that children's and teenagers' literature was somehow inferior. But the children's market has grown more quickly than the adult book market and hasn't been affected by the digital drive. Hopefully, we will see more and more people recognising the quality of a really great children's book. YA fiction has been dismissed as 'issue lit', but The Lie Tree shows it can be incredibly varied and very diverse. It can be very difficult for children's books to go up against adult books, but The Lie Tree has a wider appeal beyond younger readers. In the UK in particular, we have such a rich heritage of children's books, going all the way back to Alice in Wonderland - there is such a rich seam, and some of the very best books are actually for children. Now, in terms of writing and production, children's publishers have really stepped up to the plate. The Fox and the Star was about the quality and the beautiful design, while the Lie Tree is really about the storytelling and richness. But I honestly don't know if I think it's going to be less rare for them to win such awards. I have definitely noticed within the industry there's a lot more respect for children's publishing and children's book selling as a crucial part of the market. Children's books are selling so well, that people have been paying more attention.\\" I feel that a story is a story, regardless of age, and this is something that has been recognised this year by the Costa awards, which is fantastic. I don't think it's the case it makes the genre more credible, it's just that other parts of the book publishing industry are realising that there is an inventiveness, enjoyment and profundity in these books which appeals to readers. The books have to stand up to being read many times, and have layers of meaning, and it's something that the industry now realises. There was such a big gap between the last children's book winning Costa book of the year and now, so we can only hope there will now be more. And to have two awards for children in a short space of time is great.\\" I think Frances' prize is such a brilliant thing for young adult fiction. For me, YA has been the biggest success story of the publishing industry over the past 25 years. Publishers were aware because of the sales figures, and young readers were aware, but it never got the critical attention it merited. This [Costa award] has forced people to sit up and take notice of how great this fiction is. There's been a traditional view in certain quarters that writing for children or teenagers is easier than writing for adults. Having done both, I can say it isn't. There can also be a view it isn't 'proper' literature, but anyone who reads it would be surprised at just how good the books are - they aren't inferior in literary terms. But it takes a long time for these attitudes to disappear. I hope if enough of these books come to the public's attention, it will gradually erode this misconceived ideas. It could be another 15 years before another children's book wins the Costa award - but it's a step in the right direction and will lead to more awareness. Summary:","completion":"A children's book winning the prestigious Costa Book of the Year award has sparked a discussion among authors and industry experts about the growing appreciation and recognition of children's and young adult (YA) fiction. Experts suggest that the success of YA fiction is partially due to the Harry Potter series, which made people more aware of the richness and complexity found in children's literature. The children's book market has grown and evolved, with publishers increasing the quality of writing and production. Authors and industry professionals hope that this newfound respect for children's literature will lead to continued recognition and appreciation of the genre."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(-11*q - 98*q) = -56*q can be rewritten as: -11q - 98q + 56q = 0 Step 2: Calculate the sum of the coefficients of q on the left side of the equation. (-11q + 56q) - 98q = 0 (45q) - 98q = 0 Step 3: Combine the remaining coefficients on the left side of the equation. 45q - 98q = -53q -53q = 0 Step 4: Solve the equation for q. To get the value of q, we need to isolate the variable (q) on one side of the equation. Since we have -53q = 0, we can do this step by dividing both sides of the equation by -53. -53q / -53 = 0 / -53 q = 0 So, the solution to the equation -11*q - 98*q = -56*q is q = 0.

Movie title: Cyrano de Bergerac Context: In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose. Le Bret suggests they go out to eat, but Cyrano says he has no money left, as all he had was in the bag he threw at the theater manager -- a costly...

The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer. Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes. In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway). For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike. The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off. If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be a maximum volume. If the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified. This allows the individual strike risk to be limited. This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving. In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable. Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: How might a person go somewhere? Here are possible answers to this question: - stumbling down - die - might fly - might drive car - get somewhere I believe the correct choice is \\"might drive car\\", here's why: A:","completion":"To answer the question: \\"How might a person go somewhere?\\", I will analyze each of the given possible answers step-by-step and provide justification for my choice. 1. Stumbling down: This option refers to a person physically stumbling or tripping as they move. While this could potentially be a way to move from one place to another, it suggests a lack of control over one's movement and is not likely an efficient or safe way to travel. This would not be a recommended method for going somewhere. 2. Die: This option is not a valid method of moving from one place to another. Dying is the cessation of all biological functions and is, therefore, not an appropriate answer to the question. 3. Might fly: Flying is a feasible method of travel for humans, especially when using airplanes or other aircraft. However, flying is usually employed for long distances or when time is a constraint. While this is a valid choice, it may not apply to all situations or distances. 4. Might drive car: Driving a car is a common, practical, and efficient means of transportation. Most people use cars to travel from one place to another, especially for medium distances or when they need the flexibility to move at their own pace. This option is not only feasible but also widely accessible and practical for a majority of individuals. 5. Get somewhere: This option is too vague and does not provide any specific information on how a person might go from one place to another. Based on the analysis of each possible answer, I agree that the correct choice is \\"might drive car\\". Driving a car is a common and practical way for a person to go somewhere, as it offers a reliable and efficient means of transportation that is suitable for a wide range of distances and situations."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Choices: - north america - europe - asia - south america A: The answer to this question is:","completion":"South America. The Galápagos Islands, also known as the Archipiélago de Colón in Spanish, are an archipelago of volcanic islands that are spread around the Equator. They are located in the Pacific Ocean, around 600 miles (965 kilometers) off the west coast of the continent of South America. In total, there are 18 main islands, 3 smaller islands, and 107 islets and rocks, although only 16 of the main islands are considered significant. These islands are a part of the Republic of Ecuador, which is a South American country. Geographically, Ecuador is situated in the northwestern part of the continent, sharing its borders with Colombia to the north, Peru to the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. The Galápagos Islands are a province of Ecuador, having been annexed by the country in 1832. The Galápagos Islands are globally renowned for their remarkable biodiversity, as well as their unique and fearless wildlife, which has inspired many scientific studies. In fact, these islands played a critical role in the development of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Darwin visited the Galápagos Islands in 1835 during his voyage on the HMS Beagle, and his observations of the various species inhabiting the islands led him to formulate his groundbreaking ideas on natural selection and evolution. The archipelago consists of volcanic islands that vary in age, with the eastern islands being older and the western ones being relatively younger. The Galápagos Islands lie on a volcanic hotspot, and as a result, they continue to experience volcanic activity. The three most recent eruptions were observed on Isabela Island's Wolf Volcano in 2020, Cerro Azul Volcano in 2018, and Sierra Negra Volcano in 2018. Due to their unique ecological significance, the Galápagos Islands were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1978. Additionally, the Galápagos National Park, which covers 97% of the land area of the islands, and the Galápagos Marine Reserve were established to protect and conserve the native flora, fauna, and habitats of this extraordinary region. In conclusion, the Galápagos Islands are a group of volcanic islands located in the Pacific Ocean, 600 miles off the west coast of South America. They are an essential part of the Republic of Ecuador and are celebrated for their incredible biodiversity and crucial role in the development of evolutionary theory. This outstanding environment has earned them the status of a UNESCO World Heritage site, and they continue to be a source of inspiration and fascination for scientists, nature enthusiasts, and tourists alike."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The attack was alleged to have happened in the remote Irotatheri community, close to the border with Brazil.

There were said to be three survivors. On Monday, Survival International said this account did not appear to be correct. \\"Having received its own testimony from confidential sources, Survival now believes there was no attack by miners on the Yanomami community of Irotatheri,\\" said a statement from Stephen Corry, Survival International's director. Yanomami in the area, where many illegal gold miners are operating, had heard stories of a killing in July and this was reported, by some, as having happened in Irotatheri, Mr Corry said. \\"We currently do not known whether or not these stories were sparked by a violent incident, which is the most likely explanation, but tension remains high in the area.\\" The Venezuelan government said teams sent to investigate the reports had found no evidence of an attack. Indigenous rights campaigners said the Venezuelan officials might have failed to find the community in question, which is based in a remote jungle location.

At the age of four, I started speech lessons because even I could not speak well enough to be understood. First grade was a struggle. I not only had difficulty speaking, but I was expected to learn to read and I just couldn't do it. My parents grew more and more frustrated. They bought books and offered great rewards if I could read one of them from start to finish to them. Well, with my speech problems and now my reading problems, I did not like to do reading and so refused to do it whenever possible. Second grade was not much better. It was in the second grade that the teacher decided that I needed special education. I remember the days of taking the physical exams. However, after all that, they decided that I did not qualify for special education. It was in third grade that a new school was built close to where I lived. I remember going there with my parents and helping to get the school ready so that we could transfer . It was a happy day that we started school at Vandalia. However, things did not get better as my parent expected. It was now time for fifth grade. Mrs. Wakefield was my teacher, and if ever there was a teacher that deserved a gold star, it was her. She did not make me feel upset. Instead, she helped me in so many ways and built my self-confidence so that I actually did believe that I could do something special. And that is just what I did. For the past 22 years, I have been a fifth grade teacher. Because of Mrs. Wakefield's influence in my life, I am now encouraging students who have had difficulties in their lives to believe that they can overcome and become someone. I have won a large number of awards but I know that all of them belong to one fifth grade teacher who believed in me and challenged me to be all that I could be. I still have a class picture of her with her fifth grade class hanging on the wall of my office, encouraging other teachers to reach out to their students.

Happiness means everything.","completion":"No, the word \\"mean\\" in these two sentences does not have the same meaning. In the English language, a word can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In these two sentences, \\"mean\\" is being used in two different contexts and thus has different meanings. Let's break down each sentence to understand the meaning of \\"mean\\" better. 1. \\"You never understand what I mean!\\" In this sentence, \\"mean\\" is used as a verb. It is the present tense of the verb 'to mean'. Here, \\"mean\\" refers to the act of conveying or expressing a particular idea, thought, or message. When someone says this, they imply that their intended message or the point they want to make is not being understood by the listener(s). The person who says this sentence believes they have a clear idea or message to convey, but the listener does not seem to grasp the intended meaning. 2. \\"Happiness means everything.\\" In this sentence, \\"mean\\" is again used as a verb; however, its meaning is slightly different from the first sentence. Here, \\"mean\\" refers to the act of representing, signifying, or having a particular value or importance. In this context, happiness is said to be highly valuable or the most important thing for the speaker. It signifies that the person who says this sentence believes that happiness is of utmost importance, and it is the chief goal or purpose in life. In conclusion, the first sentence uses \\"mean\\" to convey the sense of expressing an idea, which gets misinterpreted or misunderstood by the listener, while the second sentence uses \\"mean\\" to signify the importance or value of happiness in one's life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Distillation is an effective method to separate mixtures comprised of two or more pure liquids. Distillation is a purification process in which the components of a liquid mixture are vaporized (transformed from liquid to gas) and then condensed (transformed from gas back to liquid) and isolated. In a simple distillation, a mixture is gradually heated. The solution with the lowest boiling point will change into a gas first. This gas, or vapor, then passes through a cooled tube (a condenser) where it condenses back into its liquid state. This condensed liquid is called the distillate. Figure below illustrates this. Q: Distillation is an effective method to separate mixtures comprised of two or more what? A: Answer:","completion":"Pure liquids.

Following the Protestant Reformation, promoted by local reformer Martin Bucer, the principle of cuius regio, eius religio led to a certain amount of religious diversity in the highlands of northern Alsace. Landowners, who as \\"local lords\\" had the right to decide which religion was allowed on their land, were eager to entice populations from the more attractive lowlands to settle and develop their property. Many accepted without discrimination Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews and Anabaptists. Multiconfessional villages appeared, particularly in the region of Alsace bossue. Alsace became one of the French regions boasting a thriving Jewish community, and the only region with a noticeable Anabaptist population. The schism of the Amish under the lead of Jacob Amman from the Mennonites occurred in 1693 in Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines. The strongly Catholic Louis XIV tried in vain to drive them from Alsace. When Napoleon imposed military conscription without religious exception, most emigrated to the American continent.

These groups included: 1. Catholics: Despite the influence of the Protestant Reformation, Catholicism continued to be practiced and accepted in parts of Alsace. 2. Lutherans: As followers of Martin Luther's teachings, Lutheranism was one of the key branches of Protestantism that gained acceptance in the region. 3. Calvinists: Also known as Reformed Christians, Calvinists were followers of John Calvin's teachings and another significant branch of Protestantism that found acceptance in Alsace. 4. Jews: Alsace became a thriving region for the Jewish community, who were welcomed and allowed to practice their religion freely. 5. Anabaptists: They were a radical Christian movement originating from the 16th-century Reformation, advocating adult baptism and a separation of church and state. Alsace became home to a noticeable Anabaptist population. Within the Anabaptist community, two distinct groups emerged in Alsace: a) Mennonites: Followers of the teachings of Menno Simons, a Dutch Anabaptist leader, who emphasized non-violence and a simple life. b) Amish: A schism within the Anabaptist community led by Jacob Amman gave rise to the Amish, who were more conservative and maintained stricter discipline and separation from the modern world.

Question: \\"What position did Harshavardhana hold?\\" Context: \\"The history of the area that now constitutes Himachal Pradesh dates back to the time when the Indus valley civilisation flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE. Tribes such as the Koilis, Halis, Dagis, Dhaugris, Dasa, Khasas, Kinnars, and Kirats inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. During the Vedic period, several small republics known as \\"Janapada\\" existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajput principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 10th century. Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles. Several hill states acknowledged Mughal suzerainty and paid regular tribute to the Mughals.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"King Harshavardhana, who is mentioned in the provided context within the historical account of Himachal Pradesh, held the position of a powerful ruler in northern India during the early 7th century CE. He was the king of the Vardhana dynasty, ruling over a kingdom that encompassed parts of modern-day Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. His reign lasted from 606 to 647 CE, and during his rule, he was known for his expansionist policies and intellectual pursuits. Harshavardhana's rise to power came after the decline of the Gupta Empire, which had previously held dominance over many smaller republics that constituted the region. Upon consolidating his power, Harshavardhana embarked on military campaigns to annex and conquer different territories. His missions played a crucial role in unifying different regions under his rule, leading to the formation of the mighty Harsha Empire. Although successful in his expansion strategies, King Harshavardhana's reign was also marked by a degree of decentralized governance, which allowed smaller kingdoms and chieftains to maintain local control. This approach, in turn, contributed to the region's subsequent division into various Rajput principalities governed by local rulers and chieftains. In addition to his military accomplishments, Harshavardhana was a patron of arts, literature, and education, earning him the status of a philosopher-king. He is known for initiating the Kumbh Mela, a mass Hindu pilgrimage, and supporting the renowned Chinese monk and scholar Xuanzang, who documented his travels and interactions with Harshavardhana in his writings. In summary, King Harshavardhana was an influential and powerful ruler of the Vardhana dynasty, who presided over the Harsha Empire during the early 7th century CE. Under his reign, the region experienced a brief period of supremacy, which ultimately dissolved into a decentralized political landscape marked by the presence of smaller, independent principalities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

Afterwards, they begin to live increasingly separate lives as Reggie becomes more involved with his biker friends, especially the eccentric Pete (Dudley Sutton). Reggie also loses interest in having sex with Dot.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Paragraph: Danny went camping and made a fire in the woods. he used large logs he fell a few months back. Bob was camping 300 yards away and he made a fire using small sticks, kindlings and sawdust he had left over. Bob's fire burned fast and bright. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time? Answer:","completion":"Bob didn't make a fire that burned for a longer time. Justification: As mentioned in the background information, when a given amount of solid is present as smaller particles, it provides a greater surface area, thus increasing the rate of reaction. In the paragraph, it is stated that Bob used small sticks, kindlings, and sawdust, which have a larger surface area than the large logs used by Danny for his fire. Consequently, Bob's fire burned fast and bright, indicating that his fire didn't last as long as Danny's, which burned relatively slowly due to the larger logs used."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The premise, \\"Should have remembered it if it was,\\" implies that if a piece of information or a detail was important or significant, it would have been remembered. It doesn't necessarily indicate the emotional state or feelings attached to the forgetting or remembering of the detail which is what the hypothesis tries to suggest. The hypothesis, \\"He was glad that he had forgotten that particular detail,\\" conveys an emotion of relief or happiness about the forgetting of a specific detail. This expression points toward the information being unfavorable or unpleasant to him, and he feels better having forgotten it. However, in the premise, we are not given any information about what type of information is being referred to, whether positive or negative, important or trivial, and so on. Nor is there any information about the emotional state of the person in question, whether they would feel glad, sad, indifferent, or any other emotion from forgetting the information.

The number of cases has been roughly similar over the last three years, but is 41% fewer than in 2008-2009. Last year there were 8,875 divorces, the lowest number recorded in Scotland since 1979. Divorces and dissolutions made up 95% of the 12,892 family cases started in 2015-16, an overall figure which has fallen by 13% since 2008-2009. Legal Affairs Minister Annabelle Ewing said: \\"I am pleased there has been such a dramatic fall in the number of people seeing their homes being repossessed, which continues a longer term downward trend. \\"This is thanks largely to historically low interest rates and is a positive indicator of Scotland's general economic picture. \\"The overall number of civil cases, which includes debt, damages and personal injury has fallen by over 40% in just seven years which is very encouraging.\\" A summary of the above article is?","completion":"The article highlights significant changes in Scotland's civil justice statistics, with the number of repossession court cases falling by 82% from 2008-2009 to 2015-2016.

Divorce rates in Scotland have also reached their lowest point since 1979, with 8,875 cases recorded in the last year. Legal Affairs Minister Annabelle Ewing attributed the decrease in repossession cases to low interest rates and an improving economic outlook in Scotland, while the overall decline in civil cases signifies a positive development for the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Precipitation can impact infiltration in many ways. The amount, type and duration of precipitation all have an impact. Rainfall leads to faster infiltration rates than any other precipitation events, such as snow or sleet. In terms of amount, the more precipitation that occurs, the more infiltration will occur until the ground reaches saturation, at which point the infiltration capacity is reached. Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated. This relationship between rainfall and infiltration capacity also determines how much runoff will occur. If rainfall occurs at a rate faster than the infiltration capacity runoff will occur. Now, I have a new situation: The weather phenomena this last month had an immense impact on Dirk county, the precipitation lead to many flood evens, the steady rain lead to massive water infiltration. 20 miles away, in Saulk county, they had a few thunderstorms, they had quite a bit of runoff, but less infiltration and less soil saturation.

Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy.

We are trying to find a special number (we call it \\"p\\") which makes both sides of the \\"scale\\" or equation equal. To start, let's get all the p's to one side of the equation. If we add 42*p (which is the same as picking up 42 blocks) from both sides of the equation, we get: 2402 = 55*p + 4877. Next, let's get rid of the \\"+ 4877\\" on the right side. To do that, we subtract 4877 (like removing 4877 candies from the right side) from both sides. Then we have: -2475 = 55*p. Next, we want 'p' all by itself on one side. To do that, we can divide the entire equation by 55 (which is like dividing a big pile of toys into 55 smaller piles), Then 'p' will be: p = -2475 / 55 After we do the division, we find that p = -45.

Xi Jinping (; Chinese: Xi Jin Ping ; pinyin: Xi Jinping; born 15 June 1953) is a Chinese politician currently serving as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, President of the People's Republic of China, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. As Xi holds the top offices of the party, the state, and the military, he is sometimes referred to as China's \\"paramount leader\\"; in 2016, the party officially gave him the title of \\"core\\" leader. Xi was appointed to the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007. Xi was ranked above Li Keqiang, an indication that he was going to succeed Hu Jintao as China's next leader. In addition, Xi also held the top-ranking membership of the Communist Party's Central Secretariat. This assessment was further supported at the 11th National People's Congress in March 2008, when Xi was elected as Vice-President of the People's Republic of China. Following his elevation, Xi has held a broad range of portfolios. He was put in charge of the comprehensive preparations for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, as well as being the central government's leading figure in Hong Kong and Macau affairs. In addition, he also became the new President of the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, the cadre-training and ideological education wing of the Communist Party. In the wake of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Xi visited disaster areas in Shaanxi and Gansu. Xi made his first foreign trip as vice president to North Korea, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Yemen from 17 to 25 June 2008. After the Olympics, Xi was assigned the post of Committee Chair for the preparations of the 60th Anniversary Celebrations of the founding of the People's Republic of China. He was also reportedly at the helm of a top-level Communist Party committee dubbed the 6521 Project, which was charged with ensuring social stability during a series of politically sensitive anniversaries in 2009. Xi is considered to be one of the most successful members of the Crown Prince Party, a quasi-clique of politicians who are descendants of early Chinese Communist revolutionaries. Former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, when asked about Xi, said he felt he was \\"a thoughtful man who has gone through many trials and tribulations.\\" Lee also commented: \\"I would put him in the Nelson Mandela class of persons. A person with enormous emotional stability who does not allow his personal misfortunes or sufferings affect his judgment. In other words, he is impressive\\". Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson described Xi as \\"the kind of guy who knows how to get things over the goal line.\\" Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that Xi \\"has sufficient reformist, party and military background to be very much his own man.\\" Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tweeted, \\"Xi hosting a meeting on women's rights at the UN while persecuting feminists?

An elderly Indian woman, who warns them that they must kill a boy to prevent one sister from killing the other, gives them each a pendant. As their startled horse runs off, Brigitte's foot is caught in a trap. Ginger seeks help, but the hunter frees Brigitte before she returns. He leads them to Fort Bailey, where they take refuge.

Write an article based on this summary: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has said he will never apologise for his \\"brave and plucky\\" decision to enter coalition with the Conservatives. Article:","completion":"Title: Nick Clegg Stands by His \\"Brave and Plucky\\" Decision to Enter Coalition with the Tories Introduction: In a recent statement, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg expressed his firm stand on his decision to enter into a coalition with the Conservatives, stating that he would never apologize for what he considers a \\"brave and plucky\\" move. Throughout his political career, Clegg has been synonymous with the coalition government that emerged in 2010 between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives, a partnership that has brought both successes and challenges for both parties. Body: Understanding Clegg's Decision: When the 2010 general elections resulted in a hung parliament, with the Conservative party securing the most seats but falling short of an outright majority, the idea of a coalition government was tossed around considerably. Nick Clegg, as leader of the third-place Liberal Democrats, had two options: support a minority Conservative government or form a coalition government with the Conservatives that would provide stability and decision-making power. Taking into account the nation's precarious political and economic climate at the time, Clegg made the bold decision to join forces with then-Prime Minister David Cameron. Prioritizing the needs of the British people and understanding the importance of having a strong, unified government, Clegg navigated through uncharted political waters, crossing traditional party lines. The Impact of the Coalition: The 2010-2015 coalition government marked the first time the Liberal Democrats held office since World War II, and in hindsight, the bold move allowed them to put forth many of their policies and principles. Under Clegg, the Lib Dems achieved key victories, such as increasing the personal tax allowance, supporting a greener economy, and promoting fairer chances for children through educational reform. However, it wasn't all smooth sailing for the Lib Dems during the coalition period. One major point of contention was their inability to fulfill their promise to oppose the increase in tuition fees for higher education. This issue would continue to plague the party in future election campaigns, as they struggled to regain the trust of their disillusioned supporters. Despite the challenges, the coalition government demonstrated that two opposing parties could work together for the betterment of the country. As a result, the British political landscape shifted significantly, allowing for more open dialogue and collaboration between traditionally rival parties. Clegg's Unwavering Stance: Since stepping down as leader of the Liberal Democrats in 2015, Nick Clegg has remained unwavering in his defense of his decision to enter into a coalition with the Conservatives. He has consistently argued that, in the context of an uncertain political landscape, the interests of the nation called for strong and stable leadership. Though plagued by controversy, Clegg's unapologetic approach showcases his dedication to the broader goals of responsible governance and collaboration. Despite facing backlash over the years, Clegg continues to stand firm in his belief that the decision was the right one for the United Kingdom. Conclusion: Nick Clegg's \\"brave and plucky\\" decision to enter into a coalition with the Conservatives may remain a contentious topic for years to come. However, his unwavering commitment to the decision serves as a reminder of the importance of making tough choices for the greater good of the nation and opens the possibility for more collaboration and understanding between rival parties in British politics. By refusing to apologize for his past decisions, Clegg emphasizes the importance of pragmatism and necessity in governing, as well as the courage needed to make the difficult decisions that can ultimately shape the future of the nation."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It discusses performance and results-based management (RBM) as well as providing guidelines related to RBM processes. Results-Based Management (RBM) is a strategic management approach that focuses on achieving results by consistently improving an organization's performance. It is often implemented by organizations, such as the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), that engage in international development projects. The primary objective of RBM is to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization by setting measurable goals, monitoring progress towards achieving those goals, and adapting strategies and processes as necessary. Key components of Results-Based Management (RBM): 1. Strategic Planning: The process of defining the organization's vision, mission, and strategic objectives. It also involves identifying the key results and performance indicators that will be used to assess progress towards these objectives. 2. Performance Monitoring: An ongoing process of measuring progress towards the achievement of the organization's objectives and results. This involves tracking performance indicators, reviewing progress reports, and evaluating whether the organization's strategies and actions are leading to the desired outcomes. 3. Evaluation: A systematic assessment of the efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability of an organization's programs, projects, or policies. Evaluation data is typically used to inform decision-makers of the success of various initiatives and to guide future planning and resource allocation. 4. Reporting and Accountability: A transparent process of communicating the organization's progress towards achieving its goals to stakeholders, such as donors, governmental bodies, or the public. This may involve the publication of annual performance reports, financial statements, or other relevant documentation. The RBM Guidelines would likely contain more detailed information and best practices on how to implement each of these components within the context of the Canadian International Development Agency. By following these guidelines, CIDA aims to improve its overall performance and maximize the impact of its international development efforts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Math Problem Solve 0 = 33*j - 16*j + 16*j + 429 for j.","completion":"To solve the equation, we must find the value of j that makes the equation true. Let's first simplify the equation step-by-step and then solve for j. Step 1: Combine the terms with 'j.' 0 = 33*j - 16*j + 16*j + 429 The equation has three terms with 'j': 33j, -16j, and 16j. To simplify this, we add the coefficients of the j terms together: 0 = (33 - 16 + 16)*j + 429 0 = (33)*j + 429 Step 2: Solve for j by isolating the variable on one side of the equation. We want to get rid of the constant term (429) from the right side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 429 from both sides: 0 - 429 = 33*j -429 = 33*j Now we need to get rid of the coefficient of j from the right side (33) to find j. We do this by dividing both sides by 33: -429 / 33 = 33*j / 33 -13 = j Step 3: Check the solution. Let's check if our solution is correct by substituting the value of j back into the original equation: 0 = 33*(-13) - 16*(-13) + 16*(-13) + 429 0 = -429 + 208 - 208 + 429 0 = 0 Since the left side of the equation is equal to the right side, our solution of j = -13 is correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest. But I can use this background: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3] What is an answer for this question: Was the breakdown of complex molecules lesser or greater in Valley Forest? A:","completion":"The breakdown of complex molecules was lesser in Valley Forest compared to Peak Forest. The main reason for this difference is the difference in moisture levels between the two forests. While both forests share similar rain amounts, Valley Forest has a drainage system composed of ditches that significantly reduces the rate of wood decay. As a result, the environment in Valley Forest is drier, and there is less moisture available for the growth and proliferation of wood-decay fungi, leading to a lower breakdown of complex molecules in this forest. Meanwhile, Peak Forest has a higher degree of water saturation, promoting more fungal activity and a greater rate of wood decay. Consequently, the breakdown of complex molecules is more extensive in Peak Forest due to the increased presence of fungi and their ability to decompose the wood material more effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last step of the aluminum recycling process is transforming the rolled aluminum sheets into new aluminum products. This involves several sub-processes, which are outlined below: 1. Manufacturing new aluminum products: The rolled aluminum sheets are then transported to manufacturing facilities where they will be used to create a wide range of new aluminum products. These products can include beverage cans, food packaging, automotive parts, construction materials, and various other aluminum-based items. The manufacturing process usually involves cutting, shaping, bending, and assembling the rolled aluminum sheets to form the desired products. 2. Quality control and testing: To ensure that the new aluminum products meet the required specifications and standards, they undergo quality control checks and testing procedures. This may include visual inspections, dimensional measurements, and strength testing, among other testing methods. The results of these tests ensure that the recycled aluminum meets the same high standards as virgin aluminum materials, and can be reliably used in a wide range of applications. 3. Finishing processes: Once the new aluminum products have been manufactured and tested, they may undergo various finishing processes to enhance their appearance, durability, and functionality. This can include surface treatments such as painting, plating, or anodizing to add color or improve corrosion resistance, as well as polishing or brushing to achieve a desired texture or shine. 4. Packaging and transportation: The finished aluminum products are then packaged and transported to distributors, retailers, or directly to end-users, depending on the specific product and supply chain arrangements. The recycled aluminum products are now ready for use, closing the loop in the aluminum recycling process and contributing to a more sustainable economy. In conclusion, the last step of the aluminum recycling process is the manufacturing and distribution of new aluminum products made from the recycled aluminum sheets. This process helps to conserve natural resources, reduce energy consumption, and minimize the environmental impact of aluminum production and usage. The recycled aluminum is ultimately reintroduced into the market, promoting a more sustainable and circular economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a summary based on this article: Once upon a time 20 years ago, the average San Francisco home cost the inflation-adjusted equivalent of 400,000. All one had to do was own a million-dollar home (or 1.5 million today) and they could be confidently among San Francisco’s wealthy elite. Ah, it was a simpler time. But now? Heck, every house costs at least a million dollars. They even advertise it. And the average income for both individuals and families is climbing every year. It takes a lot more riches just to be rich anymore. So who's rich and who's not in this crazy market? To alleviate this burning question, the local branch of investment firm Charles Schwab commissioned a survey of a 1,000 Bay Area residents to see what they think.To wit: \\"The survey of 1,000 Bay Area residents found that local residents think it takes about 2.5 million in most areas of the United States to be considered wealthy while a net worth of more than 6 million is what it takes to be wealthy in the Bay Area.\\" Ignoring for a moment the idea that 2 million doesn’t qualify as rich most places anymore, imagine how embarrassing it must be for anyone worth 3 million to find out that they only rate as middle class in the Bay Area. What will the neighbors think? Of course, this was only a survey of people’s opinions, meaning it’s less a hard numbers look at the cost of living so much as a glimpse into how people are feeling these days. Eighty-six percent of those polled say that the cost of living in the region is too high, 55 percent say they have trouble meeting their financial goals, and 68 percent say the Bay Area has one of the worst housing markets in the country.

A net worth of 1 million is the baseline for being \\"comfortable.\\" Excuse us while we take a quick break to cry into the 8 artisanal coffee that we really can't afford. Charles Schwab surveyed 1,000 Bay Area residents aged 21 to 75 in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Solano counties. The survey asked what residents considered enough money to be \\"wealthy\\" vs. \\"comfortable.\\" Respondents said they believed 2.5 million was the average needed to be wealthy in other parts of the country. Unsurprisingly, the survey also found that locals are shocked by the cost of living here. Eighty-six percent said the cost of living is \\"unreasonable\\" and 55-percent said living in the Bay Area makes it \\"difficult to reach their financial goals.\\" Only two percent agreed strongly that the cost of living in the Bay Area is reasonable. Who these people are, exactly, remains a question. Off-setting those depressing statistics are upbeat outlooks on job opportunities. Eighty percent believe the region is a great place for career growth, 88-percent say it's a prime place for innovation and 70-percent say the Bay Area's economy is better than the national one.

Investment firm Charles Schwab commissioned a survey of 1,000 Bay Area residents to explore their perceptions of wealth. The results showed that respondents believe it takes a net worth of around 2.5 million to be considered wealthy in most areas of the United States, while in the Bay Area, this figure jumps to over 6 million. Although this survey reflects people's opinions rather than concrete data, it offers insight into the sentiment of Bay Area residents. Among those surveyed, 86% believe that the cost of living in the region is too high, and 55% are struggling to meet their financial goals. Notably, 68% consider the Bay Area's housing market to be among the worst in the country.

Information: - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins. - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\" - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist. - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums.

With John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, he gained worldwide fame with the rock band the Beatles, largely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with Lennon is the most celebrated of the post-war era. After the band's break-up, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - \`\` Tell Me Why '' is a song by English rock band the Beatles from their album A Hard Day 's Night .

He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". - Skiffle is a music genre with jazz, blues, folk and American folk influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments. Originating as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century, it became popular again in the UK in the 1950s, where it was associated with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, The Vipers Skiffle Group, Ken Colyer and Chas McDevitt. Skiffle played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians and has been seen as a critical stepping stone to the second British folk revival, blues boom and British Invasion of the US popular music scene. - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. - \\"Beatlemania\\" is a term that originated and was coined during the early 1960s to describe the intense fan frenzy directed towards the English rock band the Beatles. The phenomenon began in 1963 and continued past the group's break-up in 1970, despite the band ceasing public performances in 1966. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits.

The aggregate movement gained momentum as the American Civil Rights Movement continued to grow, and became revolutionary with the expansion of the US government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. As the 1960s progressed, widespread social tensions also developed concerning other issues, and tended to flow along generational lines regarding human sexuality, women's rights, traditional modes of authority, experimentation with psychoactive drugs, and differing interpretations of the American Dream. Many key movements related to these issues were born, catalyzed, or advanced within the counterculture of the 1960s. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - John Winston Ono Lennon, (born John Winston Lennon; 9 October 19408 December 1980) was an English singer and songwriter who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. With fellow member Paul McCartney, he formed a celebrated songwriting partnership. - George Harrison, (25 February 1943 29 November 2001) was an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country.

How do I live a peaceful life? What is the easiest way to live a life? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Living a peaceful life and seeking the easiest way to live life may share some common elements, but they are not exactly the same question. Let's explore each question and the various aspects that contribute to both a peaceful and relatively easy life. 1. How do I live a peaceful life? To live a peaceful life, one should focus on personal well-being, strong relationships, developing a balanced outlook, and cultivating a harmonious environment. Below are some essential components for a peaceful life: a. Mindfulness: Developing mindfulness through meditation or other practices enables you to live in the present and remain aware of your thoughts and actions. This calm approach helps manage stress and anxiety, promoting a peaceful existence. b. Balance: Strive for balance in all areas of your life—work, relationships, physical activity, hobbies, and mental well-being. By maintaining equilibrium, you reduce stress and nurture a sense of peace. c. Healthy relationships: Strengthen your personal connections by prioritizing healthy communication, empathy, and support. The people you surround yourself with significantly impact your overall well-being, so choose those who contribute to your peaceful state of mind. d. Conflict resolution: Learn healthy conflict resolution strategies to maintain peace in your interactions and relationships. This includes empathetic listening, asserting your needs without aggression, and finding compromise. e. Self-care: Prioritize your mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Adopt consistent self-care routines, such as exercise, proper nutrition, adequate sleep, and relaxing activities to achieve optimal health and tranquility. f. Gratitude: Cultivate a sense of gratitude by acknowledging life's blessings and small joys. Embrace thankfulness for increased emotional well-being and peace of mind. g. Personal values: Identify, understand, and stay true to your personal values. Living a life aligned with your beliefs will bring you a sense of inner peace and integrity. 2. What is the easiest way to live a life? Seeking the easiest way to live life primarily revolves around reducing stress, mitigating hardships, and creating conditions that enable smoother daily functioning. Key elements to achieving this may include: a. Simplification: Simplify your life by decluttering your physical space, managing your time efficiently, and focusing on the essentials. By reducing unnecessary distractions, you create more time and energy for what truly matters. b. Planning and organization: Streamline your day-to-day tasks and responsibilities through planning and organization. Implement routines and proactive practices to decrease stress and enhance overall ease. c. Stress management: Identify stressors and work on strategies to minimize their impact. Learn relaxation techniques, compartmentalization, or seek professional help to address stress effectively. d. Flexibility: Cultivate flexibility to adapt to change more comfortably. Develop resilience to handle life's challenges with ease. e. Networking: Build a reliable support network of friends, family, and professionals to rely on in times of need. Establishing relationships with those who can both help and guide you will make life more manageable. f. Financial stability: Create a financial plan that keeps you on track to save, invest, and prepare for emergencies. Having a sense of financial stability will reduce stress and contribute to a more comfortable life. g. Continuous learning: Embrace continuous learning to improve your skills and abilities. Developing yourself will enable greater self-sufficiency and the capacity to navigate various challenges for a more effortless life. In conclusion, the questions about living a peaceful life and seeking the easiest way to live life share some aspects related to personal well-being, relationships, and stress management. However, peace is more focused on mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects, while ease is concerned with pragmatic approaches to simplify daily life.

Given the question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which friend heard more males producing a mating call? Bob and Andy were two nature enthusiasts. They went camping together once a month. Bob was into bird watching, while Andy was fascinated with frogs and salamanders. They went on a trip last week-end and they were very happy with what they had observed. Hint: You may hear males \\"ribbiting,\\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. The answer is:","completion":"Andy. The reasoning for this is that the paragraph states that Bob is into bird watching, while Andy is fascinated with frogs and salamanders. Given the hint, we know that the 'ribbiting' sound refers to a male frog's mating call. Since Andy is the friend interested in frogs and their behaviours, it logically follows that Andy would be the friend who heard more males producing a mating call during their camping trip. Thus the answer is Andy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"To identify whether the two questions are asking the same thing, let's analyze them separately. Question 1: This question is related to materials engineering and is asking whether EN24, a steel grade according to the British Standard, can be case-hardened. Case hardening is a heat treatment process that aims to increase the surface hardness of a material, typically steel, while keeping the core ductile. So, the topic of this question is about the properties and treatment of a specific material. Question 2: This question is about Indian law and specifically whether a person can be executed (hanged) twice for the same crime. It also asks if such a case has ever occurred in India. So, the topic of this question is Indian legal procedures and historical cases. After analyzing both questions separately, we can conclude that: 1. Question 1 is about materials engineering, specifically the properties and treatment of EN24 steel. 2. Question 2 is about Indian law and its application in specific cases. Now, to decide if these questions are asking the same thing, I will compare their topics and find out if there is any common subject: As Question 1 deals with material properties and Question 2 is concerning Indian law, there is no common subject or theme between the two questions.

Article: In a very special course at Knnet School, the social-science teacher Adam Smith guides his students through the \\"married life\\". Unlike the traditional course, Adam makes his students experience the real problems married ones may face like housing and child care. \\"No one tells kids about money-managing problems,\\" says Adam. Each student should act out in ten weeks what normally takes couples ten years to finish. In the first week, one member of each couple is asked to get an after school job -- a real one. During the term, the income rules their life-style. In the third week, the couples must find an apartment they can afford. In the fifth week, the couples \\"have a baby\\" and then struggle to cover the costs of baby clothes and furniture. In week eight, the marriage comes to the breaking point by such disaster as a mother-in-law's moving in or death. It's all over by week ten (the tenth year of marriage). After serious discussion with lawyers about alimony and child support, the students get divorced . Adam's course, which has \\"married\\" 1,000 students since its beginning six years ago, is widely supported by parents and students. Some of the students have found the experience making them realize their real life marry plans are wrong. Marianne Baldrica, 16, who tried \\"marriage\\" last term with her boyfriend Eric Zook, 15, said, \\" Eric and I used to get along pretty well before we took the course together.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"While there are similarities between a hard reset on a laptop and a hard reset on a phone, the two are not exactly the same due to the different functionalities, operating systems, and structures of these devices. Let's start by discussing what a hard reset does to a laptop: A hard reset, also referred to as a factory reset or master reset, essentially restores a laptop to its original factory settings. It eradicates all data, including files, apps, settings, and the operating system, providing a blank slate. This process is typically used when your computer is experiencing serious performance issues that can't be fixed through regular troubleshooting methods, such as system crashes, slow operation, or virus infestation. During a hard reset, the laptop's hard drive is completely erased and reconfigured as if it was brand new, meaning you lose everything that isn't backed up. Post-reset, the laptop's operating system needs to be reinstalled or restored from a backup. Now, let's discuss what a hard reset does to a phone: Similarly to a laptop, a hard reset, sometimes referred to as a factory reset, on a phone removes all data, apps, and settings, restoring the phone back to its original factory settings. It's like taking your phone right out of the box for the first time in terms of software configuration. It can be used to solve a variety of issues such as unresponsiveness, recurring errors, sluggishness, or whenever you plan to sell or give away the phone to ensure all your private data is removed. However, there are certain differences as compared to a laptop reset. Mobile phone operating systems, such as Android or iOS, have a built-in option for factory resetting which doesn't require reinstallation of the operating system after the reset. All applications and bloatwares that were pre-installed on the phone when you first got it are automatically restored. To answer your final question, while both processes involve restoring a device to its factory settings and erase all personal data and settings, the implication and execution process differ because of the distinct operating systems, file structures, functions, and the way data is stored in laptops and phones. In essence, doing a hard reset on these devices has the same goal - to wipe the device clean and resolve any problems that couldn't be addressed by normal troubleshooting techniques, but the process to achieve this goal may be slightly different. Hence, while these questions appear similar on the surface, they refer to somewhat different processes depending on the type of device."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Of all the areas of learning the most important is the development of attitudes. Emotional reactions as well as logical thought processes affect the behavior of most people. \\"The burnt child fears the fire\\" is one instance; another is the rise of figures like Hitler. Both these examples point up the fact that attitudes come from experience. In the one case the experience was direct and impressive; in the other it was indirect and gradual. The classroom teacher in the elementary school is in strategic position to influence attitudes. This is true partly because children acquire attitudes from those adults whose word they respect. Another reason it is true is that pupils often search somewhat deeply into a subject in school that has only been touched upon at home or has possibly never occurred to them before. To a child who has previously acquire little knowledge of Mexico, his teacher's method of handling such a unit would greatly affect his attitude toward Mexicans. The teacher can develop proper attitudes through social studies, science matters, the very atmosphere of the classroom, etc. However, when children come to school with undesirable attitudes, it is unwise to attempt to change their feelings by criticizing them. The teacher can achieve the proper effect by helping them obtain constructive experience. To illustrate, first-grade pupils, afraid of policemen will probably change their attitudes after a classroom talk with the neighborhood officer in which he explains how he protects them. In the same way, a class of older children can develop attitudes through discussion, research, outside reading and all-day trips. Finally, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes, because her influence can be harmful she has personal prejudices. This is especially true in respect to controversial issues and questions of which children should be encouraged to reach their own decisions as result of objective analysis of all the facts. Question: In the author's opinion, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes because _ . Options: A: her personal attitudes may affect her students if she is prejudiced B: she need to improve herself too C: she is also often influenced by her students D: she may not have a constant attitude towards some controversial sues The answer is:","completion":"A: her personal attitudes may affect her students if she is prejudiced"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. This isn't the first time Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has faced allegations that he's racist. Audio recordings from a conversation full of racist comments attributed to Sterling surfaced over the weekend, bringing national attention to him and his team. But the billionaire real estate mogul has found himself in hot water in the past, denying in court accusations of discrimination tied to the NBA team and to property he owns. A top team executive accused Sterling of running the Clippers with a \\"plantation\\" mentality. Federal prosecutors accused his rental company of refusing to lease Beverly Hills apartments to African-Americans. And a group of tenants accused him of \\"numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices.\\" \\"Actions speak louder than words, and Mr. Sterling's actions have been consistent,\\" former NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar told CNN's \\"The Lead with Jake Tapper\\" on Monday. Abdul-Jabbar, who coached the Clippers for about three months in 2000, said Sterling has \\"a bad reputation.\\" \\"I'm not surprised by this very much,\\" he said, \\"and that's really the most unfortunate part of this.\\" Sterling, who has not publicly commented about the recordings, has owned the team for more than three decades. Clippers President Andy Roeser said Sunday that Sterling is upset and \\"emphatic that what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect, his views, beliefs or feelings.\\" Here's a look at what court documents reveal about several claims made against Sterling in the past:. 2009: Clippers' former general manager files a wrongful termination lawsuit. Elgin Baylor, who was executive vice president and general manager of the Clippers from 1986 to 2008, filed a lawsuit alleging wrongful termination against Sterling in 2009, saying that the team's owner underpaid him and treated him \\"as a token because of his race.\\" Baylor, who is African-American and an 11-time NBA All-Star, said Sterling wouldn't let him negotiate players' salaries and had a vision of a \\"Southern Plantation type structure\\" for the team. Sterling, according to Baylor's complaint, told Baylor repeatedly that he \\"wanted the CLIPPERS team to be composed of 'Poor Black boys from the South' and a White head coach.\\" The lawsuit also accuses Sterling of ageism and alleges that Sterling harassed him by making demeaning comments about his age. Sterling denied those accusations and said the team acted within its rights and \\"for good cause and not for any improper reason.\\" Before the case went to trial, Baylor dropped the racial discrimination claim but maintained accusations of age discrimination. A jury sided with Sterling in 2011. At the time, the jury's foreman said jurors believed Baylor was fired because the \\"team hadn't been performing,\\" according to the Los Angeles Times. 2006: Justice Department accuses Sterling of housing discrimination. A Justice Department lawsuit filed in 2006 accused Sterling's rental company of refusing to lease Beverly Hills apartments to African-Americans, refusing to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown section of Los Angeles County and turning away families with children from its properties. That case was settled in 2009, with Sterling agreeing to pay nearly 3 million but continuing to deny the accusations. \\"The magnitude of this settlement should send a message to all landlords that we will vigorously pursue violations of the Fair Housing Act,\\" Thomas E. Perez, then head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said at the time. Robert Platt, a lawyer for the Sterling Family Trust, said at the time that the settlement includes no admission of liability and the government \\"could not identify a single individual who was wrongfully denied the right to rent an apartment from the trust.\\" He said the company had a \\"zero-tolerance\\" policy regarding discrimination. \\"My clients vehemently and unequivocally deny that anyone was discriminated against,\\" Platt said in a written statement on the settlement. \\"Nevertheless, the insurance companies for the trust decided to settle the case because the cost of continued litigation far exceeded the cost of settlement.\\" 2003: Tenants, nonprofit allege housing discrimination. The nonprofit Housing Rights Center and a group of tenants who lived in Sterling's properties filed a federal lawsuit in 2003 against Sterling, accusing him of \\"numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices,\\" according to court documents. Court documents allege that Sterling told building staff that he did not like Hispanic or African-American tenants and that he preferred Korean-American tenants and made \\"disparaging comments\\" about African-American and Hispanic tenants. They also allege that Sterling's company refused to accept rent from African-American and Latino tenants -- then later attempted \\"to use the tenants' supposed failure to pay rent as a basis for eviction.\\" And they claim that African-American and Latino tenants were asked to sign in as visitors at apartment buildings where they had long lived. Sterling, according to court documents, \\"vehemently denied\\" the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of \\"being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas.\\" The case was dismissed in 2005 after a settlement was reached. Details of the deal were not disclosed. According to court documents, a judge ordered Sterling to pay nearly 5 million in attorney's fees to the plaintiffs. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Donald Sterling, who owns the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, has faced allegations of making racist comments in the past. Some people say he runs the team with a \\"plantation\\" mentality, which means treating people unfairly because of their race. He even had lawsuits filed against him before, accusing him of not wanting to rent apartments to African-Americans and making rude comments about other races. Sterling has denied these accusations, and some lawsuits have been settled or decided in his favor. However, some people still believe his actions are consistent with racism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

That dreaded time in May that I hate so much. Tomorrow around 3:15 a.m. you will have died in my arms, 4 years ago. I still don’t know the exact time because I never sent in for your death certificate. I keep telling myself I’m going to do it, but I just can’t seem to bring myself to fill out the paperwork just so I can have a certificate that says you are dead. That makes everything all too real and the tiniest piece of me is still holding out hope that this is all in fact just some sick twisted experiment about what happens to a mom after she watches her son die from cancer. I saw that movie “The Truman Show” many years ago, so why can’t that be what happens to me? If I tell you what happens almost 4 years later of you being dead, do you think somebody will drop you off at our doorstep so we can finally be reunited? I still look for you every time our doorbell rings. I don’t think that will ever change. So, almost 4 years later and what can I tell you? I can tell you this: Life sometimes feels really hard. As in bring me to my knees, I’m giving up hard. I still have days that I just want throw in the towel and run away from everything. I still have days where sometimes I can’t go to your brothers baseball games because I can’t get over the fact that you are not on that field, following in their amazing footsteps. I still have days where I am so angry at the stupidest things such as the sunshine, laughter from the Television, or even the new Star Wars movie that is coming out because it kills me that you will not be here to see it. I still have days where my tears are uncontrollable and my anger is directed at all the wrong people, but those days have become less and less. I have learned a lot in the 4 years of your death. I have learned a lot by also having my father die just 5 short months ago. Mostly that life is fucking fucked up and can be totally unfair, but it is up to me to make the most of what I have been handed, even if it is the most horrific thing a mother can endure. I have learned to let go of a lot of my anger. I am learning to be less judgmental and more compassionate towards other people. I have learned that the human spirit is one of the most incredible things in the world. I have learned that the sorrow I feel every single day pushes me to do better, be better, do more, say less, say more when necessary, to love the people in my life harder than I ever knew I was capable of loving after losing you. I have learned that with a very broken heart, I am capable of feeling and giving love again. I never truly thought I would be able to feel things like love and happiness again, but I can and sometimes I am even able to let go of all of my hurt and get lost in it for just a bit. I am hopeful about the future and hope is a word that I hated for such a long time, but now it doesn’t seem to taste so bitter. I wake up everyday knowing even after losing you to cancer, I am still the luckiest mama. Your brothers are still the most incredible boys and that sister of yours… well, I can say without a doubt that she is the one who brought hope back into my life. She has saved me in a way and reminds me everyday how incredible it is to be alive, full of life, innocence, and feistiness. She reminds me of all the beauty in the world and that everyday we are here, life should be full of laugher, love, and adventure. I am so thankful to have a little person in our house again who calls me mama. Your brothers out grew the mama thing long ago. It is nice to hear the pitter-patter of feet running down the hallway again and the trouble that comes with it. Trouble once again consists of things such as coloring on the walls, covering our dog, Teddy with lipgloss or applying my blush she hijacked from my drawer all over her face. Just the kind of trouble I have missed and love so much. It is nice to have some innocent trouble back in our house again. It always reminds me so much of you. Tonight, Poppy fell asleep so peacefully in my arms. 4 years ago tonight, you were doing the same thing but only to die soon after. My heart is so heavy, sad, and broken still. I am forever so sorry and would still trade places with you in an instant. I miss you so much, but especially on nights like tonight when every cell in my body can feel you leaving this world again. Tomorrow night on the anniversary of your death I have to stand on a stage and give a speech for an award I am being given. I am so humbled by the honor and so proud to share your story, but I quite simply don’t know how I am going to be able to function let alone give a speech in front of hundreds of people. I just keep hearing the words of one of the people I love most in the world telling me, “I promise you, Ronan will be with you tomorrow night. He is going to be watching you and right there with you. He won’t let you do this without him.” Please let that be true. And please don’t let me get up on the stage and just crumble up in a ball because I am just too sad to speak. I need you to surround me and give me the strength to be strong on the day that you died so I can make you proud and so we can help other people.

The Games were not devoid of controversies, particularly in the sailing category where three protests were lodged questioning the result of Sunday's 49er skiff Olympic sailing medal race. This event was hosted in Qingdao, a place known for its expansive shipyards. This industrial city underwent a substantial transformation as its shipyard was converted into an Olympic sailing center. This change symbolized a significant shift in the cityscape, denoting its transition from industrial to sports-centric activities. However, while the city prepared to welcome athletes from around the world, it faced a massive environmental challenge in the form of harmful algal bloom at its coastline. This excessive growth of algae threatened to impede the sailing competition. The authorities undertook a significant clean-up operation to clear the green algae. Thousands of citizens from Qingdao were mobilized to tackle this unexpected environmental crisis. The local populace conscientiously joined forces to clean up their coastline, with the mutual objective of ensuring the smooth conduction of the competition. In the end, the collective efforts bore fruit, and an official confirmed that the clean-up operation was successful. This display of solidarity in the face of adversity underscored the determination of the Qingdao people. Not only did they manage to transform their shipyard into a sailing center for the Olympics, but they also succeeded in overcoming a significant environmental challenge to successfully host the sailing event. The 2008 Beijing Olympics was indeed an eventful occasion, significantly marked by the persistent efforts of John Dane III, the controversies surrounding the 49er skiff race, and the monumental transformation and remedial environmental efforts of the city of Qingdao."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: All people need to sleep. Sleep is a necessary process that promotes proper body functioning and can improve the quality of your life. Not only is the quantity of sleep important, but also the quality of sleep. Your bedroom should be shaped to your taste and to allow you to sleep in a peaceful environment. One of the biggest mistakes people make in their sleep is to use their bedroom for activities other than sleep. If your bedroom also functions as a command station for your life and work, the likelihood of your sleeping being poor is rather high. Bedrooms should be designed, decorated and used for mainly sleep. TVs, computers and other things should not be in your bedroom if at all possible. Establishing regular sleeping and waking times can help improve the quality of your sleep especially for those suffering from sleeplessness. Avoid hot food, caffeine, sugar and alcohol at least 4 to 6 hours before your sleep time. Develop a regular exercise program. Proper exercise and nutrition will help improve sleeping patterns. However, avoid exercising 2 hours before sleeping, since this may stimulate your body and make sleeping more difficult. Establish a pre-bedtime rule that will help focus you on sleep. You can try meditation ,reading or deep breathing and relaxation. Your bedtime rule should be yours. Do not worry about it fitting into a specific category. Do what is the best for you. Things such as room temperature, noise and light levels and even your bed mattress can have a lot of effect on the quality of sleep that you experience. Block out distracting noises and lights.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive. Which car would contribute to less cleaner atmosphere, car A or car B?","completion":"Between car A and car B, it is car B that would contribute to a less cleaner atmosphere. This answer is based on the presence of a catalytic converter in car A and the absence of one in car B. A catalytic converter is an essential component of the exhaust system in a vehicle that helps reduce the emission of harmful gases into the environment. It does this by converting these toxic gases, which include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons, into less harmful substances such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. Since car A is newer and equipped with a catalytic converter, it would contribute to a cleaner atmosphere as opposed to car B, which lacks this environmental protection measure. Even though John might find the design of car B more attractive, in terms of making a choice that is more environmentally responsible, he should consider opting for car A because its emission profile is significantly better. However, it is essential to consider other factors as well when making a choice about a car's contribution to the environment. These factors include fuel economy, maintenance requirements, and the type of fuel used (gasoline, diesel, or alternative fuels such as electric or hydrogen). A car with better fuel economy is more environmentally friendly because it requires less fuel to cover the same distance, which in turn lowers emissions. Additionally, proper maintenance and the use of cleaner fuels can significantly improve a car's emission profile. In conclusion, car A, with its catalytic converter, would contribute to a cleaner atmosphere compared to car B, which lacks this critical component. However, John should also take other factors into account, such as fuel economy and car maintenance, to make the most environmentally responsible choice for his next automotive purchase."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Greek myth who was the Titan of memory and remembrance, and mother of the nine Muses????","completion":"In Greek mythology, the Titan of memory and remembrance is Mnemosyne, and she is the mother of the nine Muses. The name 'Mnemosyne' is derived from the Greek word 'mneme,' which means memory or remembrance. She is the daughter of the primordial deities Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky), and she is one of the twelve Titans, the older generation of gods who preceded the Olympians. Mnemosyne, as the personification of memory, played a significant role in ancient Greek culture and thought. Memory was considered essential in the oral tradition, which was the primary means by which stories, myths, history, and other knowledge were passed down through generations. As a Titan, Mnemosyne belonged to the generation that ruled before the Olympian gods came to power, but unlike several of her siblings who faced the wrath of the Olympians, Mnemosyne continued to have a role in the new divine order. The nine Muses are the daughters of Mnemosyne and the supreme god Zeus. They were conceived after the deities had spent nine consecutive nights together. The Muses personify arts and aspects of knowledge, playing a vital role in inspiring poets, musicians, and other creative individuals. The nine Muses and their respective domains are as follows: 1. Calliope - The Muse of epic poetry 2. Clio - The Muse of history 3. Erato - The Muse of love poetry 4. Euterpe - The Muse of music and lyric poetry 5. Melpomene - The Muse of tragedy 6. Polyhymnia - The Muse of hymns and sacred poetry 7. Terpsichore - The Muse of dance and choral poetry 8. Thalia - The Muse of comedy and idyllic poetry 9. Urania - The Muse of astronomy The concept of the Muses gained considerable importance in ancient Greece, where the arts were highly valued. Artists, poets, and philosophers often invoked the Muses before they began their work, seeking guidance, inspiration, and blessings to ensure successful and creative outcomes. In summary, Mnemosyne, the Titan of memory and remembrance, is a key figure in Greek mythology and the mother of the nine Muses. Her role in personifying memory and her connection with the Muses underlines the significance of memory and artistic inspiration in ancient Greek society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

British children under ten are being turned into 'junior jihadis' as extremists bombard them with dangerous propaganda, London's deputy mayor warned today. Stephen Greenhalgh revealed he and Boris Johnson have both been briefed about radicalised primary school pupils as fears grow extremists are using the capital to spread hate. His stark comments came ahead of a private meeting with police commissioners from across Britain to discuss the alarming spread in Iraq and Syria of the militant group Isis. Stark warning: London's deputy mayor Stephen Greenhalgh (left) warned today that authorities are telling him about cases of Islamic extremists under the age of ten. Fears have grown over the rise of Isis (right) Radicalised: Many of the extremists fighting with Isis are young and hundreds of jihadis are thought to be from Britain. Pictured, militants who allegedly seized an Iraqi army checkpoint in Salahuddi this week. 'Some of them are very young,' he told the Evening Standard. 'We are talking about under the age of ten. 'It starts very young with them being subjected to propaganda, extremist ideology, and being trained to be junior jihadis. 'It’s pretty horrendous when you hear how some of these children are being radicalised. The threat of radicalisation of young people is real and this is a problem that is going to be with us not just for a couple of years, but for the next generation.' Tory Mr Greenhalgh, 47, is the politician in charge of London's policing and crime. His comments came ahead of a private meeting today with police and crime commissioners from Britain's largest cities to discuss the growing threat of Islamic extremism. Frightening: The group's influence has spread through the use of social media and analysts fear disaffected young people inner-city areas such as London, Birmingham or Manchester could be particularly vulnerable. Worry: Mr Greenhalgh (left) said he and London mayor Boris Johnson had both been briefed on cases of primary school children who have been subjected to extremist propaganda, a problem he said is here to stay. According to the Standard, those attending included the police commissioners for Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds alongside Scotland Yard's former counter-terrorism chief Commander Helen Ball. The outcome of the behind-closed-doors meeting, which was also attended by the House of Lords' former anti-terror supremo Lord Carlile, has not been disclosed. The Home Office already fears around 500 Britons have left the country to fight with extremist groups in Iraq and Syria, some of them still in school. In July it emerged 16-year-old star college pupils Salma and Zahra Halane, from Chorlton, Manchester, had abandoned their homes to fly to the rapidly expanding warzone. Disaffected youths in parts of east London, which has the combination of a large Muslim population and high deprivation and unemployment, are feared to be particularly vulnerable to hate preachers. Today a think tank said there was a real and present danger of some of those fighting in Iraq and Syria carrying out terrorist bombings when they returned home. The Henry Jackson Society, whose previous supporters have included the former education secretary Michael Gove, said the odds of a 'blowback' attack should not be underestimated. Between 1999 and 2010, it said, 19 per cent of all terrorists had received foreign training - but this figure rose to 41 per cent for those directly involved in the eight major bomb plots on Western soil. 'At least 500 British Muslims have travelled to Syria,' it said, 'with up to 300 already back on British soil.' The report added: 'For almost three decades, small numbers of British Muslims have fought for Islamist terrorist groups abroad and/or travelled to foreign conflict zones and ungoverned spaces to receive training from terrorist groups, most notably al-Qaeda-affiliated training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Fight: Isis militants have swept through Iraq and Syria, including the Iraqi city of Mosul (pictured in June), enforcing an extreme interpretation of Sharia law under their version of Sunni Islam. Worry: It is not only Britons who have gone to fight abroad - Interpol is searching for these two teenage girls from Austria. Samra Kesinovic, 16, and her friend Sabina Selimovic, 15, both come from Bosnian refugee families. 'Upon their return, a small but significant number of these were involved in specific terrorist plots and attacks; the radicalising impact of others has been widely evident across numerous terrorism offences in the UK to date.' A row erupted last month after a black flag said to resemble that of Islamic State was hoisted over the gates of a housing estate in Poplar, east London - only to be torn down by a furious nun. Sister Christine Frost, 77, a nun who works at a nearby church, used a stepladder to remove the flag out of fear it could be seen as 'aggressive' or 'insensitive'. The flag had been raised next to others calling for Palestinian freedom, but anti-extremist campaigners said the raising of the black flag was a 'provocative' act and undermined legitimate anger about last month's violence in Gaza. Islamic State militants have swept through huge tracts of Iraq and Syria, taking authorities by surprise and enforcing an extreme interpretation of Sharia law under their version of Sunni Islam.

It was also a good day for the other top-four sides with Crusaders beating Ballinamallard 1-0, Linfield winning 2-0 at Ards and Ballymena fighting back to defeat Glentoran 3-2. Dungannon overcame Carrick 3-1 and Glenavon beat Coleraine 1-0. As it happened: Saturday's Premiership action Currie hoped to begin his Ports reign by ending the club's horror record against the Reds - 11 straight defeats without registering a goal against the north Belfast side. That run was extended as the visitors failed to take advantage of having an extra player from the 23rd minute. Ives saw his powerful shot diverted into his own net by Garry Breen six minutes before McGuinness was shown a straight red card. Tempers flared after a heavy challenge on Reds keeper Peter Burke and McGuinness pushed his head into Breen. Portadown rarely threatened an equaliser and inform Cliftonville remain six points adrift of pacesetters Crusaders. The champions have made a habit of grinding out narrow wins this season and they did it again at Ferney Park. Jordan Forsythe netted the only goal with his first-half effort slipping under the body of keeper Cameron Crawford and into the net. It was a bit easier for second-placed Linfield as Jimmy Callacher bagged a first-half double against managerless Ards. The defender headed in the opener and added a close-range finish before the break. It was a game to remember for Ballymena at the Oval, coming from two down to clinch victory with Johnny McMurray's injury-time winner. Adam McCracken's own goal and a Stephen McAlorum strike put the Glens in charge but Fra McCaffrey and Tony Kane scored before McMurray won it. Rhys Marshall headed Glenavon to victory over Coleraine at Mourneview Park, connecting with Joel Cooper's corner early in the second half. Ally Taggart, Ryan Harpur and Andrew Mitchell were on target for Dungannon in their 3-1 win against Carrick, with Stephen McCullough's superb long-range goal the only highlight for the visitors.","completion":"In the Northern Ireland Football Premiership, Levi Ives scored an own goal and Stephen McGuinness was sent off as Niall Currie's reign as Ports boss began poorly.

The answer to the question: What were the last names of the two people Coke met in Italy? is inside the article: Holkham was built by 1st Earl of Leicester, Thomas Coke, who was born in 1697. A cultivated and wealthy man, Coke made the Grand Tour in his youth and was away from England for six years between 1712 and 1718. It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting. He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio.

Developing a comprehensive and diverse college course curriculum is essential for educational institutions to provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to excel in their respective fields. In this article, we will discuss the steps necessary to create an effective course list for a college, review existing curriculum models, and outline the key components required for each course. Step 1: Assemble a list of courses for your college To create a successful course curriculum, it is essential to first determine the courses your college will offer. Consider the institution's primary focus and major disciplines when deciding which subjects to include.

To do this, follow these guidelines: a) Determine the course objectives: Establish clear and attainable objectives reflecting the skills and knowledge the students should acquire upon completing the course. b) Develop assignments and assessments: Create a variety of tasks and assessments, such as written exams, practical projects, and group presentations, to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of student learning and achievement. c) Design a lesson plan: Develop a structured plan detailing the course timeline, key topics, and resources required for each lesson. Ensure lessons progress logically, building on previous material and introducing new concepts in an accessible manner. d) Incorporate active learning strategies: Include opportunities for students to engage in discussions, problem-solving exercises, and collaborations to foster a more inclusive and dynamic learning environment. e) Promote inclusivity and accessibility: Ensure that course materials, assignments, and technology are accessible to all students, considering varying needs and learning styles. Step 4: Create a list of required materials for each course To provide a seamless learning experience, it is essential to have a list of necessary course materials at hand. This list should include: a) Textbooks: Identify the primary and supplementary texts required to comprehend and support course content. b) Academic journals & articles: To encourage further reading and research, provide students with a list of relevant academic journals and articles. c) Software & tools: If the course necessitates the use of specific software, tools, or equipment, compile a list and provide information on their acquisition or access. d) Online resources: Include links to relevant websites, online databases, and multimedia resources to augment learning. e) Supplemental materials: Provide any additional resources that support course content, such as lecture slides, infographics, and study aids.
