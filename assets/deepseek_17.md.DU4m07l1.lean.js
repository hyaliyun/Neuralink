Once The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: Once in a Lifetime Genre: Drama, Adventure, Romance Plot Summary: 'Once in a Lifetime' is a heartwarming, thrilling, and romantic tale of two strangers, Alex and Emma, who accidentally cross paths during a one-time-only celestial event: the sudden appearance of a mysterious comet that circles the Earth once every thousand years. Upon its arrival, the enchanting comet somehow grants those who gaze upon it the rare opportunity to change a single moment in their lives, offering a second chance for love and adventure. Act 1: Meet Alex, an ambitious but overworked architect struggling to find balance between his career and his passion for travel and photography. After witnessing a breathtaking meteor shower, he stumbles upon a strange and alluring woman named Emma, a talented artist who has been chasing her dreams of fame but feels disenchanted by the superficiality of the art world. Realizing they both share a love for the night sky, they decide to embark on an adventure to witness the unique celestial event – the appearance of a once-in-a-lifetime comet. With every mile, their bond grows stronger as they discover an inexplicable connection to the cosmos. Act 2: As the comet draws nearer, Alex and Emma find themselves grappling with their own inner demons, desires, and past regrets while uncovering unimaginable secrets about the comet itself. They learn that the cosmic wanderer holds the key to changing one pivotal moment in their lives, thus offering a chance to rewrite history and seek redemption. Torn between seizing this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and the consequences of altering their destiny, they grapple with difficult choices, ultimately realizing that they have the power to not only transform their own lives but the lives of others as well. Act 3: On the day of the comet, Alex and Emma make the monumental decision to embrace their newfound potential and explore the world together, not as strangers but as companions. They decide to use the comet's power not to reshape their individual pasts but to create an unforgettable and extraordinary shared future. As they stare into the night sky hand-in-hand, the dazzling beauty of the comet above reflects the transformative love and adventure that lies before them. The answer to how many times they should see this movie in a lifetime is, fittingly, once - much like the comet's rare and mysterious journey. In the end, 'Once in a Lifetime' leaves viewers with a lasting message about the importance of self-discovery, the power of connection, and the beauty of embracing the unknown. It is a story that inspires us to cherish the magical, fleeting moments that life has to offer and serves as a reminder to open our hearts to the wonders of the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

What is the density of an object having a mass of 5.0g and a volume of 45.0 cm^3? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available options: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"Let's answer the questions one by one: 1. What is the density of an object with mass 9.03g and a volume of 0.1987mL? To determine the density of an object, we use the formula: Density (ρ) = Mass (m) / Volume (V) In this case, the mass (m) is 9.03 grams, and the volume (V) is 0.1987 milliliters. To calculate the density, we plug the values into the formula: ρ = 9.03g / 0.1987mL ρ ≈ 45.40 g/mL So, the density of this object is approximately 45.40 grams per milliliter. 2. What is the density of an object having a mass of 5.0g and a volume of 45.0 cm^3? Again, we'll use the formula: Density (ρ) = Mass (m) / Volume (V) In this case, the mass (m) is 5.0 grams, and the volume (V) is 45.0 cm^3. Since the volume is given in cubic centimeters, we should convert it into milliliters for consistency. Since 1 cm^3 is equal to 1 mL, there's no need for conversion: ρ = 5.0g / 45.0mL ρ ≈ 0.111 g/mL So, the density of this object is approximately 0.111 grams per milliliter. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Available options: 1). no; 2). yes; The answer is 1). no. The questions do not have the same meaning because they are asking to find the density of objects with different masses and volumes. Although they both inquire about density, the specific values are different, resulting in different densities for each object."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who wears a priestly collar for security? The film opens with an English schoolteacher, Gwen Mayfield, packing up her belongings at a mission school in colonial Africa. The local witch doctors have led a rebellion, and they reach the school before she is able to escape—the shaman wearing a body mask. Gwen screams, and the scene dissolves to the opening credits. The next scene is back home in England, where Gwen meets with the apparently Reverend Alan Bax for a job interview. We discover that Gwen suffered a nervous breakdown from whatever she experienced at the hand of the rebels when the school was attacked. Alan is impressed by Gwen and hires her to be the new head teacher at the small private school he and his sister, well-known journalist Stephanie Bax, run for the local children in the village of Heddaby. Upon moving into the teacher's cottage, Gwen asks her maid, Valerie Creek, where she might find the rectory. Valerie is confused—she knows there is no rectory—until Gwen explains she would like to thank Mr. Bax. \\"Oh, you mean the Baxes' house!\\" she says, and shows her the way after tea. At the house, Gwen meets Stephanie and mentions she tried to look for the church on the way but couldn't find it. Stephanie explains there isn't any church, and no \\"Reverend Alan Bax\\"—but that the pretence is completely harmless. Alan shows Gwen the old church, now a ruin, as he walks her home. He confesses to her that he is not really a priest—\\"I wanted to enter the Church, but I failed.\\" He notes that he does not try to persuade anyone or officiate, but sometimes wears the priestly collar \\"for security.\\" Gwen tries to find out more about why the old church was left a ruin but Alan mysteriously turns silent and seems to be unable to move, so she says good night and leaves him to his thoughts.

The long strait divides the island of Karmøy on the west and the mainland of Norway and island of Vestre Bokn in the east. The strait runs through the municipalities of Haugesund, Karmøy, and Bokn. The town of Haugesund lies at the northern end of the strait and the town of Kopervik lies in the central part of the strait, and the village of Skudeneshavn lies near the southern end where the strait flows into the Boknafjorden. The Karmsund Bridge, a part of the European route E134 highway, links Karmøy to the mainland. The bridge was completed in 1955. The small islands of Vibrandsøy, Risøy, and Hasseløy lie in the strait at the northern end, just off shore from the town of Haugesund. - Avaldsnes is a village in Karmøy municipality in Rogaland county, Norway. The village is located on the northeastern part of the island of Karmøy, along the Karmsundet strait, just south of the town of Haugesund. The village was an ancient centre of power on the west coast of Norway and is the site of one of Norways more important areas of cultural history. The trading port of Notow and the Avaldsnes Church are two notable historic sites in Avaldsnes. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - Location. The town is situated on a strategically important sound, the Karmsundet, through which ships could pass without traversing heavy seas. In the early years, the coastal waters off Haugesund were a huge source of herring, and the town grew accordingly. Despite being barely a village back then, King Harald Fairhair lived at Avaldsnes, very close to the modern town of Haugesund. In the last decades, the town, like its neighbours, has been turning towards the petroleum industry, with the herring being long gone. - Harald Fairhair (Old Norse: \\"Haraldr Hárfagri\\", Norwegian: \\"Harald Hårfagre\\", (literally \\"Harald Hair-fair\\") ; 850 932) is remembered by medieval historians as the first King of Norway. According to traditions current in Norway and Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, he reigned from 872 to 930. Most of his life remains uncertain, since the extant accounts of his life in the sagas were set down in writing around three centuries after his lifetime. A few remnants of skaldic praise poems attributed to contemporary court poets exist which seem to refer to Harald's victories against opponents in Norway. The information supplied in these poems is inconsistent with the tales in the sagas in which they are transmitted, and the sagas themselves often disagree on the details of his background and biography. Two of his sons, Eric Bloodaxe and Haakon the Good, succeeded Harald to become kings after his death. - Fotballklubben Haugesund is a Norwegian football club from the city of Haugesund .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Would fork A needed John to move it more or less quickly than fork B? John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude. Hint: The frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. For example, to generate a higher-frequency wave in a rope, you must move the rope up and down more quickly. This takes more energy, so a higher-frequency wave has more energy than a lower-frequency wave with the same amplitude. You can see examples of different frequencies in the Figure below (Amplitude is the distance that particles of the medium move when the energy of a wave passes through them.) The answer to this question is:","completion":"Fork A would need John to move it more quickly than fork B. The reason for this is that fork A produces a higher frequency compared to fork B. As hinted, the frequency of a wave is directly related to the frequency of the vibrations that caused the wave. In order to generate a higher-frequency wave, one must move the source (in this case, the tuning fork) faster. Therefore, to achieve the higher frequency produced by fork A, John would need to move it more quickly than fork B, which produces a lower frequency. Since more energy is required to generate higher-frequency waves, fork A, with the same amplitude as fork B, indeed has more energy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jaguars' Wembley trip just one more step on Blake Bortles' fantastic journey Blake Bortles wasn’t supposed to be starting for Jacksonville against the Dallas Cowboys at Wembley on Sunday. In fact, he wasn’t supposed to be anywhere near London at all. But then he wasn’t supposed to have been picked third in this year’s NFL draft, been MVP of the Fiesta Bowl against Baylor in January or even been playing for the University of Central Florida last year. Then again, he was passed over by every SEC university coming out of little Oviedo High School near Orlando in Florida, where he was a reluctant quarterback and the school was also initially hesitant to make him its centrepiece. In fact, the 22-year-old has rarely been the one who was supposed to do anything in particular at any point, yet he has always been “The One” once all the dust has settled. In that respect, he is a perfect fit for the Jaguars and, if both parties have the patience to endure the growing pains – the team are 1-8 for the season – the long-term prognosis is extremely positive. Just ask one of his former head coaches, George O’Leary at UCF. He says: “Blake is a kid who takes things in his stride, learning from everything as he goes. He is mature, has great poise and never gets unsettled. He has all the physical attributes you could want at 6ft 5in and maintains an even keel, never too high or too low.” O’Leary admits it took Bortles half of his sophomore year, having been a redshirt freshman, before he really “got it”, but then his growth curve was exponential, finishing his first full season as MVP of the 2012 Beef O’Brady’s Bowl against Ball State and going on to a stellar junior year highlighted by wins at Penn State, Louisville and Temple, an American Athletic Conference (AAC) championship and the big underdog moment of victory over Baylor in the Fiesta Bowl. It was a similar experience at Oviedo High, where a tall young linebacker was virtually press-ganged into service as a quarterback in his sophomore year, running a limited wing-T offence. When it was clear Bortles could handle a lot more than repeated hand-offs to a running back, the coach changed the system around him. By the time he finished his senior year, he had amassed a Seminole County record of 5,576 passing yards and 53 touchdowns. “He’s going to continue to try to get better at everything he does,” says Oviedo coach Wes Allen. “He’s not a kid who sits back and says ‘I’ve got it all. I’ve arrived.’ He’ll do everything in his power to make that franchise a better team. He’ll be the one who sits all night and studies the film and learns the protections and gets with the linemen and receivers. Blake has a great personality so people want to follow him, be around him, believe in him, not because he’s loud and boisterous, but because he puts in the work, and people see that. Bortles’ high school work did not attract a lot of attention. He visited seven SEC universities, but none were interested in an “unpolished” quarterback. Only UCF and Western Kentucky made full scholarship offers; Colorado State, Purdue and Tulane also wanted him, but as a tight end. “It just made him work harder,” says his dad, Rob Bortles. “He is a great competitor and the lack of recognition was just fuel for his competitive spirit. And he did everything on his own – if he felt he needed to work on something, he went out and did it himself. He initially had to compete with Jeff Godfrey for the starting role and even after UCF beat Ball State there was no conversation about what he might go on to do. Then he started his junior year and everything changed.” In the same way as his junior year at Oviedo High was the “learning experience” for a spectacular senior season, so his university sophomore year became the forerunner to a notable coming out party in the inaugural AAC campaign. Bortles threw for 3,581 yards and 25 touchdowns, running in another six and finishing with a 163.4 quarterback rating, while UCF chalked up a school record 12 wins and their highest ranking, No10. On the recommendation of several observers, Bortles petitioned the NFL for a draft “grade”, the system by which the professional ranks judge university talent and allow players to assess their potential worth. “It came back as a first-round grade,” recalls Rob. “It was the hardest decision he had to make because it would mean leaving a bunch of guys he had grown up with and he was worried about letting them down. “They were supposed to be the senior class together, ready to take UCF to another level, and Blake felt he owed it to them to stick together. But he had a first-round NFL grade. So I asked him how he would feel if somebody else on the team had the same opportunity he now had, and he said he’d tell them to go for it. So he did.” After Bortles declared for the draft, almost every team worked him out at the NFL Combine. He spent nearly eight weeks in Carlsbad, California, with veteran quarterback Jordan Palmer, working on his mechanics in a bid to add more polish to the “physical attributes” most pundits mentioned. In the quarterback class of 2014, he was initially listed behind Johnny Manziel and Teddy Bridgewater. But the more coaches talked to him, the more they liked what they heard. He didn’t carry a fancy moniker like “Johnny Football” or hail from a football-rich programme like Louisville, where Bridgewater was touted as a No1 pick. (He went 32nd, to the Vikings.) But Bortles’ even-keeled, can-do approach and sheer robustness began to change opinions as draft day approached. He, however, still had little clue where his future lay. His dad explains: “We had absolutely no idea what would happen at the draft. We were sat at one of the back tables in the green room, with the likes of Manziel and Jadeveon Clowney up front. Blake’s agent was talking to teams, trying to figure it out, but five minutes before the draft, Jacksonville were talking about going in another direction. “If that was the case, it was supposed to be Cleveland at No24. Clowney duly went No1 and then Greg Robinson was taken by the Rams – and Blake’s phone rang. I said to my wife, ‘What’s he on the phone for? Doesn’t he know someone might call?’ And she said, ‘Yes, it’s Jacksonville. He’s the No3 pick.’ Which just goes to show no-one really knows what’s going to happen. The players are all told ‘Hug your mum’ as the first thing after the phone call, but the cameras were still on Robinson when Blake hugged Suzy and me, and then his girlfriend, and Jordan Palmer, and by the time the cameras got to him, he was hugging his agent, and everyone just went ‘Why’s he hugging his agent first?’ It was a crazy period. From being “The Quarterback Who Wasn’t Supposed To Be Chosen First”, Bortles made the short journey up the Florida coast to find he was also “The Quarterback Who Wasn’t Supposed To Start In His First Season”. Jaguars head coach Gus Bradley was adamant his new acquisition should sit out his first season, another “redshirt year”. It would buck the trend of recent highly-drafted signal callers, the majority of whom have been required to justify their high salaries from day one, but it would potentially put Bortles on track to gain valuable experience without being right in the firing line. He put in a respectable preseason’s work and there was a predictable clamour to have him start straight away when Bradley named journeyman Chad Henne as his starting quarterback, but the Jacksonville strategy was clear – give Bortles a year to learn and he would be ready to fire on all cylinders in 2015. That plan lasted all of two and a half games. With the Jags down 30-0 at halftime to Indianapolis in their first home outing, Bradley sent the first-round pick out after the interval. A new era was born. Like his idol Brett Favre, Bortles was in at the deep end in his third game with his new team and, like the Green Bay legend, the story since has been a mix of touchdown passes (eight) and interceptions (13). Jacksonville remain painfully thin for experienced talent and the growing pains are evident in almost every direction. Bortles has been sacked 19 times, which puts him in the top 10 of most abused NFL quarterbacks, and he is on course to equal Peyton Manning’s debut season for interceptions (28). The Jaguars have been competitive in all but one of Bortles’ six starts, though, and it is now, in London this week and in the final third of the regular season, that we will see if he can repeat his successful learning curve from Oviedo High and UCF, and show if he is supposed to be on this stage. Rob Bortles has no doubts. The family dynamic is clearly a supportive one, cultivated through years of junior sports travel and competitiveness with younger brother Colby – “We don’t have a dining-room table,” says Rob, “We have a ping-pong table. Everything is a competition between those two, even to see who can finish dinner first!” Between them, Rob and Suzy drove the boys thousands of miles around the south-east for football or baseball, and they all thrived on their sporting instincts. Rob was also a noted high school linebacker and wrestler while Suzy played softball. Rose-coloured glasses are not part of the family accoutrements, though, and therefore Rob believes his son’s basic character traits, which served him so well through high school and college, will surface again. No-one will out-work Blake. It is his passion and has been his dream since he was a kid. I know he is up at 5.30 some mornings to get in to practice. We call him ‘The Grinder’ – he just keeps working at something until he cracks it. “Yes, he’s going to throw his share of interceptions but a lot of those are correctable as he learns from his mistakes, and he has a great coaching set-up at Jacksonville. Everyone is unfailingly positive and they all buy into that ethos. Despite the losses this season, everyone remains focused on the plan and they have so much young talent, that, if they do all stick it out together, they have a great future.” If that is the view from the outside – albeit from an insider on the outside – it makes sense to test the temperature on the inside, too, via Bortles himself. Twenty-two is still young in the NFL – the only younger starting quarterback is Minnesota’s Bridgewater, at 21 – but to talk to Bortles is to listen to a vastly more mature, tuned-in personality, at once aware of his own shortcomings to date but unfazed by the task ahead, equable yet determined. He says: “Obviously there have been a lot of mistakes and a lot of learning opportunities, and it takes time to recognise that everybody is a lot faster on defence, but so are the guys you are throwing to, so I feel the learning curve balances out. It is up to me to get the offence in the right position and move the ball consistently, and we have been able to do that really well these past couple of weeks, although we’ve also had some breakdowns that have cost us points. As long as you learn from them, the experience isn’t wasted. It is also cool to be going through this learning process as a group and, while we have a good mix, with some older guys who are all leaders, we do have a bunch of young guys who are starting in their rookie or second year and going through this together. The results are not what we want but we are getting better and you couldn’t want for a more enjoyable environment than Jacksonville. OK, so there may be a touch of youthful naivety in that last statement – not many players would list north-east Florida among their top places to be – but ultimately, it is no wonder Bradley pulled the plug on Plan A and went to Plan Bortles after only three games. While comparisons to Favre and Buffalo’s Jim Kelly abound, the kid from Oviedo is a true individual who inspires with deeds not words, who takes the team ethic to heart and buys in completely to the “learn and improve” approach. It will certainly be in evidence at Wembley on Sunday, when the contrast with the ego-driven Cowboys will be palpable. Bortles and the Jaguars aren’t supposed to win, you know, but then he’s been hearing that for much of his young life. It hasn’t stopped him yet.

This meets the criteria of being a list of numbers as all elements within the square brackets are numerical and separated by commas. Part #2: Identifying even numbers Usage: Once the list is provided, the task requires identification of even numbers. These are numbers divisible by 2. For example, from the input list, 186, 36, 28, 194, 152, 192 are all even numbers as they can be divided by 2 with no remainder. Part #3: Removing even numbers Usage: After identifying even numbers, you need to remove them from the list. After removing 186, 36, 28, 194, 152, 192 from the original list, the list would look like this: [173, 9, 123, 29]. This meets the criteria because my new list only contains Odd numbers. Part #4: Handling lists with all even numbers Usage: In situations where every number in the list is even, this task requires returning an empty list. For instance, if the input list was [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], following the instructions will yield an empty list: []. This meets the criteria as all the numbers in the original list were even, and thus were all removed. Part #5: Categorizing zero as an even number Usage: In this task, zero is categorized as an even number, and therefore should be removed from the list if included. For example, if the original list were [0, 1, 3, 5], after removing the even number (0 in this case), the list would be [1, 3, 5].

Question: Information: - A recumbent bicycle is a bicycle that places the rider in a laid-back reclining position. Most recumbent riders choose this type of design for ergonomic reasons; the rider's weight is distributed comfortably over a larger area, supported by back and buttocks. On a traditional upright bicycle, the body weight rests entirely on a small portion of the sitting bones, the feet, and the hands. - The land speed record (or absolute land speed record) is the highest speed achieved by a person using a vehicle on land. There is no single body for validation and regulation; in practice the Category C (\\"Special Vehicles\\") flying start regulations are used, officiated by regional or national organizations under the auspices of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile. The land speed record (LSR) is standardized as the speed over a course of fixed length, averaged over two runs (commonly called \\"passes\\"). Two runs are required in opposite directions within one hour, and a new record mark must exceed the previous one by at least one percent to be validated. There are numerous other class records for cars; motorcycles fall into a separate class. - The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA, English: International Automobile Federation) is an association established as the \\"Association Internationale des Automobile Clubs Reconnus\\" (AIACR, English: 'International Association of Recognized Automobile Clubs') on 20 June 1904 to represent the interests of motoring organisations and motor car users. To the general public, the FIA is mostly known as the governing body for many auto racing events. The FIA also promotes road safety around the world. - The JCB Dieselmax is a diesel - engined ' streamliner ' car designed for the purpose of breaking the land speed record for a diesel - engined vehicle . The car was built for JCB , a British multinational equipment company . As of 2014 , the car holds the world diesel - powered land speed record , having been driven to over 350 miles per hour ( 560 km / h ) by Wing Commander Andy Green in 2006 . - Streamline Moderne, or Art Moderne, is a late type of the Art Deco architecture and design that emerged in the 1930s. Its architectural style emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements. - A streamliner is a vehicle incorporating streamlining in a shape providing reduced air resistance. The term is applied to high-speed railway trainsets of the 1930s to 1950s, and to their successor \\"bullet trains\\". Less commonly, the term is applied to fully faired recumbent bicycles. As part of the Streamline Moderne trend, the term was applied to passenger cars, trucks, and other types of light-, medium-, or heavy-duty vehicles, but now vehicle streamlining is so prevalent that it is not an outstanding characteristic. In land speed racing, it is a term applied to the long, slender, custom built, high-speed vehicles with enclosed wheels. - High-speed rail is a type of rail transport that operates significantly faster than traditional rail traffic, using an integrated system of specialized rolling stock and dedicated tracks. While there is no single standard that applies worldwide, new lines in excess of and existing lines in excess of are widely considered to be high-speed, with some extending the definition to include lower speeds in areas for which these speeds still represent significant improvements. The first such system began operations in Japan in 1964 and was widely known as the bullet train. High-speed trains normally operate on standard gauge tracks of continuously welded rail on grade-separated right-of-way that incorporates a large turning radius in its design.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. News article: CBC.ca - Arts - Film - End of an Era What were we talking about?: Todd Jackson (Ralph Fiennes) and Sofia (Natasha Richardson) in The White Countess. Courtesy Mongrel Media. Over the last 44 years, director James Ivory and his recently deceased life partner, producer Ismail Merchant, built one of the most recognizable brands in modern cinema. Their newest and final collaboration, The White Countess, concerns a blind American (Ralph Fiennes) and a Russian aristocrat (Natasha Richardson, never better, never more radiant) who open a nightclub amid the turbulence of 1930s Shanghai. Merchant Ivoryâs valedictory effort shows off their usual strengths: the film is pretty to look at and employs top British actors in all the key roles. The White Countess is as good a picture as the couple has produced in years; nonetheless, it marks the end of a franchise that was better at atmosphere than it was at storytelling, better at producing a marketable type of beauty than competent films. Merchant was born in Bombay, Ivory hailed from Berkeley, Calif.; both shared an acute case of anglophilia, distilling a nostalgic vision of Englishness. Merchant and Ivory began making art-house films in the U.K. in the early 1960s and broke through in North America in 1985, with A Room with a View; based on the novel by E.M. Forster, it told the story of a young English gentlewoman (Helena Bonham Carter) whose passions are unleashed by a trip to Italy. Merchant Ivoryâs depiction of England was one of sun-soaked barley fields and ancient oak trees, bespectacled literary fops wearing bespoke suits (Daniel Day-Lewis in Room) and intrepid spinster travellers in free-flowing skirts and high-collared blouses (Judi Dench in Room). This hoary vision annoyed many Britons, while enchanting North Americans. Merchant Ivory hired many young, talented English actors, many of whom have gone on to busy international careers (most notably Day-Lewis, Bonham Carter, Hugh Grant and Rupert Graves). Merchant and Ivory chose to depict pre-First World War Britain so glowingly because they loathed what the country has become. âEngland has been inherited by the lower classes who talk about making money and football,â Merchant once told Londonâs Sunday Telegraph. âAn Englishman's word is no longer his bond.â Where the grass is always greener: From left, George Emerson (Julian Sands), Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Lucy Honeychurch (Helen Bonham Carter) in Room with a View. Courtesy Warner Home Video. In the final analysis, Merchant and Ivory are the Crabtree & Evelyn of filmmaking. Liking Merchant Ivory films has become akin to enjoying tennis or classical music. Never mind that you havenât seen a Merchant Ivory film — or watched an entire tennis match or sat through a symphony — in years; you identified yourself long ago as the sort of person who likes Merchant Ivory movies, and youâre sticking to it. Despite having produced only a handful of decent films (and many barking dogs), the duo succeeded in making their double-barrelled name a latter-day shibboleth. Fans are part of an international tribe of like-minded individuals: well-educated, sensitive and, more than anything else, upper crust (or, at least, aspiring to be upper crust). âDo you like Merchant Ivory?â has become a question much like Aimez-vous Brahms? — a reference to a FranÃ§oise Sagan novel that wonât be wasted on Merchant Ivory lovers. Their films usually have plots that float about aimlessly and dialogue that rings false and pretentious. (Much of the blame for this rests with Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who wrote the scripts for 23 of the films.) Although the movies are informed by an effortless cultural sophistication, they lack a parallel political sophistication and get downright clumsy whenever they try to approach public issues. Merchant Ivory productions attempt to escape from the hurly-burly; they are about waking up from the nightmare of history, rather than engaging with it. Case in point: the execrable (and typical) Jefferson in Paris (1995). Thomas Jefferson (Nick Nolte) comes to Paris as the American ambassador and promptly falls for an artsy Englishwoman (Greta Scacchi). As the affair gains steam, so does the revolutionary movement. The filmmakers drop in a few hilariously decorous riots here and there, between aristocratic soirÃ©es, but they are made to seem beside the point. (Commoners don't get much screen time in Merchant Ivory flicks.) Meanwhile, Nolte and Scacchi, a pair of accomplished acting pros, gamely wade through spectacularly wooden dialogue: He: âYou appear all clarity and light, of this world, not the next.â She: âIt is true I was born in the sun and I can't live without it.â Enter Thandie Newton, as Jeffersonâs slave, Sally Hemmings, who has to play at once a budding heroine of the freedom movement and an insipid, yessuh-Massah housegirl. As the film goes on, Sally gradually supplants the Englishwoman in her masterâs affections. Revolving wildly around this love triangle are Jefferson's intolerant daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow, more lumpen than usual), who may convert to Catholicism; Marie-Antoinette, playing at being a dairy maid; a hypnotist who puts hysterical courtiers under; and Monsieur Guillotin, who demonstrates a model of his decapitation device at a dinner party. Big wigs: Richard Cosway (Simon Callow) and Maria Cosway (Greta Scacchi) in Jefferson in Paris. Courtesy Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. In short, the film is a mess. The characters are incoherent. One moment, Jefferson is a sneaky sex-hound, the next a high-minded idealist; he never feels at all human. The projectâs politics are muddled: Jeffersonâs views on slavery are even more confused than the historical record reveals. Plus, the filmmakers donât even let Greta Scacchi have a ripped-bodice sex scene, which is like giving Pavarotti a non-singing part. Merchant and Ivory did, however, bring certain second-tier strengths to all their work: an impressionist's visual sensibility, a fashion historianâs love of period finery and a real appreciation of literary classics written in the understated Edwardian vein. Their best films â The Forster trio of A Room With a View, Maurice (1987) and Howards End (1992), as well as the neo-Edwardian The Remains of the Day (1993) — provoke a sort of restful ease, the aah of coming into an art gallery, which is rare enough to be welcome. Right from the credit sequences in these films, we feel that we are in a civilized space; not even Greta Scacchi would dare disrobe here. These films all dramatize the struggle to overcome repression, to come out (as whatever you are). In the 1980s and early 1990s, these period pieces spoke to a society at the tail end of the battle against repression. In their subtle way, the films contributed to this last great push for freer self-expression, which largely accounts for their popularity among suburban bohemians. Twenty years later, with everyone out (as whatever they are), the message seems quaint and irrelevant. Weâve jettisoned our repressed upbringings; now what? The films end where our real lives now begin. Perhaps Merchant Ivoryâs greatest contribution has been recognizing and championing literary talent. But if their book picks are generally first rate, theyâve often failed to translate good novels into quality films. The Forster books, as well as Kazuo Ishiguroâs The Remains of the Day, were easy adaptations: both writers pen naturalistic, evocative dialogue and situate their characters in picturesque locales. The franchise invariably made a hash of harder-to-transmute works, utterly squelching the bright airiness of Diane Johnsonâs comedy of manners, Le Divorce (2003), and getting lost in Henry Jamesâs labyrinthine prose in The Bostonians (1984) and The Golden Bowl (2000). Thankfully, the script for The White Countess comes from Ishiguro, one of the most disciplined writers at work today. (He based the story very loosely on Junichiro Tanizakiâs novel The Diary of a Mad Old Man, as well as his own grandfatherâs stories of 1930s Shanghai.) The American diplomat played by Fiennes loses his family and his eyesight in a terrorist attack. Understandably embittered, he leaves affairs of state behind to open the nightclub the White Countess, which, like a Merchant Ivory film, offers a getaway from the rough-and-tumble world outside. At one point in the film, the well-dressed, distinguished American sits on a barstool, sighing reflectively. âOut there,â he says, âthere is chaos, mistrust, deceit.â This is an economical description of the raw materials of real drama. Sadly, Merchant Ivoryâs films never could deal with such messy stuff. In the movie, the nightclub has a good run, but must close when the Japanese invade the city. The White Countess is certainly a stylish place to hang out, but, in a real crisis, it shuts down. It doesnât serve up the good, stiff drink you need.

Context: As his days in office wane, U.S. President Barack Obama is pushing to commute sentences of non-violent drug offenders convicted under what the White House called \\"outdated and unduly harsh\\" sentencing laws. It has become the centerpiece of his effort to reform the country’s criminal-justice system, which has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Part 1: Arturo XuncaxThe first part takes place in a small rural Guatemalan village called San Pedro and introduces the Xuncax family, a group of indigenous Mayans. Arturo is a coffee picker and his wife a homemaker. Arturo explains to his son, Enrique, his world view and how the indio fares in Guatemalan life, noting that, \\"to the rich, the peasant is just a pair of strong arms\\". Arturo and his family then discuss the possibility of going to the United States where \\"all the people, even the poor, own their own cars\\". Because of his attempts to form a labor union among the workers, Arturo and the other organizers are attacked and murdered by government troops when a co-worker is bribed to betray them... Arturo's severed head is seen hanging from a tree. When Enrique attempts to climb the tree that displays his father's head, a soldier attacks him. Enrique fights and kills the attacker, only to learn that many of their fellow villagers have been rounded up by soldiers. The children's mother too \\"disappears\\": abducted by soldiers. So, using money given to them by their godmother, Enrique and his sister Rosa decide to flee Guatemala, the land of their birth, and head north.Part 2: CoyoteDuring the second part of the film the two teenagers flee Guatemala, travel through Mexico, and meet a Mexican coyote who guides them across the border.

Today, he is studying about reptiles and amphibians. He found it easy to understand their differences by categorizing them. For that, he classified reptiles as class A and amphibians as class B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which class of animals would have better separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams, class A or class B? Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Answer:","completion":"Class A animals, which comprise reptiles, would have better separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. This is due to the fact that reptiles have a more developed septum in their heart, which more effectively separates the two types of bloodstreams compared to amphibians. This adaptation allows for a more efficient respiratory system and helps reptiles better draw air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now Movie plot: Set in the turn of the 20th century, the film focuses on Joseph E. Howard, an aspiring songwriter who happily sells a song to performer Lulu Madison, who later takes sole credit for the writing. He angrily confronts her, but she distracts him by seducing him in her hotel suite. Thinking that she can use Joe's talent for her career, she invites him to serve as her personal piano player on her tour. He accepts her invitation and bids farewell to Katie, the young niece of his guardian John McCullem who reluctantly says goodbye. Over the following period, Joe grows to become a successful songwriter. Katie follows him to Philadelphia and joins the tour by lying, saying that her uncle has died. Katie's presence distracts Joe, much to Lulu's anger and jealousy. Although Lulu makes sure it obvious to Katie she is not happy about her presence, Katie remains unaffected and continues supporting Joe in his career, rather than working for Lulu. One evening, Lulu tries to cancel Joe's performance, and Katie responds by ruining Lulu's costume, thus making it possible for Joe to perform his latest song, which is received with wild applause. After being fired by Lulu, Joe and Katie form their own group, working for producers Karl and Kassel. However, Joe is later seduced by attractive performer Fritzi Barrington to work for her. They are successful, but their collaboration proves short-lived, as Fritzi's financial supporter, a flame from the past, is jealous of Joe's connection to her and withdraws. Joe and Fritzi are able to perform a show, though, and it proves to be a major success. They eventually make their debut on Broadway and work together for a while, until Fritzi retires to marry Martin Webb. Joe, feeling betrayed, blames Katie for scaring away Fritzi, as Katie is her understudy in the show. Sometime later, Joe finds out Katie is working under the stage name Pat O'Dare, performing 'I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now', an unpublished song by Joe. Katie is surprised to see him, and they eventually kiss each other.

At its peak, the empire included significant portions of Southeast Europe, Western Asia, and North Africa. The heart of the Ottoman Empire was located in modern-day Turkey. Its capital city was originally Bursa before it was moved to Edirne (formerly known as Adrianople) and later to Istanbul (formerly known as Constantinople/Byzantium), which served as the empire's capital from 1453 until its dissolution in 1922.

Moreso, \\"the futility of revenge\\" is one of my favorite themes in film. Having seen Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2002), I was expecting an even more relevant expression of this theme. Instead, this film is a weak half-hearted attempt which expressed nothing but the film's lack of conviction and focus. *SPOILERS* The end scene, a gratuitous male-on-male rape/torture scene, came across as nothing less than a female revenge rape fantasy. However, the film doesn't even follow through with this. Instead, the drawn out scene (which FAR exceeds the brutality of the initial rape both in the degree to which it was graphic and to which it was ritualized) is crowned with a shot of Dawson's face in an expression of either regret or \\"This didn't fix anything\\" while the rape of her rapist is heard continuing in the background. My problem with the scene wasn't one of shock, but one of confusion as to what such a graphic scene was trying to get across to the audience. I mean, do we feel bad for the rapist? Do we rejoice in Dawson's revenge? Are we disgusted by the brutality of it all? Do we feel Dawson's moment of regretful clarity?

Article: When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could. I stood there deep in thought. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But I think that it's time to change my prayer because now I know my children are going to encounter hardship.

How do you do this: To score a strike in bowling,","completion":"Scoring a strike in bowling requires a combination of skill, technique, and understanding of the game's rules and scoring system. A strike is achieved when a bowler successfully knocks down all ten pins with the first ball of a frame (the first of two opportunities in each turn). Here is a step-by-step guide to help you score a strike in bowling: 1. Choose the right ball: Find a suitable bowling ball that fits your hand comfortably and provides a good grip. The holes should be neither too tight nor too loose. The ideal weight of the ball will depend on your strength and comfort level but typically ranges between 10-16 pounds for adults. 2. Develop a consistent approach: Establish a consistent starting position on the approach area (the part of the lane where you take your steps before releasing the ball), usually about 4-5 steps away from the foul line (the line you must not cross when releasing the ball). Most bowlers use a four or five-step approach, but it ultimately depends on what feels most comfortable and natural for you. 3. Visualize your target: Before starting your approach, look down the lane and visualize your target. In bowling, the pins are numbered, and you may want to aim for the space between the 1st (headpin) and either the 2nd or 3rd pin, commonly referred to as the pocket. Hitting the pocket increases the chances of scoring a strike. 4. Proper footwork and timing: As you begin your approach, your footwork should be smooth and well-timed. Focus on maintaining a good balance and rhythm throughout the steps leading up to the release. The penultimate step is called the slide, where the bowler glides up to the foul line to release the ball smoothly. 5. Develop a consistent swing: Your arm swing should be consistent and fluid. Keep your arm close to your body throughout the swing, and allow the bowling ball's weight to guide the motion. To generate the proper backswing, let the ball swing back naturally instead of muscling it back or lifting it. As you transition into your downswing, maintain a free and relaxed arm motion that leads to a smooth release. 6. Release and follow-through: As you reach the foul line, release the ball by allowing your fingers to exit the ball first, followed by your thumb. Make sure you maintain good balance and control over your hand position, as this will affect the ball's spin and trajectory. A proper follow-through is crucial to ensuring the ball travels in the intended direction. Extend your arm and fingers towards your target and hold the position for a moment to boost accuracy. 7. Analyze and adjust: Even professional bowlers don't achieve strikes every time, so it's essential to learn from each throw and make the necessary adjustments. If your ball consistently misses the pocket or leaves pins standing, consider adjusting your starting position, target, speed, or spin as necessary. Practicing frequently will help improve your skills and increase your chances of scoring strikes consistently. Remember that achieving a strike is only one part of the overall game of bowling. To become a proficient bowler, focus on developing a consistent approach, swing, and release, while also learning about the game's rules, scoring system, and various strategies for adjusting to different lane conditions and situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Players: This option doesn't make sense because players are the ones who participate in the game and are not the place where football games occur. 3. High school: While high school football games can attract a significant number of attendees, it is unlikely that there would be over a hundred thousand people in attendance at a high school football game. 4. Texas: This option is not logical because Texas is a state, not a specific location like a football field. 5. Oklahoma: Similar to Texas, this option is not relevant as Oklahoma is a state and the given context does not specify a location within the state. After a step-by-step analysis, I believe the correct choice is \\"college campus\\" because it is the most appropriate and relevant answer based on the given context.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A week or 2 before the first freeze of the season, cover your planted peonies with mulch. You can use a commercial mulch if you’d like, but weeds, straw, pine needles, sawdust and grass will work just fine. Cover each of your planting sites with a 4–6 in (10–15 cm) layer of your preferred mulching material. While peonies certainly need cold weather to grow, you don’t want the roots themselves to freeze too quickly or for too long. Mulching the soil insulates it and ensures that the soil won’t freeze and thaw repeatedly through the season. Most peonies need around 400-hours of exposure of near-freezing temperatures in the winter to bloom completely in the summer. You do not need to mulch peonies that you’re storing indoors. Indoor peonies do not require as many freezing hours, since their root systems won’t get that big anyway. Keep your pot near a chilly window during the winter months. As spring starts, wait for the temperature to consistently rise above 32 °F (0 °C). Once it has been above freezing for a few weeks, remove the mulch from your plant. Use a shovel or throw on some thick gloves and scrape it off the top of the soil. If you accidentally scrape away some of the top soil, go ahead and replace it. Get a fertilizer that is low in nitrogen from your local gardening store. As spring progresses, you’ll soon notice stems sticking out of the ground. When the stems get to be around 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) high, sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons (15-20 g) of fertilizer into the soil and mix it with your top soil by hand or with a trowel. You may not see any stems emerge from the soil for the first 1-2 years. Over the course of the first 2 years, you may not notice much progress with your peonies. Peonies can live over 25 years, but they take a while to get going. During the first 2 years, water your plants every other week to ensure that the soil retains moisture and the roots get some water. Apply a soft stream of water to the top soil for 5-6 seconds when you go to water the rest of your garden. You do not need to water your peonies in the winter. You can water less frequently once stems begin to grow. If your flower is going to bloom on a given year, you’ll notice the stems in early-to-mid spring. Once you notice your flowers growing, water them once every 3-4 weeks. Peonies are pretty easy to care for after the first few years, and it’s particularly hard to starve them of water since their root systems are so efficient. Give them a few seconds of water by spraying around the stem of the plant once your peonies have grown. Peonies typically bloom around April or May. The blooms may only last a few weeks, but they’ll be back next year! Once your plants start to wither, you need to trim them down to avoid starving the roots. Grab a set of garden shears a week before the first freeze of the winter season. Cut your flowers down until there are only 3 inches (7.6 cm) of stem remaining near the soil. Mulch the soil and repeat the process to ensure that your flowers come back next year. You can prune your plant to remove dead bulbs if you’d like, but peonies typically don’t require much (if any) pruning. The biggest predators when it comes to peonies are blight, rot, and fungus. If you ever notice discolored fungus or dark rot setting into your plants, trim them down to the topsoil and discard the damaged portions of each plant. Wait for a year to allow the winter frost to kill any remnants of the disease. Peonies tend to be very resilient when it comes to insects and illness. If you ever have a year where your plants seem sickly, the winter will freeze away most of the common offenders and your plants will grow back beautifully next year. You may notice ants feeding on the flowers when they bloom. Don’t worry about the ants, they can’t permanently damage the plant and won’t cause very much trouble—they’re only there for the secretions that come out of the flowers.","completion":"The article provides detailed instructions on how to properly care for peonies, including mulching, fertilizing, watering, and pruning techniques, as well as addressing potential issues with diseases and pests to ensure healthy growth and beautiful blooms each year."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

He is unofficially called the Father of the Nation. - Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi (Nehru; 19 November 1917 31 October 1984) was an Indian politician and central figure of the Indian National Congress party, and to date the only female Prime Minister of India. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India after her father. Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964. She was elected Congress President in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964, Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by Lal Bahadur Shastri. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966, upon the death of Shastri, she defeated her rival, Morarji Desai, to become leader, and thus succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India. - Jawaharlal Nehru (14 November 1889 27 May 1964) was the first Prime Minister of India and a central figure in Indian politics before and after independence.

He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income.

Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble.

During the Allied occupation of Germany after World War II, internal borders were redrawn by the Allied military governments. No single state comprised more than 30% of either population or territory; this was intended to prevent any one state from being as dominant within Germany as Prussia had been in the past. Initially, only seven of the pre-War states remained: Baden (in part), Bavaria (reduced in size), Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse (enlarged), Saxony, and Thuringia. The states with hyphenated names, such as Rhineland-Palatinate, North Rhine-Westphalia, and Saxony-Anhalt, owed their existence to the occupation powers and were created out of mergers of former Prussian provinces and smaller states. Former German territory that lie east of the Oder-Neisse Line fell under either Polish or Soviet administration but attempts were made at least symbolically not to abandon sovereignty well into the 1960s. However, no attempts were made to establish new states in these territories as they lay outside the jurisdiction of West Germany at that time. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who redrew internal borders after WW I?","completion":"The redrawing of internal borders after World War I was largely done by the victorious Allied powers, particularly during the negotiations in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. The Treaty of Versailles and other treaties established new borders and created several new states, primarily from territories taken from the defeated nations of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. The major powers involved in redrawing borders included the United States, Britain, France, and Italy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"Remy, like many individuals who leave their rural homes for urban settings, could have made this decision due to a multitude of reasons. While I cannot speak for Remy's specific motivations without more context, I will provide a detailed list of potential factors that might have influenced his decision to move to the city. 1. Job opportunities: The city often offers more job opportunities and a wider range of industries compared to rural areas. Remy may have been seeking better employment prospects or career advancements that were unavailable on the farm. Urban settings also create a strong network of professionals, leading to greater collaboration and innovation opportunities. 2. Education: Access to higher education institutions is typically easier in cities, as they host several universities and vocational schools. If Remy was looking to pursue further studies or gain additional qualifications, moving closer to these establishments could have been an attractive incentive. 3. Better infrastructure and public services: In terms of transportation, healthcare, and municipal services, cities typically have better-funded and more comprehensive offerings. Remy may have been drawn to more reliable public transportation options, improved access to healthcare facilities, or the availability of various public programs and amenities. 4. Cultural attractions and entertainment: Cities often boast a rich array of cultural institutions, such as museums, theaters, and galleries. Additionally, the endless variety of restaurants, bars, clubs, and other entertainment venues can provide residents with numerous social opportunities and experiences. It is possible that Remy was seeking a more vibrant and engaging social life. 5. Diversity and cosmopolitanism: Cities attract residents from various backgrounds, forming multicultural and cosmopolitan communities. For someone like Remy who lived on a farm, the allure of meeting new people and learning about different cultures might have been a strong incentive to move. 6. Independence and personal growth: Leaving the familiarity of a rural environment and immersing oneself in an urban setting can provide opportunities for personal growth and self-discovery. Remy might have felt a strong desire to challenge himself and expand his horizons. 7. Fatigue from farm life: As you mentioned, Remy was tired of all the work on the farm. Farming involves long hours of hard, physical labor and can be both mentally and physically exhausting. Remy may have been seeking a change of pace and respite from the demands of farm work. 8. Family or social influence: Remy might have been influenced by friends, family, or loved ones who encouraged him to move to the city. Hearing about the experiences of others who have made a similar transition can often be a motivating factor. In summary, there are several factors that could have influenced Remy's decision to move to the city, such as better job opportunities, education, modern infrastructure, cultural attractions, diversity, personal growth, exhaustion from farm work, or the encouragement of family and friends. It is likely that a combination of these elements played a role in shaping Remy's choice to leave the farm behind and seek a new life in the city."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: catch cold, feel lonely, enter college, graduate from high school, finish junior high Why is \\"graduate from high school\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Graduate from high school\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is an educational milestone that typically occurs immediately before entering tertiary education. In many countries, secondary education, which includes high school, is the final stage of compulsory education. After completing high school, students receive their diploma or certificate, signifying that they have fulfilled the requirements of secondary education. Tertiary education, also known as higher education, is the educational level that follows the completion of high school. It includes various forms of study beyond high school, such as college, university, vocational training, and professional courses. Therefore, graduating from high school is a prerequisite for most students before pursuing tertiary education. Comparatively, the other possible answers (catch cold, feel lonely, enter college, finish junior high) are not specifically related to the general progression from secondary to tertiary education: 1. \\"Catch cold\\" and \\"feel lonely\\" are unrelated to educational milestones and can happen to a person at any stage in their life. 2. \\"Enter college\\" refers to an action that typically occurs after graduating from high school and starting tertiary education, not before. 3. \\"Finish junior high\\" is relevant to education, but it represents an earlier stage of schooling than high school graduation.

As he finishes reading the script, he gets a twinkle in his eye, believing that he's found the perfect movie moment. The next day he gathers his staff and actors and tells them about the brilliant script called \\"Chubby Rain\\" that was written by his very own accountant Afrim. They then figure that this is their only shot at making a movie. So Bobby gets out his life savings - some 2200, and they start getting the equipment and the crew that they need to make the movie.Bobby then goes to meet executive agent Jerry Renfro at a chic Hollywood restaurant. He slips the maitre d' 20 and asks to be seated at the table next to Renfro. As he pretends to be an elite movie producer and fakes his way into having a conversation with Renfro about the script for Chubby Rain. He hands the script to Renfro and he reads through it, eventually agreeing with Bobby about the script's final moment which has the hero screaming \\"Gotcha suckers!!\\" that that is a great catch phrase. Bobby tells Jerry about the plans to get Kit Ramsey in the film's lead role. He then agrees that if Bobby gets Kit Ramsey, they've got a go picture.In Kit's mansion, he is unloading at his agent, telling him about how there's no good Hollywood moments and no good catchphrases anymore, that it's all style and no substance. The agent tries to tell him that the script he's just read is good and this movie has that moment, but it's not the moment that Kit is looking for. Kit then heads to his weekly appointment at Mindhead, a psychological collective that has obtained cult-like status among the Hollywood elite. Bobby has managed to sneak past the gate and heads to talk to Kit, now pretending to be a script delivery guy for a major Hollywood agent.

I mean, I am his brother,\\" is not explicitly mentioned. However, Bobby Bowfinger, played by Steve Martin, has great faith in his accountant Afrim's talent as a screenwriter, despite the fact that they are not related in any way. He is convinced that Afrim's script \\"Chubby Rain\\" could be a huge success and is willing to invest his life savings into making the film. Bowfinger aims to cast the famous actor Kit Ramsey, played by Eddie Murphy, in the lead role, but faces challenges in convincing him to join the project. Regarding your decision to invest in this film proposal, you should consider the following factors: 1. The script's quality and potential to be a hit: Bobby Bowfinger is convinced that the script for \\"Chubby Rain\\" is outstanding and has the potential to be very successful. However, you need to carefully read the script and assess its quality and plot coherence to make an informed decision. 2. The cast and crew's talent and experience: In the film, Bowfinger's team is inexperienced and has limited resources. Make sure to research the actors and crew members involved in the proposal to evaluate their skills and past work. If they have a good track record and possess great potential, your investment could yield positive returns. 3. The target audience and marketability: \\"Bowfinger\\" is a comedy that satirizes the Hollywood film production process. Before investing, consider whether this genre and theme will be appealing to a wide enough audience and generate sufficient interest in the target demographic. 4. Production budget and realistic expectations: Bowfinger starts the production of \\"Chubby Rain\\" with a budget of just 2,200, which is significantly lower than the budgets of most successful Hollywood movies. Analyze the budget proposal and make sure it includes a reasonable allocation for all the necessary expenses, including those related to talent, marketing, and distribution. 5. The involvement of a prominent actor: Securing Kit Ramsey's participation in \\"Chubby Rain\\" is a pivotal factor in the film's success within the plot of \\"Bowfinger.\\" In reality, having a famous actor attached to a project can significantly increase its chances of success, but you will still need a strong overall package, including a well-written script, capable director, and efficient production team. In conclusion, to decide your investment in the film proposal, carefully weigh the various factors, including the script's quality, the talents and experience of the cast and crew, the target audience and marketability of the film, the proposed production budget, and any involvement of prominent actors. Research and evaluate each aspect thoroughly before making your final decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again.

This cartoon is short on plot, but is a visually stunning piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers: This short has a \\"story\\" that's incredibly slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. The visuals are exceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty and there's some incredibly inspired work here. My favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track makes it seem as though the row is a pipe organ. The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly well executed. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but they probably also helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably went over budget and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more conscious of cost than Harman and Ising were.

However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him 8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes.

However, it's crucial to ensure that the remaining letters after extracting a word also form valid words. Hence, the segmentation needs to proceed in a thoughtful order rather than simply extracting words as they are spotted. Step 1: -The very first word that can be easily recognized is 'The', a common English word that often starts sentences. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watchismadeofstainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 2: -The next easily recognizable word is 'watch', a common English noun. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'ismadeofstainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 3: -After 'watch', 'is', a very common English verb can be separated out. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'madeofstainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 4: -Next, 'made' can be segmented out, another common English word which is part of the verb 'is made'. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'ofstainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 5: -I can then take out 'of', a simple English preposition. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainlesssteelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 6: -Next, 'stainless', an English adjective can be segmented out. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainless' + 'steelwithsapphirecrystal'. Step 7: -Then, 'steel', a common English noun can be separated. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainless' + 'steel' + 'withsapphirecrystal'. Step 8: -Next, 'with', another English preposition can be separated. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainless' + 'steel' + 'with' + 'sapphirecrystal'. Step 9: -Then, 'sapphire' can be segmented out. Segmented string: 'The' + 'watch' + 'is' + 'made' + 'of' + 'stainless' + 'steel' + 'with' + 'sapphire' + 'crystal'.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A firm handshake could be a sign of a longer life expectancy , according to British researchers. Scientists at the Medical Research Council found that elderly people who could still give a firm handshake and walk at a quick pace were likely to outlive their slower peers. They found simple measures of physical capability like shaking hands, walking, getting up from a chair and balancing on one leg were related to the life expectancy, even after accounting for age, sex and body size. The study is the first to provide a comprehensive view of the existing data from 33 studies. \\"These measures have been used in population-based research for quite a long time,\\" said Rachel Cooper of the Medical Research Council's Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging. \\"They may be useful indicators for subsequent health.\\" Cooper, whose study appears in the British Medical Journal, said more studies are needed to clarify whether the measures would be helpful to doctors as a screening tool. \\"I wouldn't suggest that we roll them out into clinical practice tomorrow, but it is possible that they could be used in the future,\\" she told the media. The researchers examined 33 studies involving tens of thousands of people, most of whom were aged over 60 but living in the community rather than in hospital or care homes. The researchers found that those with the strongest hand grasps tended to live longer than those with weak grips. The death rate over the period of the studies for people with weak handshakes was 67 percent higher than for people with a firm grip. The slowest walkers were nearly three times more likely to die during the study period than swifter walkers. The people who were slowest to get up from a chair had about double the death rate compared to the quick risers. \\"Those people in the general population who have higher physical capability levels are likely to live longer,\\" Cooper said.

In the first sentence, \\"However, it was a legal ceremony and not a spiritual one,\\" the use of \\"and\\" helps to contrast the two types of ceremonies – legal and spiritual – by presenting them as two separate entities. In the second sentence, \\"However, it was a legal, and not a spiritual ceremony,\\" the use of a comma before \\"and not\\" gives the sentence a slightly different structure. Regardless of the structure, the point being made stays the same – that the event being discussed holds legal significance rather than any spiritual meaning. In summary, both of these sentences effectively communicate the same message, albeit with slight differences in punctuation and structure. The overall meaning, which contrasts a legal ceremony with a spiritual one, is maintained in both sentences."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Adam Sobel channels Italian-American roots for new Mina Test Kitchen incarnation, Little Italy Mina Test Kitchen Photo: Kevin McCullough For Middle’terranea, the first incarnation of two-month-old Mina Test Kitchen, Michael Mina found culinary inspiration in his Egyptian heritage, while chef Adam Sobel channeled his Jewish roots. While the temporary pop-up restaurant experiment was very well received, it was expected to be short-lived, and we now have an end-date: Not to fret, just a week later, Saturday, October 31st, the Test Kitchen will launch its new concept: Little Italy. This time, Sobel will focus on his Italian American family ties. The chef, who grew up on Long Island, says that this menu is a tribute to his “Nana’s” rustic Italian immigrant cooking. As a child, Sobel spent a lot of time in his grandmother Louise’s kitchen. “She was the greatest person I’ve ever known. She taught me how to cook everything,” says Sobel. Food-wise, the menu will be reminiscent of the Sunday family suppers Sobel experienced growing up, so expect dishes like handmade tortellini, as well as orrechiette “Lou Lou Style” — just the way his grandmother made, with Italian sausage, broccoli rabe, chili flakes and pecorino. For dessert, look for an assortment of Italian sweets that includes zeppole, cannoli and rainbow cookies. As far as drinks, the menu will feature 20 Italian wines by the glass and bottle. In an absolutely old school move, each table will feature a house wine, available by the honor system. A selection of Italian beers and low-proof cocktails, inspired by Italian classics, will also be served. The pre-fixe format will remain similar to Middle’terranea with dishes served family style. Tickets will be 49/person and will go on-sale starting September 28th. Little Italy is set to run through at least the end of the year. Little Italy at Mina Test Kitchen, 2120 Greenwich St., S.F. minatestkitchen.com.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the official name of the event that launched the careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration? The Discovery Expedition of 1901–04, known officially as the British National Antarctic Expedition, was the first official British exploration of the Antarctic regions since James Clark Ross's voyage sixty years earlier. Organized on a large scale under a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), the new expedition carried out scientific research and geographical exploration in what was then largely an untouched continent. It launched the Antarctic careers of many who would become leading figures in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, including Robert Falcon Scott who led the expedition, Ernest Shackleton, Edward Wilson, Frank Wild, Tom Crean and William Lashly. Its scientific results covered extensive ground in biology, zoology, geology, meteorology and magnetism. The expedition discovered the existence of the only snow-free Antarctic valleys, which contain Antarctica's longest river. Further achievements included the discoveries of the Cape Crozier emperor penguin colony, King Edward VII Land, and the Polar Plateau (via the western mountains route) on which the South Pole is located. The expedition tried to reach the South Pole travelling as far as the Farthest South mark at a reported 82°17′S. As a trailbreaker for later ventures, the Discovery Expedition was a landmark in British Antarctic exploration history.

Next question: the tariff of 1828 was known throughout the south as the tariff of?","completion":"The Tariff of 1828, known throughout the South as the \\"Tariff of Abominations,\\" was a highly controversial piece of legislation enacted by the United States government on May 19, 1828. The primary purpose of this tariff was to protect the industries in the Northern United States by placing a heavy tax on imported goods. However, this legislation deeply angered the Southern states, which relied heavily on imported goods and foreign trade. The tariff was particularly disadvantageous to the agrarian South, which lacked the industrial base of the North and was more dependent on imported goods than its northern counterparts. As a result, the high duties imposed on these goods led to increased costs for Southern consumers and impacted the region's ability to engage in foreign trade. The economic impact of the Tariff of Abominations was particularly harsh in South Carolina, where the state's economy was especially reliant on foreign trade. South Carolina's leaders, under the guidance of states' rights advocate John C. Calhoun, went as far as to declare the tariff unconstitutional and to threaten to nullify it within the state's borders. This stance led to a heated political showdown between South Carolina and the federal government, known as the Nullification Crisis. The Nullification Crisis centered around the belief held by some Southerners that states had the right to reject or \\"nullify\\" federal laws they deemed unconstitutional. Calhoun, who was Vice President under President Andrew Jackson at the time, wrote an anonymous document called the South Carolina Exposition and Protest in 1828, which argued against the tariff and proposed the idea of state nullification. The crisis escalated further when South Carolina's legislature passed the Ordinance of Nullification in 1832, which declared the Tariff of Abominations, as well as the subsequent Tariff of 1832, null and void within the state's borders. In response, President Jackson issued a proclamation asserting the federal government's authority, and Congress passed the Force Bill, which gave Jackson the power to use the military to enforce federal laws. Although the situation ultimately deescalated after a compromise tariff was negotiated by Senator Henry Clay in 1833, the Tariff of Abominations and the resulting Nullification Crisis exposed deep-rooted sectional tensions that would continue to shape American politics in the years leading up to the Civil War. In conclusion, the Tariff of 1828, known throughout the South as the \\"Tariff of Abominations,\\" was a highly divisive piece of legislation that pitted the agrarian, import-dependent Southern states against the industrialized North. The resulting Nullification Crisis demonstrated the limitations of states' rights ideology and brought the issue of sectionalism to the forefront of American political discourse. The crisis foreshadowed the growing divide between the North and South that would later culminate in the American Civil War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

One, American Navy Commander Shears (William Holden), is revealed to routinely bribe guards to ensure he is put on the sick list, which allows him to avoid hard labour.A large contingent of British prisoners under the leadership of Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness) arrives, defiantly whistling the Colonel Bogey March as they march in. Because they were ordered by their superiors to surrender, Nicholson states that they should be obedient and cooperative prisoners. The Japanese camp commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), addresses them, informing them of his rules. He insists that all prisoners, regardless of rank, will work on the construction of a bridge over the Kwai River as part of a railroad that will link all Burma.The next morning, when Saito orders everyone, including officers, to work, Nicholson commands his officers to stand fast. He points out that the Geneva Conventions state that captured officers are exempt from manual labour. Saito is infuriated and backhands Nicholson in the face, but the latter refuses to back down, even after Saito has a machine gun set up threatening to shoot all the officers. Saito is dissuaded from shooting by Major Clipton (James Donald), a British medical officer prisoner, citing an inquiry and scandal should Saito carry through with the murder of officers. Instead, the Japanese commander leaves Nicholson and his officers standing in the intense heat. As the day wears on, one of them collapses from heat stroke, but Nicholson and the rest are still standing defiantly at attention when the prisoners return from the day's work. After Colonel Nicholson is beaten in Saito's quarters, the British officers are sent into a punishment cage and Nicholson into his own box for solitary confinement.When Clipton requests to be allowed to check the officers, Saito agrees on the condition that Clipton persuade Nicholson to change his mind.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, \\"Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite to happiness. \\"Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy. In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery . For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,\\"People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people who were extremely dissatisfied. \\" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time.

So far that song is at his best with his powerful vocals. I also liked the heartbroken ballad \\"She's Lost\\" which he plays the accoustic guitar on as well as the jazz flavoured \\"Sidewalks\\" which has great saxophone playing. Yes sir, this is the album to buy! I also enjoyed him in the folk-rock band \\"Bambi's Apaprtment\\" and can't wait to hear tracks from his new band \\"Ten Tiers\\" he'll also return as Ricky in \\"Return to Sleepaway Camp\\" which I'm looking forward to an hopefully he'll do the odd acting gig although his music comed first in life!

At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling. The present pattern of ice ages began about 40 million years ago.[citation needed]\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. For something that predicts the future, the software is deceptively simple looking. A map of a city is marked up with small red squares, each indicating a 500-by-500-foot zone where crimes are likely to take place next. A heat-map mode shows even more precisely where cars may be stolen, houses robbed, people mugged. The program is called PredPol, and it calculates its forecasts based on times and locations of previous crimes, combined with sociological information about criminal behavior and patterns. The technology has been beta tested in the Santa Cruz, California police department for the past year, and in an L.A. police precinct for the past six months, with promising results. Predictive-analytics software is the latest piece of policing technology working its way into law-enforcement stations around the country, although it's going up against tight budgets, bureaucracy and a culture still clinging to its analog ways. \\"We had to try something because we were not being offered more cops,\\" said Zach Friend, a crime analyst with the Santa Cruz Police Department. Last year, Friend contacted researchers working on the algorithm -- originally used for predicting earthquake aftershocks -- after reading an article in the LA Times. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage. At the time, his city had experienced a 30% increase in crime and a 20% decrease in police staff. He knew they had to try something. At first the Santa Cruz police department used the software to estimate where home, car and vehicle burglaries might take place, handing printouts of the maps to officers at the start of their shifts. Later it expanded it to bike thefts, battery, assault and prowling. The city has seen a 19% reduction in burglaries over the past year. While these kinds of experiments are promising, most police stations are still a far cry from the futuristic headquarters we see on TV shows like CSI. Real police departments lag behind your typical American teenager when it comes to technology -- some police cars still record video on VHS tapes, and it's not uncommon to fill out a police report on carbon paper. Last month, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee announced plans to develop a smartphone app that would allow officers to file police reports from the field. But SFPD chief information officer, Susan Giffin, told the Bay Citizen the department doesn't have the budget to buy smartphones on which to run the app. (San Francisco police officers only got e-mail addresses for the first time last year.) Thankfully for crime fighters, it's not all landlines, beepers and fax machines. Cool new crime-fighting technology is still being developed and tested by agencies around the country. There are gadgets such as Taser's small wearable cameras for police and other security professionals. The units can mount on a pair of Oakley sunglasses or a shirt collar, and they have accompanying Android and iOS apps. In Southern Florida, many police departments are using portable fingerprint scanners to ID suspects and bring up any outstanding warrants on the spot. The smartphone-sized devices cost 2,500 apiece. A ShotSpotter system uses microphones positioned around a city to detect gunshots and triangulate their location within 40 to 50 feet. A human at ShotSpotter's headquarters confirms if it's a gunshot and alerts the police. The system starts at 40,000 for every square mile of coverage. Some of the more widely adopted tech is decidedly low-budget. Police can Google suspects and check their Facebook profiles to gather information. Friend says the Santa Cruz department has had more luck posting photos of wanted suspects to the official department Facebook page than through traditional police channels. (The unusually tech-savvy department also has a Twitter account, blog, and YouTube channel.) Now predictive policing software is picking up steam, thanks to a few well-publicized test cases, low overhead and impressive drops in crime rates that, while they can't be directly tied to any one initiative, bode well for the maps. Hotel replaces printed Bibles with Kindles. PredPol is new to the field, but IBM has been testing predictive policing software since 2010, using databases of past crimes and information like timing and weather to identify trends and map out predictions. The company has worked with police departments in Memphis, New York City, and most recently Charleston, South Carolina. A final hurdle for all types of new technology is getting the officers themselves to adopt and use it. \\"Law enforcement agencies historically are conservative in their approach to change. That includes to adopting all kinds of technology, from computers in the cars to even radios,\\" said Friend. A new generation of police who have grown up immersed in technology will likely help ease the transition by communicating to older officers that the new tools only enhance what they already know. Seasoned patrol cops rely on their instincts, developed over years of experience walking the same streets and patrolling familiar neighborhoods. Experts say this new technology can cut down on paperwork and make policing more efficient so the police can focus on what they do best. \\"It doesn't replace what they do,\\" said Friend of PredPol. \\"When they get into those locations, they still need to be good cops.\\" Report: Next Kindle Fire will have camera, sharper display.

Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals. Which zoologist learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day? Answer:","completion":"Nate, the zoologist studying diurnal animals, likely learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day. Diurnal animals are creatures that are mainly active during the daytime and tend to rest or sleep at night. This is different from nocturnal animals, which are predominantly active during the night and rest or sleep during daylight hours. By studying diurnal animals, Nate would have focused his research on species that are generally awake and active throughout the day, which means he would encounter fewer animals that are sleeping during this time. Consequently, he would learn less about animals that engage in daytime sleep compared to Andy who studied nocturnal animals. On the other hand, Andy's research specifically targeted nocturnal species, which primarily sleep during the day. Through his studies, he would have gained knowledge about how these animals seek shelter and create suitable environments to promote daytime sleep. Additionally, Andy may have investigated the adaptations of nocturnal animals that enable them to effectively avoid predators and conserve energy during their inactive daytime period. Furthermore, Andy's zoological research would likely involve the exploration of various behaviors, lifestyles, and habitats among nocturnal species, providing him with the opportunity to engage with a diverse range of fauna that sleep throughout the day. In contrast, Nate's study of diurnal creatures would likely expose him predominantly to species that do not sleep during daylight hours, making his comparative knowledge of daytime-sleeping animals more limited. In summary, given the differences in activity patterns between diurnal and nocturnal animals, Nate, the zoologist who studied diurnal animals, would have learned less about animals that sleep during the day compared to Andy, who investigated nocturnal creatures. Nate's focus on animals active during daytime would have provided him with significantly fewer opportunities to gain insights into species that rely on daytime sleep for survival and energy conservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fulton's Social Security Card and bicycle license, bearing the address where he lived during his teenage years, were positioned in their respective compartments, apparently untouched since the year after World War Il ended. Worker Nathan Osborne found the wallet -- along with old homework, lost library books and a 1964 talent show program -- while removing the bleachers for renovations on June 17.

Write a text based on \\"china says vatican position restricts religious freedom\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Vatican's Position Raises Concerns Over Religious Freedom in China Introduction: The recent statements by the Vatican regarding its position on religious matters have sparked controversy, as China claims that these statements threaten and restrict religious freedom within its borders. This article aims to shed light on the ongoing debate, provide a brief background on Vatican-China relations, and outline the potential repercussions of the Vatican's position on religious freedom in China. Background: The relationship between China and the Vatican has been historically complex and marked by periods of cooperation and tension. In recent years, however, there have been efforts by both sides to establish diplomatic relations and address the challenges related to religious affairs in China. Despite these measures, reports have emerged suggesting that religious freedom remains an issue, and the Vatican's latest position has exacerbated these concerns. Vatican's Position: The Vatican has expressed the importance of upholding and respecting religious beliefs, calling for greater understanding and dialogue between different faith communities. While this may seem like a positive move towards fostering harmony, Chinese officials argue that the Vatican's position restricts religious freedom in their country. China's Reaction: According to Chinese authorities, the Vatican's position interferes with domestic matters, undermining the nation's sovereignty by attempting to influence and control its religious landscape. This, they claim, goes against the principle of non-interference in another country's affairs and limits the scope of religious freedom that Chinese citizens should enjoy. Impact on Religious Freedom: If the concerns raised by China are valid, the Vatican's position on religious matters could potentially lead to tensions between different faith communities, fostered by perceived external interference. This could have far-reaching consequences for religious freedom in China, where harmony and coexistence among different faiths is essential for maintaining social stability. Conclusion: As the debate between China and the Vatican continues, it is crucial to adopt a balanced approach that respects the rights and freedoms of all faiths while also acknowledging the need for diplomatic relations. Maintaining religious freedom is a matter of global importance, and any attempt to limit it could have significant repercussions.

The charity said there were a further six confirmed or probable cases in the town of Isiro. The outbreak, involving the Bundibugyo strain, was first reported last week after one person had died. Last month an outbreak of a more deadly ebola strain in neighbouring Uganda killed 16 people. The DR Congo outbreak occurred in Oriental province, which shares a border with Uganda. Medicins sans Frontieres (MSF) has said that the two outbreaks may not be related. It is not clear when exactly the deaths in Isiro occurred. A medical coordinator for MSF, Anja de Weggheleire, told the BBC the Bundibugyo strain was still dangerous, if less fatal than the one detected in Uganda. \\"It is normally less mortal and less virulent then the one we have seen in other places... But still it stays a very dangerous and mortal disease... we expect normally figures around 25 to 35% mortality,\\" Ms Weggheleire said. The charity says its staff in the affected area in north-east DR Congo are taking measures to locate and isolate anyone who has been in contact with those infected. Experts have said that Isiro's position as a transit point could make an outbreak more challenging to control. The virus, which is transmitted to humans from both monkeys and birds, causes massive internal bleeding and has a very high mortality rate. It is one of the most virulent diseases in the world and is spread by close personal contact. There is no vaccine for the virus and symptoms of infection include a sudden onset of fever, weakness, headache, vomiting and kidney problems.","completion":"An Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo involving the less fatal Bundibugyo strain has resulted in 10 deaths, with six other confirmed or probable cases in the town of Isiro, while its relation to the recent Ugandan outbreak remains unclear."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What did the man's mother teach him?\\" and the answer \\"Being nice has rewards.\\", write a conversation that might have happened. Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Establish the characters and setting In order to create a convincing conversation based on the given question and answer, I will first establish the characters involved. Since the question mentions a \\"man\\" and his \\"mother,\\" these two characters will be at the center of the dialogue. In terms of setting, I will choose a cozy living room for this discussion, as it is a place where family members often gather and talk. Step 2: Develop the conversation topic In order to reach the point where the man's mother teaches him that \\"being nice has rewards,\\" I will start the conversation with a topic where the mother can naturally introduce this idea. The topic could be about the man experiencing a challenging day or dealing with difficult people. Step 3: Create the dialogue Now that I have established the characters, setting, and topic, I will write the conversation using natural-sounding dialogue that leads to the mother teaching the son the specified lesson. Here is the conversation: Man: (sighs) I had such a rough day at work today, Mom. My coworker was being difficult, and I just couldn't seem to get through to him. Mother: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, dear. What exactly happened? Man: Well, he kept dismissing my ideas in front of everyone, and it was really frustrating. I tried to be patient and understanding, but there were moments when I just wanted to snap at him. Mother: (nods) It can be tough dealing with people like that. But you know, your father and I always taught you to be kind and patient, even in difficult situations. Man: I know, and I tried my best to stay calm and polite. But sometimes it feels like being nice doesn't get me anywhere. Mother: I understand that feeling. However, remember what I used to tell you: being nice has its rewards. You may not see the immediate results, but in the long run, people will appreciate your kindness and it will reflect well on your character. Step 4: Conclude the conversation Having reached the point where the mother shares the lesson, I will now conclude the conversation with the man showing his understanding and appreciation for his mother's wisdom. Man: You're right, Mom. It's important to stay kind, even when it's not easy. I always appreciate your guidance and advice. Thanks for reminding me about the rewards of being nice.

The provided answer options are \\"+Yes\\" and \\"+No.\\" Step 2: Understand the context of the question. The question states that Skylar got Riley's car back from the parking lot to go home. We are asked about the validity of the statement \\"get in the car\\" regarding what will happen to Riley. Step 3: Consider the possible interpretations. Based on the context, we could interpret \\"get in the car\\" as Riley joining Skylar to get in the car and go home. Alternatively, it could be that Riley simply gets in the car Skylar returned, independent of Skylar's presence or going home. Step 4: Compare the possible interpretations with the given answer options. Our possible interpretations are outcomes for Riley (\\"get in the car\\"), whereas the given answer options are simple affirmations or negations (\\"+Yes\\" and \\"+No\\"). Step 5: Determine the validity of the statement. Given that \\"get in the car\\" describes a possible outcome for Riley in this scenario, while the provided answer options represent an affirmation or negation of an outcome, the two sets of choices (our interpretations and the answer options) do not match in format.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood...

Select from the following. [-] use a melon baller or a dull knife or paring knife. [-] use a basketballer or a dull knife or paring knife.","completion":"To remove the apple core for a pi day pie, the most sound option, in terms of naive physics reasoning, is to use a melon baller or a dull knife or paring knife. Below is a detailed explanation on why this option is more suitable compared to using a basketballer or a dull knife or paring knife. 1. Melon baller: A melon baller is a kitchen tool with a small, rounded scoop designed to carve a spherical shape from the flesh of fruits like melons. It is an ideal tool for removing the apple core as its small size and rounded edge can help in scooping the core and seeds out of the apple without causing too much damage to the surrounding flesh. A melon baller provides good control, and with its sharp edge, it can easily remove the apple core. 2. Dull knife: Although sharp knives are usually preferred for slicing and dicing fruits, a dull knife can be used to remove the apple core as well. With a steadier hand and a certain level of precision, a dull knife can scoop out the core without creating a significant mess. The flat blade of the knife allows for better control while digging into the apple and carving around the core. However, using a dull knife can be slightly more challenging than using a melon baller or paring knife. 3. Paring knife: A paring knife is another suitable tool for removing the core from an apple. It is a small, sharp knife that is perfect for intricate tasks like peeling, seeding, and slicing fruits. The paring knife's pointed tip can be inserted into the top or bottom of the apple core, and with a gentle, twisting motion, the core can be detached and extracted. The sharpness of the paring knife makes this process more manageable and precise. In contrast, the other option – using a basketballer – is unsuitable for the following reasons: 1. Basketballer: The term \\"basketballer\\" refers to someone who plays basketball professionally or for recreation. However, it does not apply to the process of removing an apple core. Attempting to use a basketballer would not be effective in the context of removing the core, and it lacks the required properties to serve as a useful tool in this context. From a naive physics reasoning standpoint, using a basketballer would not yield the desired results in the apple coring process. In conclusion, the more sound solution for removing the apple core for a pi day pie is to use a melon baller, a dull knife, or a paring knife. These tools provide precision, control, and effectiveness in removing the apple core without causing excessive damage to the surrounding fruit flesh. Using a basketballer for this purpose is not a viable option and doesn't relate to the task at hand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

This can be done by following several steps, including active listening, sharing personal experiences, being open-minded, maintaining a sense of humor, and exhibiting emotional intelligence. 1. Engage in conversation: Now that you have found some common ground, put it to use by initiating a conversation.

How cute was that cat? MEOW!” Brandi wrote. Brandi made quite the impression herself. Wearing in a white mini dress and black and white strappy high heels, she was asked to pose on the carpet by photographers who recognized the family resemblance. Though Brandi, 26, has stepped out with her more famous younger sis in the past, the older Cyrus sib is clearly making a name for herself. Keep reading to learn 5 things you may not have known about Brandi Cyrus. 1. She’s Actually Miley’s Half Sister Brandi and her brother Trace are Tish Cyrus’ children from her previous marriage to Baxter Neal Helson. When Tish married Billy Ray Cyrus in 1993, she had already given birth to their daughter Miley. They had two more children together, and Billy Ray adopted Brandi and Trace. 2. She’s A Fan of Social Media On her Twitter page, where she has over a half million followers, Brandi describes herself as “songwriter, musician, blogger, designer, competitive equestrian.” She has her own blog on Buzznet, where she writes about music and fashion. 3. She’s a Musician Too Brandi plays guitar and is one half of the pop duo Frank + Derol, who are signed to Interscope records. She has also played for Miley and Billy Ray on previous tours. 4. She Has Acted Alongside Her Sister Brandi once called herself “the forgotten” Cyrus child, though she has shared the spotlight with her younger sister. Brandi appeared as a guitarist, customer and “hoedown throwdown dancer” in Miley’s “Hannah Montana” series. 5. She Has the Same Shoe Size as Miley Brandi paired her sparkly dress with strappy, zebra-printed Christian Louboutin stilettos — borrowed from her little sister. During Brandi’s interview with her famous sib, Miley said she was mad that the cameras were only catching Brandi from the waist up. “You can’t see the shoes that I had you wear,” the pop star said. “And they were limited edition.” Brandi confessed that she had to ditch the shoes, because her feet were hurting, but she and her sister ended their exchange with a kiss and “love you.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Miley Cyrus' older sister, Brandi Cyrus, made an impression at the American Music Awards and is a musician, songwriter, and actress in her own right.

More than 2,000 children disappear every day in the United States. These are some of the high-profile cases from over the last 80 years. Authorities in Europe and across the world are working to determine the identity of an abducted girl found in Greece. The girl known as Maria was apparently kidnapped by a Gypsy couple. She was initially believed to be 4 years old but a dental exam now indicates she is 5 or 6. The FBI and Greek authorities will work to determine that the child isn't that of missing Kansas City toddler Lisa Irwin as well as other missing children. Known as Baby Lisa, the infant was almost a year old when she went missing in early October 2011. \\"There is no such thing as a tip too small,\\" Lisa's mother, Debbie Bradley, told CNN. She broke down and cried in an interview with Inside Edition. She said she hopes the little girl found in Greece is her daughter. But she said if she is not that it gives her additional hope that her daughter will be found. Lisa's third birthday is next month and an age-progression photo of her was released earlier this month on the second anniversary of her disappearance. While the ages wouldn't seem to match, the possible similar physical appearance between Lisa and Maria means all possibilities must be ruled out. Maria is blonde and blue-eyed while Lisa was fair and blue-eyed at the time of her disappearance. \\"I am not sure there are enough similarities between the girls,\\" a federal law enforcement official told CNN. Still, the official added, the FBI is working with Greek authorities to determine whether the girl could be Lisa. Media outlets report that the possibility that Maria is Lisa is one of eight serious leads that authorities in Greece are pursuing. John Picerno, an attorney for Lisa's parents, Debbie Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, said Monday night that he has had contact with the FBI about the investigation in Greece. He said the FBI is working through the appropriate government channels in Greece as they work to determine the girl's identity. Picerno said he has not been given a timeline for the investigation in Greece. \\"Whenever the authorities in Greece investigate and inform us, we will know,\\" he wrote in an email to KCTV5. While police have focused on the activities of Bradley, the couple has long maintained that they had nothing to do with their daughter's disappearance and she was abducted by someone who sought to raise her.

The inquiry by Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, whose daughter Lisa Irwin vanished in Kansas City, Missouri, in 2011, was on Monday reported to be among eight leads being taken seriously by Greek police, who have launched an international search for Maria’s true identity. Of the other seven, another three are in the United States, while there is one each in Canada, Sweden, France and Poland. On Monday night no one in the US or Europe had come forward publicly to claim the child, who has been taken into care by Smile of the Child, a charity based in Athens. John Picerno, a lawyer for Mr Irwin and Ms Bradley, said the couple’s interest in the girl’s discovery had been registered, but declined to elaborate further. “We enquire about every child that is found and fits the age profile of Lisa,” Mr Picerno told The Daily Telegraph . “We investigate all leads. I don’t have any further comment at this stage.” Lisa was said to have vanished from the family’s home in Kansas City in October 2011, at the age of 10 months. Like the girl found in Greece, she had blue eyes. Ms Bradley claimed that an intruder snatched the baby from her cot while she was passed out drunk in the bedroom and while Mr Irwin was working late. However, the parents have been accused of giving conflicting accounts of what happened. Smile of the Child has been inundated with calls and emails about Maria since taking her in. “By Sunday evening, we had received more than 8,000 calls and thousands of emails,” said Panagiotis Pardalis, a spokesman for the charity. He said the organisation’s website had received more than 200,000 visits and its Facebook page about half a million. “We even have calls from Japan and South Africa now,” added Stefanos Alevizos, a psychologist for the charity. Interpol has 38 girls under the age of six on its database of missing children but said none matched Maria’s description. Prosecutors on Monday requested an “anthropological analysis” to try to narrow down the countries she could have come from. ||||| The FBI is joining the international authorities searching for the parents of the 4-year-old girl now known as \\"Maria,\\" who was found in a Roma camp. NBC's Michelle Kosinski reports. ATHENS -- An American couple whose baby daughter vanished from their Kansas City home two years ago has contacted authorities in Greece who are trying to solve the mystery surrounding a blond girl found in a Roma camp. Reuters Lisa Irwin vanished from her home in Kansas City, Mo., in Oct. 2011. Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, whose 10-month-old daughter Lisa Irwin disappeared in October 2011, got in touch with the The Smile of a Child charity that is heading up the hunt for the girl's biological parents, a spokesman confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday. John Picerno, a lawyer for the family, said he had contacted the FBI and the couple’s interest in the girl’s discovery had been registered. \\"The (FBI) agent has made an official inquiry through governmental channels with the authorities in Greece,\\" he said. \\"We are awaiting a response from them, which we anticipate will be forthcoming as soon as possible.\\" Lisa Irwin has not been seen since October 4, 2011, when her father came home from work to find the door unlocked, the lights on and the crib empty. The chances of the girl -- who is known as Maria -- being Lisa Irwin appeared to be slim because a dental examination suggested Maria is between five and six years old. “We enquire about every child that is found and fits the age profile of Lisa,” Picerno told Britain's Telegraph newspaper. “We investigate all leads.” A spokesman for The Smile of a Child charity told NBC News that of the 10,000 calls and emails they received around eight or 10 were being more closely looked into, including cases in the U.S., Sweden, Poland and France. Police raiding a Roma – or Gypsy – camp in central Greece found a young fair-skinned, blonde girl who was living with a couple later proven not to be her parents. NBC's Michelle Kosinski reports. Kostas Giannopoulos, the charity's president, said that although Maria remained in a Greek hospital, she was in \\"good condition\\" and making progress. “She is happy and playing” he said. “She has learned Greek words better than expected so we are very positive.” Previously, Maria had only spoken a few words in the Roma dialect as well as Greek, although police think she may be of northern or eastern European origin, possibly from Scandinavia or Bulgaria. Giannopoulos added that she had been a little picky about her food and a little stubborn. “When communicating she mostly communicates about the present and not the past,\\" he added. Maria was spotted peeking out from under a blanket last Wednesday as police swept the Roma settlement for suspected drug trafficking near Farsala, a small town around 170 miles north of Athens. Roma also have been called Gypsies, though that term is considered derogatory. Greek Police via Reuters Eleftheria Dimolpoulou, left, and Christos Salis, right, are seen with Maria. Officers told Reuters the couple gave at least five conflicting accounts of how the child ended up with them, including that she was found outside a supermarket. Confused that her coloring did not match that of Christos Salis, 39, and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, who were claiming to be her parents, police ran DNA tests and discovered they were not biologically related. Officers told Reuters the couple gave at least five conflicting accounts of how the child ended up with them, including that she was found outside a supermarket. The woman had two different identification documents and other papers suggested the couple had up to 14 children, but six were registered as having been born within less than 10 months. They received 2,790 euros (3,800) a month in child benefits, a police source told Reuters. The couple faced magistrates on Monday to respond to charges of abduction and procuring false documents but were ordered to be held in custody until they face trial. A date has not been set. They denied snatching Maria and said her mother handed the girl to them shortly after giving birth, one of their lawyers Constantinos Katsavos, told reporters outside the court. She's being called the \\"blonde angel,\\" and it was a four-year-old girl's blonde hair and pale skin that led to her rescue. The search is now on for her parents. NBC's Duncan Golestani reports. \\"It was an adoption that was not exactly legal but took place with the mother's consent,\\" he said, adding that is what the couple testified. Police have sent Interpol a file with all the evidence they have on the girl, including DNA samples, to seek a possible match with records of missing children. The possibility of a smuggling ring - in which pregnant women were brought into Greece from Bulgaria and their children put up for sale - was also being investigated, according to Greek state-owned news agency Amna. Meanwhile, in the Republic of Ireland, police on Monday removed a blue eyed, blonde haired seven-year-old girl from a Roma family. Officials had gotten a tip-off that a young girl was living with the large family but looked nothing like her brothers and sisters, Ireland's Sunday World reported on Tuesday. The child has been taken into care while the investigation is ongoing, the paper reported. NBC News' Katerina Voussoura and Reuters contributed to this report. Henry Austin reported from London.

Police say about 500 tips have been mistaken sightings, and several have stemmed from online rumors. There have been no arrests. KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Almost two years have passed since a 10-month-old baby was reported missing from her Kansas City home and the case is growing cold. Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin have said they believe someone kidnapped their daughter, Lisa Irwin, from her crib. Jeremy Irwin said that when he returned home from a late shift on Oct. 4, 2011, the front door was open and the baby was missing. Police and the FBI conducted extensive searches, even sifting through a Kansas landfill. No one has been charged. There is a 100,000 reward offered to anyone with information that will bring the child home. The family and their supporters will hold a prayer vigil Saturday night at their home, the Kansas City Star reported. In an effort to show what Lisa would look like today, an age-progression photo of her from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has been released. “I cannot force the people who know where Lisa is and who might have her into telling us. I have no control over that,” Bradley said. “You do what you can for your baby, because it is your job as a parent to protect your child, and I wasn’t able to protect her from the bad guys.” Police and a private detective are still investigating, but Kansas City Police Capt. Tye Grant said the tips and leads have slowed considerably, down to about one a week. During the first year, detectives worked more than 1,600 leads and countless baby sightings. Bradley and Irwin have repeatedly said they did not harm Lisa and had nothing to do with her disappearance. Bradley said she and Irwin think someone took Lisa and is raising the child as his or her own. “When she comes home and (with) all of the hateful things that certain people have said, they have to answer to their maker for judgment,” she said. “I will have my daughter back, and I will be vindicated, and those people that spent all of that time judging me will be miserable, but we won’t. “We will be happy again.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"In the United States, over 2,000 children disappear every day, and missing Kansas City toddler Lisa Irwin's case is one of the high-profile cases from over the past 80 years.

Select the topic that this about: Downriver economic development officials geared up Thursday to deal with the latest blow to area manufacturing workers, the closing of the Frito-Lay plant in Allen Park with its loss of nearly 400 jobs.","completion":"Downriver economic development officials have become increasingly concerned with the news of the Frito-Lay plant closure in Allen Park, which will lead to the loss of nearly 400 jobs. This significant event has a substantial impact on the local economy, and it is essential to analyze the situation while devising effective strategies to cope with the expected consequences. The crux of the matter revolves around the local manufacturing sector, which has been experiencing several challenges in recent years, including increased global competition and technological advancements. The primary concern for the Downriver economic development officials is to tackle the immediate issues faced by the 400 workers who will be affected by the Frito-Lay plant closure. Some of the pressing problems include unemployment, financial instability, and lack of alternative employment opportunities in the region. In this regard, the officials must develop a comprehensive plan to provide support to these workers, including provisions such as severance packages, unemployment benefits, job training and placement services, and financial counseling. Another essential aspect to consider is the overall impact of the plant closure on Allen Park and surrounding communities in the Downriver area. The loss of 400 jobs has direct and indirect effects on the local economy, with reduced consumer spending, associated income loss for nearby businesses, and potential negative implications for the housing market due to increased vacancies or foreclosures. To minimize the adverse effects of the closure, economic development officials should look into ways to attract new businesses and promote investment in the area to stimulate job growth and economic recovery. Attracting new businesses and promoting job creation necessitates a thorough analysis of the Downriver region's competitive advantages and weaknesses. Factors such as the availability of skilled workforce, favorable regulations for business development, access to transportation infrastructure, and a competitive tax and incentive structure are essential to consider. By working closely with state and federal authorities to identify synergies and develop appropriate programs, the Downriver economic development officials can bolster the region's ecosystem for growth and development. Investing in workforce training and development programs, and emphasizing the importance of advanced manufacturing and technology-driven industries are crucial factors that can help Downriver transition from its traditional industrial base to a more diversified and resilient economy. The success of these initiatives heavily depends on effective collaboration between economic development officials, industry participants, educational institutions, and workforce development agencies. By targeting high-growth industries and focusing on upskilling the workforce, the Downriver area can improve its competitive positioning and become an attractive hub for businesses looking to invest in the region. Finally, strategic partnerships and collaborations are crucial during these challenging times. By developing strong relationships with neighboring communities, regional business associations, and industry clusters, the Downriver economic development officials can profit from sharing best practices, resources, and expertise. Strengthening advocacy efforts in support of the region's unique needs will also play a critical role in securing attention, funding, and other resources from government bodies and private stakeholders. In conclusion, the announcement of the Frito-Lay plant closure in Allen Park presents a complex challenge with far-reaching consequences for the Downriver economy. The local economic development officials must respond proactively by implementing a multidimensional strategy that addresses the immediate needs of the displaced workers while also focusing on long-term initiatives aimed at diversifying the regional economy, attracting new businesses, and supporting workforce development efforts. By doing so, the officials can help mitigate the impact of this unfortunate event and pave the path towards a more sustainable, prosperous future for the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Days after Chicago police Officer Dina Markham was found dead in her bathtub a break-in took place at her Northwest Side home while her family attended her wake police records obtained by the Chicago Tribune show. The disclosure of the still-unsolved âcriminal trespassâ to the residence June 2 adds to the mystery surrounding Markham âs death as well as that of her husband also a veteran Chicago police officer whose gunshot death in the coupleâs bedroom 20 months earlier was ruled a suicide. The FBI and county authorities were still investigating the shooting of Sgt. Donald Markham in the coupleâs bed when his widowâs body was discovered in the bathtub at the residence over the Memorial Day weekend. The Cook County medical examinerâs office ruled Dina Markham 47 died May 28 of an accidental drowning after consuming a dangerous mix of alcohol and the powerful anti-anxiety drug alprazolam commonly sold under the brand name Xanax. Police had been called to the home in the Norwood Park neighborhood about 6 p.m. that evening after two of Markham âs friends said they discovered her unresponsive in the water-filled bathtub. According to records made public by the medical examiner Markham had texted a friend âHelp. Please ... no kiddingâ a little after 4 a.m. that day. Five days after Markham âs death a police officer discovered a sliding door open at the back of the house in the 5900 block of North Newark Avenue while conducting a âpremise checkâ about 10:30 p.m. June 2 according to the records released through the Freedom of Information Act. Two neighbors told police they didnât notice any activity at the house while the family attended Dina Markhamâs wake according to the records. In May shortly before Dina Markham's death at least two officers involved in the probe were interviewed at the state's attorney's offices about their roles in the investigation into Donald Markhamâs death the Tribune has reported. Records show that Dina Markham told police her husband 51 had locked her out of their home the night of his death in September 2015 after the couple had been out drinking and argued after leaving a bar about 1 a.m. In the 911 recordings released by the medical examinerâs office a distraught Dina Markham told an emergency dispatcher that her husband was unresponsive and bleeding from his head. She pleaded that an ambulance come to the home. Crime lab tests also showed Donald Markham had gunshot residue on his hand indicating he'd either fired a gun or was close to a weapon being discharged at the time of his death according to police records. The records do not indicate whether Dina Markham's hands were ever tested. Jim Bastian an attorney and close friend of Dina Markham's family previously told the Tribune that Markham had \\"heard rumors\\" of an investigation but had not been contacted for an interview by any law enforcement agency before her death. One of two friends who discovered her body told police that Dina Markham had called her twice at 3:59 a.m. but the friend didn't answer the phone because she was sleeping the reports show. Six minutes after the calls Markham sent the same friend the text asking for help.","completion":"Chicago Officer's Home Break-In Amid Death Investigations"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Salene falls in love with the chosen , Ellie , very unhappy and confused , but he rejects them for Luke .","completion":"These two sentences, despite their slight differences in structure, appear to convey the same core idea. However, some changes should be made to the sentences to ensure that they accurately reflect the intended meaning. Here’s a breakdown of the two sentences: 1. \\"Very unhappy and confused, Salene falls in love with the chosen, Luke, but he rejects them for Ellie.\\" This sentence suggests that Salene, who is unhappy and confused, falls in love with the chosen individual named Luke. However, Luke rejects Salene's love in favor of another person, Ellie. 2. \\"Salene falls in love with the chosen, Ellie, very unhappy and confused, but he rejects them for Luke.\\" In this sentence construction, it seems that Salene falls in love with the chosen individual named Ellie. But Ellie, who is very unhappy and confused, rejects Salene's love in favor of another person, Luke. However, the use of pronouns (\\"he\\" and \\"them\\") in the second sentence can create confusion, as they are not consistent with the person they are referring to. In addition, it is unclear whether \\"very unhappy and confused\\" refers to Salene or Ellie in this context. To make these sentences more clear, the pronouns and adjectives should be adjusted as follows: 1. \\"Very unhappy and confused, Salene falls in love with the chosen, Luke, but he rejects her for Ellie.\\" 2. \\"Salene falls in love with the chosen, Ellie, who is very unhappy and confused, but she rejects her for Luke.\\" Now, with these revisions, the two sentences convey different meanings: 1. Salene is unhappy and confused, falls in love with Luke, but Luke rejects her love for Ellie. 2. Salene falls in love with Ellie, who is unhappy and confused, but Ellie rejects her love for Luke. In conclusion, the original two sentences seemed to convey the same core idea because of their similar structure, but after correctly placing the adjectives and pronouns in each sentence, the true meaning shows that the two sentences are not the same. The first sentence describes Salene falling in love with Luke but being rejected in favor of Ellie, while the second sentence describes Salene falling in love with Ellie but being rejected in favor of Luke."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"But at that moment, I was far too carried away with my own feelings.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I didn't worry about my own feelings.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the premise, \\"But at that moment, I was far too carried away with my own feelings,\\" the hypothesis \\"I didn't worry about my own feelings\\" is not true. Instead, the premise conveys the exact opposite sentiment, implying that the individual in question was deeply focused on and absorbed by their own emotions, perhaps even to the neglect of everything else that may have been happening around them. A key phrase in the premise that supports this conclusion is \\"far too carried away,\\" which suggests that the individual's feelings were overwhelming or all-consuming. This indicates that their emotions were so powerful that they became their primary focus, preventing them from paying attention to other aspects of their life or environment. If the premise were replaced with \\"But at that moment, I was far too preoccupied with other matters to worry about my own feelings,\\" then the hypothesis \\"I didn't worry about my own feelings\\" would be congruent with the premise. In that case, the individual would be absorbed by something other than their emotions, leading to a lack of focus on their feelings. However, as the original premise is stated, the hypothesis \\"I didn't worry about my own feelings\\" does not hold up. Instead, it would be more accurate to hypothesize that the individual was intensely focused on their own feelings, perhaps at the expense of noticing or addressing other concerns. This overwhelming preoccupation with their emotions would have made it difficult for them to maintain a balanced perspective or consider the feelings of others around them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the profession of the person who said that the Quran had many variations but now only one? Context: The Quran most likely existed in scattered written form during Muhammad's lifetime. Several sources indicate that during Muhammad's lifetime a large number of his companions had memorized the revelations. Early commentaries and Islamic historical sources support the above-mentioned understanding of the Quran's early development. The Quran in its present form is generally considered by academic scholars to record the words spoken by Muhammad because the search for variants has not yielded any differences of great significance.[page needed] University of Chicago professor Fred Donner states that \\"...there was a very early attempt to establish a uniform consonantal text of the Qurʾān from what was probably a wider and more varied group of related texts in early transmission. [...] After the creation of this standardized canonical text, earlier authoritative texts were suppressed, and all extant manuscripts—despite their numerous variants—seem to date to a time after this standard consonantal text was established.\\" Although most variant readings of the text of the Quran have ceased to be transmitted, some still are. There has been no critical text produced on which a scholarly reconstruction of the Quranic text could be based. Historically, controversy over the Quran's content has rarely become an issue, although debates continue on the subject.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Have you seen a historical film recently? Do you think it was accurate? Some say that there is no such thing as a historical film. In many cases, Hollywood film-makers simply change the facts. Just look at these supposedly \\"historical\\" films. 1. The Patriot The film was released in 2000 and was directed by Ronald Emmerish and starred Mel Gibson. It is set near Charleston, South Carolina, during the American Revolutionary War(1775--1783) and follows the story of Benjamin Martin and his fight for American freedom against the British. The film was criticized for inventing and exaggerating British cruelty. The most criticized scene was one showing the burning of a church containing people of the town, of which there is no historical record. Another historical inaccuracy was the description of American-owned slaves being freed to serve with the American forces. In reality, many slaves ran away from their American owners and fought with the British against the Americans. 2. Brave Heart The film(1995) starred Mel Gibson was directed by Toby Reisz. It is based on the life of Scottish national hero William Wallace and his fight against English rule in Scotland during the 13th century. The film includes an affair between William Wallace and Princess Isabella (based on Isabella of France). The film implies she is a mother-to-be when William Wallace will be killed. However, historically, the real Isabella was a child of nine still living in France at this time, never having met Wallace. The film also caused controversy because of its anti-English nature. Apparently, when the film was shown in Glasgow, there was a loud noise made by happy American audience. 3. U-571 This 2000 film was directed by Jonathan Mostow and starred Mathew MacConaughey, Havey Keitel and Jon Bon Jovi. It took place during the Second World War(1939--1945). In the film, a German submarine(warship underwater) is boarded in 1942 by American soldiers who made themselves up as Germans. They took away the German submarine's code-language machine, which,...

Movie title: World Without End Context: In March 1957, Commander Dr. Eldon Galbraithe (Nelson Leigh), engineer Henry Jaffe (Christopher Dark), radioman Herbert Ellis (Rod Taylor) and scientist John Borden (Hugh Marlowe), are returning to Earth from the first spaceflight, a reconnaissance trip around Mars. Suddenly, their spaceship is somehow accelerated to incredible velocities, and they are knocked unconscious. Their ship crash lands on a snow-covered mountain. When they venture out, they discover that they have become victims of time dilation and are now in Earth's future. They theorize, from seeing time-worn gravestones and after their ship's instruments register heightened residual radiation, that a devastating atomic war had broken out in 2188, and that they are at least 200 years past that date. (They later learn that the year is 2508). Jaffe is particularly hard hit, as he realizes that his wife and children have long since died. After surviving an ambush by giant, mutant spiders, they are attacked by one of two competing remnants of human society. The \\"mutates\\" (as the astronauts label them) are violent, primitive surface dwellers. They have mutated due to generations of exposure to heightened radioactivity. (However, the background radiation has decreased to tolerable levels, and the men later learn that normal humans are often born to the mutates. These, however, are enslaved.) Seeking shelter from the attacking mutates in a cave, the four men discover the entrance to an underground city, whose residents are the descendants of those who fled there from the atomic war. These people live in a high-tech, sophisticated culture. They are a peaceful group led by Timmek (Everett Glass), the president of the ruling council. Underground, the men have grown less virile, and there are fewer and fewer children born each generation. In contrast, the women remain physically vital (and ready for romance).

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Steven Vasquez directed and co-wrote with James Townsend, the star, this strange little drama cum horror flick with evidently very good ideas and intentions: make a gay film that takes a different storyline than the usual fare and make a drama that wants to be judged on its merits as a thriller. So why doesn't it work? For starters the film loses direction from the opening frame and wanders rather aimlessly throughout the film, dead set on making a suspense thriller but getting sidetracked into satisfying an audience who wants to see nude encounters. Not that that is a bad thing: it can certainly enhance some films that have been Hollywood successes. The film also tries to talk about coming out experiences in young men and women, relationships, disturbed parenting, the club scene with all the wild antics that accompany such events - and murder. It is all a bit much to cram into a 96-minute film. Devon (James Townsend) by all appearances is a successful kid with a kind girlfriend Jenna (Sarah Kelly) but he has an eye for boys and visits a bar where he meets Brian (Alex Wilson) who has been down the same path and can offer Devon assistance on every level. They bond, Devon comes out, and the mysteries begin: boys are missing in the neighborhood, Devon's stepfather psychologist Dr. Kirk Tyler (Dan Swett) is not at all what he appears to be and despite Devon's consoling mother Donna (Sonja Fisher) Devon is cast into the streets because of his new relationship. It seems Dr Tyler is in a dark business with hunky Detective Cunningham (Earl McDougle) who apparently is investigating the missing boys... Devon gathers his resources from his understanding girlfriend Jenna and her cronies and together the group unveils the dark doings of Dr. Tyler and his detective sidekick. And through it all Donna radiates warmth and understanding as the perfect mother of a gay boy, etc. Some of the actors are pleasing to the eye (and there is very little the eye doesn't examine frequently!) but the degree of acting is at an all time low. The only thing that makes us forgive that (and in some cases it is just too poor to forgive) is the feeling of commitment on the part of everyone involved. Yes, this is a low budget movie and yes, the director needs time to learn his trade. But in the end there is something to be said for the involved people to try to take a gay film to a different level. Maybe their next one will be more polished.

Three years ago he was busted/ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving NOT a hybrid, a Yugo, or even a GM Metro but a LINCOLN (go google it if you like)! Or how about the fact that Mr. Gore & his Hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\" So much for conservation huh, Al? Anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" & discover the main fundamental flaw. While the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the EFFECTS of supposed \\"global Warming\\" there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed CAUSE of it. For example: I can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot & they can point out an automobile which is not running right. BUT can they tell you with any degree of certainty WHY? Generally not!

Choices: - dendrites - synapses - Sensory Receptors - the nodes A: The answer is:","completion":"The nodes, specifically, the nodes of Ranvier. The extracellular fluid is in contact with the axon membrane only at the nodes, which are small gaps in the myelin sheath. To understand this better, let's delve into the structure and function of neurons, which are the primary cells within the nervous system. Neurons are comprised of several parts: the soma (cell body), dendrites, the axon, and axon terminal. These components work in coordination to transmit signals within the nervous system. Dendrites: These are projections that extend from the soma, receiving signals from other neurons and transmitting them towards the cell body. Synapses: These are the junctions between neurons where information is exchanged. They can be electrical or chemical, and information is transmitted using neurotransmitters that cross the synaptic cleft. Sensory Receptors: They are specialized cells that detect specific stimuli, such as touch, pressure, or temperature, and convert them into electrical signals, which are then relayed to neurons. Axons: The axon is a long, slender projection that transmits electrical signals away from the soma towards other neurons, muscles, or glands. An insulating myelin sheath covers many axons, which functions to increase the speed of signal transmission and prevent signal degradation. The myelin sheath has gaps known as the nodes of Ranvier. At these nodes, the axon membrane is in direct contact with the extracellular fluid, enabling the exchange of ions across the membrane. This is essential for the proper conduction of electrical impulses along the axon. In summary, the extracellular fluid is only in contact with the axon membrane at the nodes of Ranvier. This unique structure facilitates efficient signal conduction within the nervous system by enabling ions to cross the membrane at select locations, thus propagating the electrical impulses rapidly while conserving energy."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Paragraph: Health officials have warned that the region, home to a fifth of the world’s population, could be the new frontline against the disease because of millions living in packed slums and fragile public health systems. India’s caseload rose to 13,387, a jump of nearly 700 over the previous day, despite a harsh lockdown now in its fourth week and which will last at least until early May. Authorities have identified a fifth of India’s hundreds of districts as red zones with the highest number of cases, including the cities of New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad. But Lav Agarwal, federal health joint secretary leading the fight against the coronavirus, said the rate of increase of infections was slowing because of the lockdown of 1.3 billion people in the world’s second-most populous country after China. Before the shutdown, the number of cases was doubling every three days, but now it was taking 6.2 days to double, Agarwal said, citing government data. “There is a decline, but we have to remain (in) the fight,” he said. The government has said it will permit farm and industrial activity in parts of the countryside that are least affected by the coronavirus from next week to lessen the pain for millions. Authorities in the resort islands of the Maldives placed the capital Male under a 14-day lockdown after eight people tested positive over the last three days, taking the total to 28. The government had earlier stopped all travel to and from the tropical islands and shut down businesses. But on Friday, the Health Protection Agency issued strict stay-at-home orders for Male, home to 40 percent of the country’s population of 450,000, fearing a big outbreak in the congested city. Maldives, best known for its white sands and palm-fringed atolls, reported its first case at the beginning of March when two employees of an island resort tested positive. Bangladesh also warned its 160 million people that the country was at risk after positive cases were detected in 45 districts out of a total of 64. It warned of strict action against anyone violating stay-at-home orders. “Only social distancing can keep the outbreak under control as no vaccine or treatment is available for the disease,” the directorate general of health services said in a statement. The big worry remains the low level of testing across the region. India has slowly raised the number to a little over 27,000 on Thursday, but in comparison with other countries it remains small given the huge population. India has tested 203 people per million of its population, lower than Brazil (296) and well behind the United States at 9,866 and Italy 18,481, all of which are themselves considered laggards in the race to screen as many people as possible. Here are official government figures on the spread of the coronavirus in South Asia: * India has 13,387 confirmed cases, including 437 deaths * Pakistan has 5,988 cases, including 107 deaths * Bangladesh has 1838 cases, including 75 deaths * Afghanistan has 906 cases, including 30 deaths * Sri Lanka has 238 cases, including 7 deaths * Maldives has 28 cases and no deaths * Nepal has 16 cases and no deaths * Bhutan has five cases and no deaths Interactive graphic tracking global spread of coronavirus: open tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7 in an external browser Claim: South Asia coronavirus cases hit 22,000 as Maldives locks down capital.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: As it turned out, Greg would have had a hard time canceling the check, even if he'd changed his mind. Chloe's crew had already sprung into action as soon as they left the building. The company used a computer controlled switchboard to route phone calls and this immediately went down, same for their Internet access. Meanwhile, a crude but effective denial of service attack was launched against their company Web site. If Greg decided to use his cell phone there wasn't much they could do, but the hope was that he'd be so tied up with all this other crap that he wouldn't have time to think of that. Paul didn't think any of that was necessary. Greg had given in and he wasn't going to call and cancel the check now. He'd agreed for a reason, and once Greg had a reason for making a decision it was usually impossible to change his mind. And it didn't make sense anyway. All he would have done is buy himself a little more time. Chloe and Paul would just march right back in and start all over again - probably after sending out pics of Evan in drag to all the employees. From his point of view, there was no reason for Greg to do that. Of course, it was still a huge risk for Chloe and Paul. If Greg just wanted a delay to get the lawyers involved, then they were in trouble. Chloe and he had broken a fist full of laws in the past twelve hours. They needed to cash that check and disappear as soon as they could. The bank put up a bit of a fuss about the check, which was one more reason Paul hated Bank of Fucking America. They always had some rule to screw a customer. But Chloe made a bunch of noise and actually jumped up and down at one point and eventually they walked out of the bank with a cashier's check. Question: Why didn't Paul feel concern? Options: - He could blackmail Greg with pictures of Evan in drag. - not enough information - Once Greg made up his mind, it was hard to change. - He knew he and Chloe was just do it all over again. === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"Once Greg made up his mind, it was hard to change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Marcus has a long day ahead of him. He woke up early, around 7 AM to start his day. For a research study he takes his blood pressure around 9 AM and continues on through his day. Around noon he takes his blood pressure again noting that it has increased a little. He takes his blood pressure one more time before going to bed around 10PM and a hint : Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Please answer this question : Will an animals blood pressure be at its highest in the middle of the day or at its lowest? A:","completion":"Based on the provided information about circadian rhythms and their influence on blood pressure and other biological processes, it is likely that an animal's blood pressure will be at its highest in the middle of the day. This is because most activities, including eating and drinking, tend to occur during daytime hours, causing physiological changes within the body. Additionally, in humans, blood pressure changes in a regular way throughout the 24-hour cycle, with an increase during the day. However, it is essential to note that the specific patterns of circadian rhythms may vary among different animal species.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. O'Neill was born in a hotel, the Barrett House, at Broadway and 43rd Street, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square). A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. After suffering from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O'Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinsons-like tremor in his hands which made it impossible for him to write during the last 10 years of his life; he had tried using dictation but found himself unable to compose in that way. While at Tao House, O'Neill had intended to write a cycle of 11 plays chronicling an American family since the 1800s. Only two of these, A Touch of the Poet and More Stately Mansions, were ever completed. As his health worsened, O'Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. He managed to complete Moon for the Misbegotten in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. Drafts of many other uncompleted plays were destroyed by Carlotta at Eugene's request. O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University's Shelton Hall) on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: \\"I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.\\" Dr. Harry Kozol, the lead prosecuting expert of the Patty Hearst trial, treated O'Neill during these last years of illness. He also was present for O'Neill's death and announced the fact to the public. O'Neill is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. In 1956 Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. This last play is widely considered to be his finest. Other posthumously-published works include A Touch of the Poet (1958) and More Stately Mansions (1967). The United States Postal Service honored O'Neill with a Prominent Americans series (1965-1978) 1 postage stamp.

The playing time of a phonograph record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing. At the beginning of the 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes. Because a 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the standard size for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59. What factors would effect playing time of a phonograph?","completion":"The playing time of a phonograph record is affected by various factors, such as: 1. Turntable speed: The rotational speed of the turntable on which the record plays has a significant impact on the playing time. Records with a faster speed, such as 78 rpm (revolutions per minute), have shorter playing times because the stylus covers more groove length per minute. Slower speeds, such as 33⅓ or 45 rpm, typically increase playing time as the stylus moves through the grooves at a slower pace, allowing for more sound to be recorded. 2. Groove spacing: The spacing between the grooves on a record also affects its playing time. Widely spaced grooves allow for longer sound waves, resulting in longer playing time. Conversely, more grooves packed into a given space will result in less space for each sound wave, leading to a reduced playing time. Some records utilize microgroove technology, featuring narrower grooves, which can hold more recording time. 3. Record size: The physical size of the record itself plays a role in determining the playing time. Larger records have more surface area, allowing for more grooves and thus more playing time. For instance, a 12-inch record can hold more audio than a 10-inch record. As mentioned in the article, the introduction of the 12-inch disc in 1903 increased the playing time of phonograph records. 4. Recording techniques: The techniques used during recording can also impact the playing time. Some recording processes compress the sound waves, fitting more audio content within a given space. However, this can sometimes lead to reduced audio quality. 5. Material: The quality and type of material the record is made of can also affect the playing time. Softer materials, such as vinyl, allow for deeper and wider grooves, leading to better audio quality and longer playing times, while harder materials, like shellac found in early 78 rpm records, often have shallower grooves, resulting in shorter playing times. In summary, the playing time of a phonograph record is influenced by factors including turntable speed, groove spacing, record size, recording techniques, and the material used to create the record. Advances in technology and manufacturing processes allowed for adjustments in these factors, thereby improving playing times and audio quality over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Duration of rainfall impacts the infiltration capacity as well. Initially when the precipitation event first starts the infiltration is occurring rapidly as the soil is unsaturated, but as time continues the infiltration rate slows as the soil becomes more saturated.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What do ancathostega have four of?\\" is Limbs. Acanthostega is considered one of the earliest tetrapods found and provides essential insights into the early evolution of vertebrates. Tetrapods are defined as vertebrates with four limbs, and as amphibians, they represent the first true tetrapods. Acanthostega lived during the late Devonian period, approximately 360 million years ago. This ancient creature played a crucial role in the transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments of early vertebrates. While it still possessed some fish-like features, it was characterized by its distinct four limbs. The limbs of Acanthostega were relatively short, with well-developed digits. They most likely allowed the creature to navigate shallow waters and the bottoms of swamps, although its flat and sprawling limbs were not as adapted to terrestrial life compared to some of its later descendants. Its limbs retained some flipper-like characteristics, suggesting that it was not yet fully adapted to walking on land. Other options listed in the answer choices like eggs, feet, wings, alveoli, lungs, ovaries, and rings do not represent the primary characteristic that defines Acanthostega as one of the first true tetrapods. While it's true that Acanthostega had lungs, it also had gills, further illustrating its evolutionary journey from water to land. The limbs of this ancient amphibian reveal vital information about the gradual transition from fins to limbs in the evolutionary history of vertebrates. In summary, Acanthostega, as one of the earliest and most complete tetrapods, is best characterized by its four limbs. These limbs provide critical evidence of the evolutionary steps taken by early vertebrates in their adaptation to life on land, marking a significant milestone in the history of life on Earth."},{"prompt":"Q: What proteins synthesized in cells act as catalysts?

Here's a step-by-step solution to the problem: Step 1: Write down the given equation. 72*v = 98*v + 104 Step 2: Move all terms containing the variable, v, to one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 98*v from both sides of the equation: 72*v - 98*v = 98*v - 98*v + 104 Step 3: Simplify the equation. -26*v = 104 Step 4: Isolate the variable, v, by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of v (which is -26): (-26*v) / -26 = 104 / -26 Step 5: Perform the division to get the value of v: v = -4 So, the solution to the equation 72*v = 98*v + 104 is v = -4."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Q: Paragraph: Electron microscopy (EM) should be used in the front line for detection of agents in emergencies and bioterrorism, on accounts of its speed and accuracy. However, the number of EM diagnostic laboratories has decreased considerably and an increasing number of people encounter difficulties with EM results. Therefore, the research on viral structure and morphology has become important in EM diagnostic practice. EM has several technological advantages, and should be a fundamental tool in clinical diagnosis of viruses, particularly when agents are unknown or unsuspected. In this article, we review the historical contribution of EM to virology, and its use in virus differentiation, localization of specific virus antigens, virus-cell interaction, and viral morphogenesis. It is essential that EM investigations are based on clinical and comprehensive pathogenesis data from light or confocal microscopy. Furthermore, avoidance of artifacts or false results is necessary to exploit fully the advantages while minimizing its limitations. electron microscopy, viral structure, viral morphology, viral diagnosis Citation: Zhang Y, Hung T, Song J D, et al.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. As a result of sand mining, Would Qatar's fisheries earn more money or less money than Oman's fisheries? Twenty first century is seeing an explosion of artificial island building. Many countries are building islands in the middle of seas and oceans, which they often use for tourism or for defensive purposes. For example, UAE had build several islands in the Persian Gulf. To build those islands they had to ask Oman and Qatar to export sand to them. Qatar declined to export sand, but Oman agreed. Oman in turn had to mine huge quantity of sand in their own country. Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators. Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information in the paragraph, Qatar's fisheries would earn more money than Oman's fisheries. This is because Qatar declined to export sand for artificial island building, while Oman agreed and had to mine large quantities of sand in their own country. Sand mining causes erosion and impacts the local wildlife, including harm to organisms like coral and destruction of fisheries, financially harming their operators. Since Qatar did not engage in sand mining, its fisheries would not suffer from these negative effects and would therefore earn more money compared to Oman's fisheries, which are impacted by sand mining."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If there's no room between the lock and the frame, you can force it between the door and the frame above the lock, then swipe quickly downward while angling the card toward the frame. This is where a thicker, sturdier card may come in handy.

Q:SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- A 35-year-old father found to be sane when he killed his three young daughters last July was sentenced to three life sentences without the possibility of parole Monday. St. Croix County Judge Howard Cameron said the lives of sisters Amara,11, Sophie, 8, and Cecilia, 5, were each so important that Aaron Schaffhausen had to serve each sentence consecutively. \\"Each child has to be recognized as an individual girl,\\" Cameron said. \\"To make it concurrent would diminish what happened to those young girls.\\" Schaffhausen and his wife Jessica had recently divorced when he came to spend the day with his daughters last year. \\"You can say, 'Three young girls are dead, we've lost their lives, he did it because he hated","completion":"his ex-wife and wanted to make her suffer.' But that doesn't begin to capture the horror of this crime, the tragic impact on this family, and the community who loved these beautiful young girls,\\" said Prosecutor Linda Smith during the sentencing hearing. Schaffhausen, expressionless and dressed in a simple orange prison jumpsuit, showed no visible emotion during the statement or when he was sentenced. The courtroom was packed with family and community members, some of whom openly sobbed during the proceedings. Prior to the sentencing, family members of the victims were allowed to make impact statements, sharing stories of their loved ones and the monumental loss they've experienced. One by one, the grandmother, aunts, and other relatives stood at the podium, battling through tears as they described the pain and emptiness that the loss of the three girls has left them. Schaffhausen's ex-wife, Jessica, also took the stand, launching into an emotional and heartbreaking account of the devastation he had willfully caused for his own malicious reasons. \\"You killed my babies, my everything, in the cruelest kind of way,\\" she addressed her ex-husband directly. \\"You made sure that I will never be able to hug, kiss, laugh with them, or comfort them ever again. You shattered so many lives, and for what? Just to spite me? You'll never know the damage you caused, but I hope you'll never get to sleep another restful night for as long as you live.\\" The defense, in a bid for a lighter sentence, had argued that Schaffhausen was mentally unfit when he committed the murders. They called on psychologists who testified that he had a severe adjustment disorder and suffered from depression. However, the prosecution successfully countered those claims by presenting extensive evidence that showed Schaffhausen was fully aware of his actions and planned the murders deliberately. After several weeks of proceedings and testimonies, the jury eventually found Schaffhausen guilty of three counts of intentional homicide, as well as one count of attempted arson. During the sentencing, Judge Cameron told Schaffhausen, \\"You took three beautiful girls from this world, girls who did nothing to deserve such hatred from their own father. You tried to control your wife and hurt her in the worst possible way, and for that, I'm giving you the maximum punishment allowed under Wisconsin State law.\\" He then announced the three consecutive life sentences without the possibility of parole, ensuring that Schaffhausen would remain behind bars for the rest of his life. In the aftermath of the heart-wrenching case, the community continued to grieve the loss of the three young girls, in mourning for the bright futures they'll never be allowed to experience. Memorials, vigils, and fundraisers were organized by community members and extended family, and plans for a permanent memorial were discussed. Moving forward, the hope is to remember Amara, Sophie, and Cecilia for their joy and brightness in life, rather than the horrific circumstances surrounding their deaths."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Observe it as if it's a totally unique thing, but most importantly, observe your relationship or interaction with the experience and the object. The ways we can learn the most about a subject as well as how to gain the best outcome is to observe our relationships - how do we feel about the experience - is the mind open or closed to the experience? This helps you observe life more completely, rather than being selective, or allowing parts of the mind to cloud the issue. Ask yourself often to identify what you see, as you might not always know, even if you do identify it but a secondary feeling or idea arises, then identify that as well. Once you can identify them, you can explore them, just like once you've identified the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, you can start to put the puzzle together and you can gain practical understanding and skills. Luckily, in essence there are very few cases when the solution to many of our life challenges aren't already within the problem we experience - or in essence, our relationship with the problem. By exploring the foundation of the problem, a solution can be found, or if a solution is simply impossible, then a person can then start to come to terms with accepting the realities of life and finding a silver lining or creative opportunity if they are practical. In life aspects, many of our frustrations, unhappiness, depression and sorrows happen because we aren't looking at things completely and applying our understanding, or observing the issue to understand it. Generally it is wise to go back to the beginning and examine the central facts and test those in relation to what you see. You might be studying to gain an insight into a maths project, but if you are too tired or not interested then it is useful to identify this feeling as this is your relationship with the subject. Sincerity is actually deep in the practice and benefits of understanding. If you are seeing something that is real and can be retested to give the same result, then you will have to satisfy yourself that it is what it is. It might mean consequently you have to let go of other ideas or wishes, but ultimately that is up to you to let them go, because you cannot progress beyond these hurdles. You have to climb over them until you can leap over them. For example, it took a while until you could repeat the alphabet without error. Some people can learn it quickly, but these are very rare people so it pays to keep observing and learning. Very often things can suddenly make sense (like a \\"light-bulb moment\\"), even things you have seen dozens of times before. Through life experience, your mind develops the tools needed to put together pieces of the puzzle, as well as identify different angles and ways that the experience can be improved. The mind is often able to relate what has been seen to prior experiences in order to make connections. By using an inward observation, eventually even this tool and skill gathering becomes apparent.","completion":"This article says that to learn and understand things better, we need to look at them closely and think about our feelings towards them. It is like putting together a puzzle by finding different pieces and seeing how they fit. We can learn better by thinking about how we feel about a subject and exploring the problem. Sometimes, when we keep trying and learning, we suddenly understand things better, like a \\"light-bulb moment\\". Our mind helps us by linking new things to what we already know.

On 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along The Mall, London, when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain-clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason. On 3 July, two days after Francis's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life, John William Bean also tried to fire a pistol at the Queen, but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail.

Q: Paragraph: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has become a global public health emergency. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and its downstream targets are activated in SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected Vero E6 cells and activation of p38 MAPK enhances the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV infection. In addition, weak activation of Akt cannot prevent SARS-CoV infection-induced apoptosis in Vero E6 cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, which is constitutively phosphorylated at tyrosine (Tyr)-705 and slightly phosphorylated at serine (Ser)-727 in Vero E6 cells, was dephosphorylated at Tyr-705 on SARS-CoV infection. In addition to phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in virus-infected cells, other MAPKs, i.e., extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK), were phosphorylated. Although inhibitors of ERK1/2 and JNK (PD98059 and SP600125) had no effect on phosphorylation status of STAT3, inhibitors of p38 MAPK (SB203580 and SB202190) partially inhibited dephosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr-705. Tyr-705-phosphorylated STAT3 was localized mainly in the nucleus in mock infected cells, whereas STAT3 disappeared from the nucleus in virusinfected cells. As STAT3 acts as an activator of transcription in the nucleus, these results suggest that STAT3 lacks its activity on transcription in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells.

The two sentences present distinct ideas and do not necessarily imply each other. The first sentence explains that several Republican leaders are using Democrats as their allies against Clinton to counter the accusations of partisanship. It implies that Republican leaders want to show that the opposition to Clinton's actions or policies is not strictly on partisan grounds, and they involve Democrats to achieve this objective. The first sentence conveys the strategies used by Republican leaders and their intentions. The second sentence claims that Democrats are comfortable with being referred to as allies by Republican leaders in their campaign against Clinton. This sentence assumes that Democrats are either agreeing with the Republicans or do not mind being used as a tool in their fight against Clinton. This sentence focuses more on the Democrats' perspective and views on the situation. These sentences do not entail one another.

On a beautiful morning in 1923, Clarissa Dalloway sets out from her large house in Westminster to choose the flowers for a party she is holding that evening. Her teenage daughter Elizabeth is unsympathetic, preferring the company of the evangelical Miss Kilman. A passionate old suitor, Peter Walsh, turns up and does not disguise the mess he has made of his career and his love life. For Clarissa this confirms her choice in preferring the unexciting but affectionate and dependable Richard Dalloway. At her party Sally turns up, who was her closest friend, so close they kissed on the lips, but is now wife of a self-made millionnaire and mother of five. Intercut with Clarissa's present and past is the story of another couple. Septimus was a decorated officer in the First World War but is now collapsing under the strain of delayed shell-shock, in which he is paralysed by horrific flashbacks and consumed with guilt over the death of his closest comrade. His wife Rezia tries to get him psychiatric help but the doctors she consults are little use: when one commits him to a mental hospital, he jumps from a window to his death. The doctor turns up late at Clarissa's party, apologising because he had to attend to a patient's suicide.

Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Now, I have a new situation: John is learning more about different cultures and people around the world. He noticed that people have different skin colors.

Answer the following question: Article: Settled by the Celts, invaded by the Romans and the Normans, and ruled by the English, Wales' population has regularly changed over the ages. Wales, particularly South Wales, became a melting pot of European nationalities and cultures. At first workers from England, Ireland and the rural areas of Wales rushed into the coalfields of South Wales. By 1911, workers from Ireland, Italy and Spain had joined the industrial workforce there. Many of these newcomers were prepared to work for less pay. But during this period, workers, dissatisfied with regular pay cuts, poor safety, the growing trend of employers to pay workers with tokens , which could only be spent in the company store, returned to the land. In 1891, the rural population of Wales was about 616,000 and by 1911 just over 649,000 people lived and worked in these areas. The rural population continues to grow slowly even today. People from richer parts of the UK, particularly southern England, are buying holiday or retirement homes in Wales. In some areas this has led to a shortage of affordable housing for local people. This, combined with the lack of employment prospects in rural Welsh communities, has started a new movement of people in search of jobs and homes into the towns and cities of Wales and to other parts of the UK and Europe. As so many Welsh people have migrated to other countries over the last 200 years, it's really no surprise that many visitors come to see friends and s -- there were 229,000 visitors in 1998. These visitors strengthen their links to their land of origin and continue to support the Welsh economy. During the hot summer days, about 28% of the visitors visit the countryside and nearly 70% visit the seaside. Question: Why was South Wales so attractive to people in the early 20th century? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Because its coal industry needed a large number of workers.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"Because its coal industry needed a large number of workers.\\" is correct.

These individuals were drawn by the prospect of available work, despite the challenging conditions and insufficient pay most would agree to.

The biggest reason that people tend to attack your home on halloween is that you might be avoiding giving them candy. If you show yourself to be a welcoming neighbor, you might not get vandalized.","completion":"In order to maintain a positive and friendly atmosphere throughout the Halloween festivities, it is essential to create a warm and inviting environment for all visitors, as this will significantly decrease the likelihood of your home becoming a target for pranks or malicious activity. Begin by decorating your front yard or porch with festive and good-natured Halloween decorations, such as jack-o-lanterns, cheerful ghosts, and brightly colored string lights, which will convey your enthusiasm and support for the holiday. Additionally, ensure that your outdoor area is well-lit and hazard-free to create a safe space for trick-or-treaters who may be visiting your home after dark. When children approach your door for candy, greet them with a friendly smile and engage in light-hearted conversation to build rapport and establish a sense of camaraderie. Compliment their costumes and make each child feel special, acknowledging the effort they have put into dressing up for the occasion. Consider offering a selection of treats to accommodate varying preferences and dietary restrictions, such as nut-free and gluten-free options, in order to further demonstrate your consideration and care for the trick-or-treaters. Another way to protect your home from Halloween mischief is to be vigilant and maintain a watchful eye on your surroundings. Keep your ears and eyes open for any suspicious activity or unusual noise, and report any concerning incidents to local law enforcement or community watch groups. Connecting with your neighbors and forming a friendly bond can also serve as an effective deterrent, as it encourages a more respectful and supportive environment within your community, making potential pranksters think twice before targeting your home. When decorating your property, avoid using overly frightening or provocative displays, as this might unintentionally provoke retaliation from visitors or serve as an attractive target for mischief. Stick to light-hearted and fun decorations that will promote a joyful atmosphere rather than one of fear or intimidation. Lastly, securing and reinforcing your home against potential vandalism is crucial. Remove or lock away any valuables or easily damaged items that are within reach of passers-by, such as garden ornaments or potted plants. Additionally, investing in a home security system, whether it be video surveillance, motion-detector lights, or a simple doorbell camera, can act as a strong deterrent for would-be pranksters and provide you with peace of mind during the Halloween season. In summary, fostering a welcoming and friendly atmosphere during Halloween, while taking precautionary measures to safeguard your property from potential harm, will significantly reduce the likelihood of your home falling victim to pranks or vandalism. By treating visitors kindly, creating a safe and inviting environment, and remaining vigilant and proactive, you can ensure a fun and enjoyable Halloween experience for both you and your community."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight. and the situation: James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right. Answer the following question: Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","completion":"A nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal, if they are in the same row of the periodic table. Step 1: Understand the concept of increasing electron count across a period. As we move from left to right across a period in the periodic table, the electron count increases. This is because elements are arranged in increasing order of atomic number. Each element has one proton and one electron more than the element to its left. Step 2: Recognize the location of metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. Metals are found on the left side of the periodic table, while nonmetals are found on the right side. Metalloids are found between metals and nonmetals. Step 3: Apply the concept to a specific row (like the fourth row that James is studying). In the fourth row of the periodic table, Potassium (K) at the far left is a metal, and Krypton (Kr) at the far right is a nonmetal. As we move across the period from K to Kr, the electron count increases with every element.

Although these raids often took place in present-day Lower Franconia, he concealed the whereabouts of those he abducted, hiding them in different castles and changing their locations. He had allies far into Bohemian territory, so he could hide his own whereabouts and elude pursuit. He continued his raids even after 1523, but was eventually murdered in 1531 by a follower. The raids of Hans Thomas Absberg during the period 1519-1530 were documented and fought by the Nuremberg War Office . Feuding at that time was a legitimate means of enforcing one's interests. For the Franconian Imperial Knights, whose importance was waning, it was also a means to combat the power of the emerging territorial states, such as the Bishopric of Bamberg and Burgraviate of Nuremberg, as well their margraviates, Kulmbach and Ansbach. However, the robber barons often misused this means of dispute, because a feud had inter alia to be properly announced and needed a reasonable justification. This misuse spelt the end of feuding as a legitimate arm of policy. It was replaced by an even more effective peace under the Landfrieden. How many years did the raids of Hans Thomas Absberg span?","completion":"The raids of Hans Thomas Absberg spanned from 1519 to 1530, which is a period of 11 years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The Titanic sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York. Hypothesis: The Titanic never finished its voyage","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis that \\"The Titanic never finished its voyage\\" is indeed true. The paragraph states that the Titanic embarked on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, intending to reach New York. However, it struck an iceberg and subsequently sank in 1912. The sinking of the Titanic remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. It was a British passenger liner, constructed by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, with the intention of dominating the transatlantic travel industry. The Titanic was a symbol of luxury and technological advancement, designed to provide unparalleled comfort and speed. Equipped with state-of-the-art navigational systems and engineering innovations, it was hailed as the \\"unsinkable ship\\" during its launch. This tragic incident occurred during the Titanic's maiden voyage, which refers to its very first journey after being launched. The ship commenced its journey in Southampton, England, scheduled to make transatlantic crossing to its final destination, New York. More than 2,000 passengers and crew members were onboard, encompassing a diverse range of individuals from different classes and backgrounds. However, the Titanic tragically never completed its voyage. Late in the evening of April 14, 1912, it struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. The iceberg was not spotted until it was too late to avoid collision, and the ship's hull was breached, causing seawater to flood into the compartments. Despite frantic efforts to save the vessel, the damage was too severe, and the ship gradually sank in the early hours of April 15, less than three hours after the collision. Due to insufficient lifeboats and inadequate emergency procedures, more than 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster, making it one of the deadliest peacetime sinkings of a superliner in history. The sinking of the Titanic marked a significant moment in maritime history, leading to substantial revisions in maritime laws and the adoption of the first International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Thus, based on the information provided, it is accurate to say that the Titanic never finished its planned voyage from Southampton to New York. The ship's intended journey was tragically cut short by the disaster, causing it to become embedded in history as a haunting symbol of the dangers of maritime travel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who was knighted in 1911?, using the article: In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood's state honours were his appointments as Companion of Honour in 1944, to the Order of the Crown (Belgium; 1920), and Officer of the Legion of Honour (France; 1926). He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923). Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The Poet Laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled \\"Sir Henry Wood\\", often referred to by its first line, \\"Where does the uttered music go?\\". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975. His bust stands upstage centre in the Royal Albert Hall during the whole of each Prom season, decorated by a chaplet on the Last Night of the Proms. His collection of 2,800 orchestral scores and 1,920 sets of parts is now in the library of the Royal Academy of Music. For the Academy he also established the Henry Wood Fund, giving financial aid to students. The University of Strathclyde named a building at its Jordanhill campus after him. His best-known memorial is the Proms, officially \\"the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts\\", but universally referred to by the informal short version.His biographer Arthur Jacobs wrote of Wood: His orchestral players affectionately nicknamed him \\"Timber\\" – more than a play on his name, since it seemed to represent his reliability too.

Article: I give two examples as to why intelligent life may not actually exist, though I admit that for me, or even for a physicist who devoted his or her entire life to researching and studying the universe, it's shocking to claim that completely no life exists elsewhere. Keeping that in mind, I'd just like to consider conditions elsewhere in the known universe. You really only need to look at our own solar system or the Earth at certain periods in its own history to appreciate that most places are much worse and much less suitable for life than our mild, watery globe. So far, space scientists have discovered about seventy planets outside the solar. But it appears that if you wish to have a planet suitable for life, you just have to be very lucky, and the more advanced the life is, the luckier you'll have to be. I'm by no means a space observer, but I can recognize some particularly fortunate breaks we've had on the Earth. For example: We are, to a degree, at the right distance from the perfect type of star, the one that is big enough to radiate a huge amount of energy, but not so big as to bum itself out quickly. Had our sun been ten times as huge, it would have burnt out completely after only ten million years, instead of ten billion and surely we would not exist. Too near, everything on the Earth would have boiled and withered away; any further, everything would have frozen over. The universe is a surprising place, and our existence within it is a wonder. If a long and unimaginably complex sequence of events dating back 4.6 billion years or so hadn't happened in a particular manner at a particular time --if, to take just one example, the dinosaurs hadn't been wiped out by a meteor --we might still be a few centimeters long, with whisker and a tail, and you'll be reading this in a cave somewhere. Question: What makes the Earth more suitable for life than other planets in the solar system? - The Earth is the only planet that can receive energy from the sun. - The sun is at the right distance from us and in proper size. - The distance between the planets was neither too long nor too near. - The dinosaurs were no longer a threat to the Earth. A:","completion":"The Earth is more suitable for life than other planets in the solar system because it is at the right distance from the sun, which is also of proper size. This means that Earth receives the perfect amount of energy for life to thrive. The sun is large enough to radiate a significant amount of energy, but not so large that it burns out too quickly. If the Earth were too close to the sun, everything would boil and wither away, while if it were too far, everything would freeze over. This ideal distance and the sun's proper size have contributed to the mild, watery conditions on Earth that make it suitable for life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally.

My wife and I were in Vegas during spring break in March 2011. This was the first show we saw on the first evening after we arrived. I had heard of this group and seen them briefly on YouTube, but when we saw them perform at the Monte Carlo, I WAS BLOWN A-WAY! I was just amazed from the beginning of the Jabbawockeez all the way to the end at how talented this group was, how engaging their performance was. It was one of the most artsy dance crew performances I have ever seen, They were athletic, sometimes funny, their choreography in sync, their music a mix of old school to New Jack Swing to modern mainstream, they took this entire audience to another level of music and rhythm awareness I know I've never been before. At the same time they are an enigma and I get why they wear those masks so that their performances are recognized as a group of people rather than the talents of of one individual. I like that even after the show they still had this air of mystery about them. I think their show was worth whatever we paid to see them, which wasn't an arm and leg. There was nothing bad I can say or anything lackluster about this show and its execution, very fitting for one's first show-seeing night in Vegas. If you are ever in Vegas and you're a show-seeing kind of people, put the Jabbawockeez at the top of your list of shows to see.

Bill dug a small hole and placed the seed inside. Then, he covered up the hole with dirt, and poured some water on it.

Question 2: What happens if I drink one glass of water every 20 minutes? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Hi there, little buddy! Remember, I'm here to help you understand things better. Let's look at each question one by one. Question 1: Drinking a lot of water is good for your body, but you don't want to drink too much at once because it can make you pee a lot, just like you said. When you drink a lot of water, your body wants to balance the amount of water, so it tells your kidneys to make more pee to remove extra water. You should sip water throughout the day instead of gulping down a lot at once. This will help you stay hydrated without having to go to the bathroom all the time. Question 2: If you drink one glass of water every 20 minutes, your body will still try to find the right balance of water. Drinking water regularly is a good thing, but that might be a little too often for your body to handle. It could make you have to go to the bathroom even more than before! You should listen to your body and drink water when you're thirsty, but remember not to drink too much, too fast. Now for your question about if the answers are the same: The answers are similar because they both talk about how your body tries to keep the right amount of water inside by making you go to the bathroom more often when you drink too much water. But the main idea is to drink water throughout the day without drinking too much at once or drinking too quickly. That way, you don't have to go to the bathroom too much, and your body gets the water it needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the man who allowed access for the person that placed a bouquet of red roses bearing a handwritten message? from the following article ? During the 1980s, there was increasing pressure on both the Polish and Soviet governments to release documents related to the massacre. Polish academics tried to include Katyn in the agenda of the 1987 joint Polish-Soviet commission to investigate censored episodes of the Polish-Russian history. In 1989, Soviet scholars revealed Joseph Stalin had indeed ordered the massacre, and in 1990 Mikhail Gorbachev admitted the NKVD had executed the Poles and confirmed two other burial sites similar to the site at Katyn: Mednoye and Piatykhatky. On 30 October 1989, Gorbachev allowed a delegation of several hundred Poles, organized by the Polish association Families of Katyń Victims, to visit the Katyn memorial. This group included former U.S. national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. A mass was held and banners hailing the Solidarity movement were laid. One mourner affixed a sign reading \\"NKVD\\" on the memorial, covering the word \\"Nazis\\" in the inscription such that it read \\"In memory of Polish officers killed by the NKVD in 1941.\\" Several visitors scaled the fence of a nearby KGB compound and left burning candles on the grounds. Brzezinski commented: It isn't a personal pain which has brought me here, as is the case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.

But his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him. Or, by some genius of memory, to recall the fact that it was on this morning young Spear was to be sentenced for theft. It was a charming morning. The spring was at full tide, and the air was sweet and clean. Mr. Thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence. He regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter. He remembered the young man now, and favorably. A shy, silent youth, deft in work, and at other times conscious and embarrassed. But that, on the part of a stenographer, in the presence of the Wisest Man in Wall Street, was not unnatural. On occasions, Mr. Thorndike had put even royalty— frayed, impecunious royalty, on the lookout for a loan—at its ease.

Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans narrowly blocked Democratic campaign finance disclosure legislation in the Senate Tuesday after raising concerns the bill would curb freedom of speech and tilt campaign spending in favor of the Democrats. A 57-41 vote fell short of the 60 votes needed for the Senate to cut off debate on the measure. Republicans unanimously opposed the measure while Democrats solidly backed it. Democrats said the legislation -- known as the DISCLOSE Act -- would bring greater transparency to campaign contributions from corporations, labor unions, and other special interests, which were able to ramp up political spending in the wake of the Supreme Court's controversial ruling in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission earlier this year. OPTIONS: - CNN denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - Citizens United denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - DISCLOSE Act denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - Democratic denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - Democrats denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - Federal Election Commission denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - First Amendment denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - GOP denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - Republicans denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - Senate denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - Supreme Court denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. - Washington denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics.","completion":"- Democrats denied that was their motive, and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. The correct answer is that Democrats denied that was their motive and made certain changes to the bill last week aimed at satisfying GOP critics. This option fits the context of the story, as it is discussing the opposition to the Democratic campaign finance disclosure legislation (the DISCLOSE Act) and the response from the Democratic party. The other options are incorrect because they reference various entities (i.e., CNN, Citizens United, Federal Election Commission, First Amendment, GOP, Republicans, Senate, Supreme Court, Washington) that are not responsible for making changes to the bill.

In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract.

We were headed to Chipotle, but after seeing some great Yelp reviews, we diverted off State Street to try this little hole in the wall taqueria on Gilman Street. Unless you're a big fan of formica, the decor barely rates one star, we're talking dive with a capital D. The place could use a real thorough cleaning as well. Our tabletop was a sticky, but with a napkin, some water and a lot of elbow grease, our eating space became acceptable. The flat screen on the wall featured the Mexican version of MTV which kept my 10 year old very entertained with the plot development of each video. (Boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy is sad) The laminated menu contained primarily Mexican food truck fare (tacos, gorditas, burritos, tostadas, etc.) As a fan of the late, great Up and In podcast, I was overjoyed to see Boing! as one of the beverage options along with Jarritos and horchata. But with ala cart prices from 2 to 3 for many of the items, it encouraged us to sample a variety of items. The cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter was a revelation. Rather than your standard thin layer of shredded jack cheese pressed between a couple of tortillas, this baby featured a crispy masa pocket crammed full of melted queso fresco cheese. She quickly wolfed it down and ordered a second one, proclaiming this version to be far superior to what she's consumed at Pasqual's or Chipotle. I ordered a steak taco, a pork gordita and a chorizo & potato sopes. The steak taco came in a double corn tortilla topped with finely chopped onions, queso fresco and cilantro. Unlike the pungent onions that plagued a recent meal at La Mestiza, these onions were fresher and the smaller dice complimented the meaty goodness of this taco. The steak was well seasoned and perfectly prepared. The pastor gordita, which had the same masa exterior as the quesadilla was also a culinary delight. The crispy exterior was a perfect foil to the melt in your mouth goodness of the pork filling. The chorizo sopes was a solid offering, but it was a little greasy and did not meet my lofty expectations after enjoying the steak and pork offerings. The basket of chips that we were served were average. My daughter did not like having to apply the salsa from a squeeze bottle onto the chips. The salsa was watery and a little bland compared to the other items we enjoyed. Service was a little chaotic. The server that took our order was not very attentive (it was a rare occurrence to get water glasses and / or the chip basket refreshed), but halfway through the meal, we were adopted by another server who did a great job.

Both of these systems use a two-stage filtration process, in which fluid and waste products are first extracted and these are filtered again to re-absorb any re-usable materials while dumping toxic and spent materials as urine. The difference is that protonephridia combine both filtration stages in the same organ, while metanephridia perform only the second filtration and rely on other mechanisms for the first – in annelids special filter cells in the walls of the blood vessels let fluids and other small molecules pass into the coelomic fluid, where it circulates to the metanephridia. In annelids the points at which fluid enters the protonephridia or metanephridia are on the forward side of a septum while the second-stage filter and the nephridiopore (exit opening in the body wall) are in the following segment. As a result, the hindmost segment (before the growth zone and pygidium) has no structure that extracts its wastes, as there is no following segment to filter and discharge them, while the first segment contains an extraction structure that passes wastes to the second, but does not contain the structures that re-filter and discharge urine.

All you need to do is rub a small slice of tomato across any dark facial hair for about five minutes and then rinse off the juices. Place about half a cup of papaya pulp in a bowl with a tablespoon of milk. Work this into a thick paste and then dab it on any unwanted facial hair. Leave it on for 10 minutes before washing it out and see if you notice any lightening. There are no rough guidelines for the amount of these ingredients to use.

Barack Hussein Obama II ( ( listen); born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. The first African American to assume the presidency, he was previously the junior United States Senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008. Before that, he served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 until 2004. Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. From age six to ten, Obama attended local Indonesian-language schools: Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School) for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 (State Elementary School Menteng 01/Besuki Public School) for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother. As a result of those four years in Jakarta, he was able to speak Indonesian fluently as a child. During his time in Indonesia, Obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him \\"a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works\\". In 1971, Obama returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, Madelyn and Stanley Dunham. He attended Punahou School-- a private college preparatory school-- with the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. In his youth, Obama went by the nickname \\"Barry\\". Obama lived with his mother and half-sister, Maya Soetoro, in Hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Hawaii. Obama chose to stay in Hawaii with his grandparents for high school at Punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to Indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. His mother spent most of the next two decades in Indonesia, divorcing Lolo in 1980 and earning a PhD degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in Hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer. Obama later reflected on his years in Honolulu and wrote: \\"The opportunity that Hawaii offered - to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect - became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that I hold most dear.\\" Obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to \\"push questions of who I was out of my mind\\". Obama was also a member of the \\"choom gang\\", a self-named group of friends that spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana. After graduating from high school in 1979, Obama moved to Los Angeles to attend Occidental College. In February 1981, Obama made his first public speech, calling for Occidental to participate in the disinvestment from South Africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. In mid-1981, Obama traveled to Indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in Pakistan and India for three weeks. Later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in English literature and lived off-campus on West 109th Street. He graduated with a BA degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the Business International Corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group on the City College of New York campus for three months in 1985.

The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes.

How do you do this: Carry multiple grocery bags.","completion":"To carry multiple grocery bags efficiently and safely, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Inspect the bags Before you start, take a moment to inspect the grocery bags. Make sure the bags are sturdy and well-constructed to prevent them from ripping while carrying. Additionally, check that the handles are securely attached and not damaged. Step 2: Sort items by weight Organize your shopping items by weight, placing the heaviest items at the bottom of the bags and lighter items on top. Doing so will ensure better weight distribution and reduce the risk of squishing fragile items such as fruits and bread. Step 3: Choose an appropriate number of bags Estimate the number of bags needed to carry your groceries, taking into account their capacity and your strength. It's better to use more bags to efficiently distribute the weight, as various bags may be easier to handle than one overly packed bag. Step 4: Group the handles Hold the handles of several bags in one hand so that you can grip them together. You can do this by threading the handles through your fingers or by using the palm of your hand. Make sure you don't overload one hand – evenly distribute the bags between both hands. Step 5: Adjust your grip Find a comfortable and secure grip on the handles. You can wrap the handles around your hand or wrist for more stability, or hold them with your fingertips for lighter bags. Ensure you can maintain a solid grip on the bags as you walk. Step 6: Maintain good posture As you carry the grocery bags, maintain proper posture to prevent strain on your back and shoulders. Stand tall with your chest up and shoulders back, and engage your core to help distribute the weight more evenly across your body. Step 7: Walk steadily Walk at a comfortable pace, and avoid any sudden movements or excessive twisting that may cause the bags to swing and become unbalanced. Use extra caution when walking on uneven surfaces or when navigating obstacles such as curbs or stairs. Step 8: Set the bags down carefully When you arrive at your destination, set the bags down gently, especially if they contain fragile items. Use your legs to support the weight as you lower the bags, and avoid bending at the waist to reduce strain on your back. By following these steps, you can carry multiple grocery bags safely and efficiently while minimizing the risk of dropping or damaging your items."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If less hydrogen is pressing down on the core, it would have a direct impact on the overall gravitational force exhibited by the star, specifically leading to a reduced gravitational pull. The layers of hydrogen that surround the star's core are responsible for providing the necessary mass and pressure that contribute to the immense gravitational forces the star generates. As the core contracts under pressure, gravitational force increases, leading to an enhancement in the ability to draw objects towards it. However, with less hydrogen pressing down on the core, this process would be less effective, resulting in diminished gravitational forces being generated. Consequently, the star's ability to draw more objects into it would be weakened. Thus, the supposed perturbation of less hydrogen pressing down on the core influences the second effect mentioned (drawing more objects into it) by producing a lesser effect. The star would have a weaker gravitational force, and as a result, its capacity to attract additional objects (including light) would be reduced, limiting its ability to draw them in, ultimately leading to a weaker gravitational interaction with surrounding matter and radiation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pouring them in generously, she folds the chocolate chips into the dough, ensuring that every bite will contain a good amount of chocolaty goodness. After lining her baking sheets with parchment paper, she scoops equally-sized portions of the dough onto the sheets, making sure to leave enough space between them to account for any spreading during the baking process. As the cookie dough balls sit on the kitchen counter, the tantalizing aroma of chocolate and butter lingers in the air, tempting anyone in its vicinity to indulge. She looks at the clock, noting the time and calculating how long it will take before her family's game night begins. Sliding the baking sheets into the oven, she sets the timer for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are golden brown. As they bake, she takes advantage of the time to clean, putting away unused ingredients and washing the dishes. The timer beeps, and she swiftly dons her oven mitts to remove the baking sheets from the oven. The cookies have transformed into perfect golden brown mounds of deliciousness. She transfers them onto wire racks to cool. As the cookies cool, she starts preparing other snacks and drinks for the game night. She organizes the living room, placing coasters, plates, and game pieces on an accessible table. Excited by the thought of a night of laughter and friendly competition, her anticipation fills her with joy. Finally, with the delicious, homemade chocolate chip cookies as the centerpiece, the family game night has all the elements for a memorable and enjoyable evening. The woman can't help but feel proud of her labor of love and the part she played in creating a special bonding moment for her family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has ordered Apple to help unlock an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Rizwan Farook. But Apple has continued to fight the order, saying it would set a \\"dangerous precedent\\". The case will be heard in a federal court on 22 March. Farook and his wife killed 14 people in the Californian city last December before police fatally shot them. The FBI wants to access data on Farook's iPhone but the device is encrypted and can only be unlocked by entering the correct Pin code. Guessing the code incorrectly too many times could permanently wipe the device, so the FBI has asked Apple to develop a new version of its operating system that circumvents some of its security features. Apple has repeatedly stated that creating a compromised version of iOS would have security implications for millions of iPhone users and would set a precedent. The FBI's court order refers to a 1789 law called the All Writs Act, which can give courts the power to force companies to cooperate in a criminal investigation. But in its latest response, Apple said the DOJ was using the law to \\"resolve a policy and political issue\\". \\"According to the government, short of kidnapping or breaking an express law, the courts can order private parties to do virtually anything the Justice Department or FBI can dream up. \\"The Founders would be appalled.\\" But the FBI has said encryption could make smartphones \\"warrant-proof\\". On 1 March, FBI Director James Comey said: \\"From the founding of this country it was contemplated that law enforcement could go into your house with appropriate predication and oversight. \\"To me the logic of that means they wouldn't have imagined any box or storage area that couldn't be entered. \\"It's so seductive to talk about privacy as an ultimate value in a society where we aspire to be safe, and have our families safe and our children safe â€” that can't be true, we have to find a way to accommodate both.\\"","completion":"Apple continues to fight the US Department of Justice's order to unlock the San Bernardino gunman's iPhone, arguing it would set a dangerous precedent and compromise the security of millions of iPhone users."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"Firstly it was the Commission, secondly the speculators and thirdly the Council and, in particular, Mrs Merkel.\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the sentence \\"Firstly it was the Commission, secondly the speculators and thirdly the Council and, in particular, Mrs Merkel.\\" can be translated as \\"Ensinnäkin se oli komissio, toiseksi spekulaattorit ja kolmanneksi neuvosto ja erityisesti rouva Merkel.\\" Here's a breakdown of the sentence structure and vocabulary in Finnish: 1. Ensinnäkin (Firstly) - This is an adverb used to express the first point in a sequence or list. 2. se oli (it was) - \\"Se\\" is the pronoun for \\"it\\" and \\"oli\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"to be\\" (olla). 3. komissio (the Commission) - Refers to the European Commission, which is often simply called \\"komissio\\" in Finnish. 4. toiseksi (secondly) - This is another adverb used to express the second point in a sequence or list. 5. spekulaattorit (the speculators) - This is the plural form of the noun \\"spekulaattori,\\" which means \\"speculator\\" in Finnish. 6. ja (and) - This is a conjunction used to connect words and phrases in Finnish. 7. kolmanneksi (thirdly) - This is a third adverb used to express the third point in a sequence or list. 8. neuvosto (the Council) - Refers to the European Council, which is often simply called \\"neuvosto\\" in Finnish. 9. erityisesti (in particular) - This is an adverb used to emphasize a specific aspect or point. 10. rouva (Mrs) - This is a title used for married women or women of authority in Finnish. 11. Merkel - This is the last name of Angela Merkel, the German politician who served as the Chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021. In Finnish, the name remains unchanged.

Here is a news article: Explaining 'Chain Migration' The president wants to put an end to what he calls the nation's \\"horrible\\" system of \\"chain migration.\\" We explain what it means. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST: President Trump is meeting with congressional leaders at Camp David this weekend, and immigration is at the top of the agenda. Trump has a long list of demands, among them - eliminating the nation's, quote, \\"horrible system\\" of so-called chain migration, a byproduct of the family visa system. Through September of last year, family visas made up roughly 37 percent of all immigration visas to the United States. To better understand just what chain migration means, we turn now to NPR's John Burnett in Austin. John, hey. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hi, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Chain migration - talk us through it. Is this part of the nation's legal immigration system? BURNETT: Right. It's the visa program through which immigrants already residing here can bring their family members over. Some call it family reunification. The way it works is visas are granted according to the family tree. Green card holders or legal residents can petition the Immigration Service to bring over their spouses and their minor children. And once the petitioner gets citizenship, they can apply to bring over parents, married children and adult siblings. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So if I've just become a citizen, I could petition for my sister who's living in another country who's not a citizen to get a visa and come to the United States. But what do critics say? BURNETT: Well, they say it's a system stuck on autopilot - that these extended immigrant families, like your sister coming over, can grow and grow with no regard to who's actually coming. President Trump joins a long line of immigration restrictionists. For years, they sought to reduce the number of family-based visas, and their ultimate goal is to slash the overall numbers of immigrants who come to America. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So proponents, though, say we're a nation of immigrants. You know, what are they worried about? BURNETT: Well, the president claims that chain migration takes jobs from Americans and threatens national security. Remember the Bangladeshi man who tried to set off a pipe bomb in the New York subway last month? Trump points out that he entered the country through extended-family chain migration. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So if Trump and his supporters don't want chain migration, what is the model that they want? BURNETT: Well, what they want - it's called a merit-based scheme. It's similar to what Canada has. It gives preference to job training and English proficiency and education. Trump and his supporters in Congress want to cut the number of green cards from about a million annually - that's the current level - to half of that over a decade. Defenders of the status quo claim it's fear mongering to say that family-based visa system lets in terrorists. They say all immigrants admitted to the U.S. undergo rigorous security screening and that that Bangladeshi subway bomber was radicalized after he got here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So where does the business community come down in the debate over this type of migration? Obviously, there's a lot of interest and concern about restricting immigration in a country right now where there is very low unemployment and many businesses say they need migrants. BURNETT: Exactly. And the pro-business types say we need more immigrants, not less, especially in those tech fields that depend so heavily on them. And they worry that if we reduce immigration, there won't be enough workers for a healthy economy and we'll keep out the people who've given America its genius for innovation. The model they want is to let the market, not the government, decide how many immigrants get to come here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So I've been seeing these TV ads that have been showing - by NumbersUSA, which is an anti-immigration group, and the White House also says this - that a single illegal immigrant can result in hundreds of family members coming in. Is that accurate? BURNETT: Well, the current system does not set limits on how many spouses and minor children of parents a legal immigrant can bring in. It does set caps on married children and adult siblings. And there are also caps just on the total immigrants who can come from each country. For instance, if your sister was coming from Mexico or India or the Philippines, they could wait 10 to 20 years or more to immigrate to the U.S. I should add that a survey published last week by Reuters shows the number of immigrants approved for family-based visas, which is what we're talking about, dropped in 2017 to the lowest level in more than a decade. So even without new laws, the government has already begun to narrow the gate. GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's NPR's John Burnett. Thank you so much. BURNETT: You bet, Lulu. Copyright © 2018 NPR.

The lack of clarity about when and how Viktor and Amalija Knavs obtained their legal residencies raises questions about whether the couple secured their residency through family-based immigration, which President Trump calls chain migration and has said he wants to restrict. Immigration experts said it would have been the most direct, and most likely, way for Mrs. Trump’s parents, formerly of Slovenia, to get their green cards. Their immigration lawyer, Michael J. Wildes, declined to offer any details. “It’s a privilege to help this family, but I have to respect their privacy as well,” Mr. Wildes said in a brief interview. “Immigration is in our DNA,” he added. “We have to take great pride, no matter where somebody hails from, in that legacy.” ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Visas are granted according to relationships within the family tree. Green card holders can petition for their spouse and minor children to join them in the US, while citizens can apply for their parents, married children, and adult siblings to receive visas. Critics argue that chain migration brings a never-ending flow of extended immigrant families into the US without control or oversight. They aim to reduce the number of family-based visas to decrease overall immigration numbers. Proponents of chain migration, however, argue that the US is a nation of immigrants and that the current system strengthens family and community ties. President Trump supports moving to a merit-based visa system similar to Canada's, where preference is given to factors such as job training, English proficiency, and education levels. The merit-based system intends to reduce the number of green cards granted annually, though critics argue that the current system provides thorough security screenings and that reducing the number of immigrant workers would harm the economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: 2). into the moon: The moon has nothing to do with the cow's ability to see the farmer. The moon reflects sunlight towards Earth, but the light still needs to enter the cow's eyes for it to see the farmer. 3). into the sun: Similar to the moon, the sun plays a role in providing light; however, it's the light entering the cow's eyes that allows it to see the farmer. 4). into a bucket: A bucket is not relevant when it comes to the cow's ability to see the farmer.

Gender: The first statement mentions \\"two boys,\\" while the second statement uses the term \\"two kids.\\" It's important to note that \\"kids\\" is a gender-neutral term and could refer to boys, girls, or a combination of both. Without additional information, we cannot know the gender of the children in the second statement. 2. Activity: Both statements involve outdoor activities in a forest. However, the first statement specifically mentions that the boys have an ax, while the second statement says that the kids are gathering firewood. It is plausible that an ax might be used to gather firewood, but the second statement does not explicitly mention that fact. Additionally, firewood can be gathered in various ways without using an ax, such as by picking up fallen branches and twigs. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that an ax is involved in the second statement. 3. Context: The first statement sets the scene by mentioning that the individuals are \\"outside with an ax in a forested environment.\\" In contrast, the second statement indicates that the kids are \\"gathering firewood in a forest.\\" The forested environment is present in both scenarios, but the specific context and surrounding details may vary.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Everyone needs safe drinking water, but about 1.1 billion people have no access to clean water. Most of the world's water is salty ocean water or frozen polar ice. By 2050, the world's population could grow from 6.7 billion to more than 9 billion. All of those people will need water to drink. But the bad news is that some areas of the world are growing drier because of climate change. The total area of the Earth's surface classified as very dry has doubled since the 1970s. Sadly, the precious resource is still misused in industry, in farming and at homes. Therefore, the world is facing a crisis over water. \\"You do the math, and it gets a little scary,\\" says Stuart Minchin, a water expert in Australia. \\"We're waking up,\\" he says. \\"But not fast enough.\\" In southern Australia, farmers have been hit hard. They can't irrigate their fields well enough. The Australian government has launched a 1.3 billion project to improve Australia's irrigation system to stop the crop production dropping further. Australians have serious water worries, but it could be worse. They don't have to fear that when they turn on the tap, nothing will come out. That's the case in India. Many people in New Delhi, the capital, go without clean water for days. City leaders have taken stricter measures to save water. Users pay a very high but affordable price for it. Homeowners who waste water are given large fines. There are 1.9 million people who live in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now it has grown by more than 300,000 people since 2002. But it uses less water today than it did seven years ago. The answer to this question is:","completion":"According to the provided article, which of the following statements is correct? A) The world's population is expected to decrease to 6.7 billion by 2050. B) The Australian government has taken no action to address the country's water problem. C) Due to strict measures, users in New Delhi, India, are given large fines if they waste water. D) Despite an increase in population, Las Vegas uses more water today than it did in 2002. Answer: C) Due to strict measures, users in New Delhi, India, are given large fines if they waste water."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. There's a great deal of material from the Modesty Blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie. Unfortunately, several attempts have been made and they've fallen short of the great potential in the character. So, no, this isn't the Modesty you know from the comic strip (currently reprinted in nice editions from Titan Books). This is Modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip, and from what you can piece together from her back-story, it's accurate. Miramax had the movie rights to the character, with Quentin Tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser. Early drafts of the Miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels, but always managed to leave out some crucial element. Tarantino wasn't happy with any of them, and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed. To the studio's credit, they wanted to keep him in the process, since they knew he \\"got\\" the character and her world. With the movie rights close to expiration, they decided to try a very different approach. The result was \\"My Name is Modesty,\\" a small direct-to-video movie that introduces the character. The movie does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald. These characters are important to Blaise's adventures throughout most of the published stories. What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself. She never loses her composure, and you never doubt that she's in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns. Most of the movie takes place within a casino, which undoubtedly saved money on the production. It doesn't matter. The film does not come across as cheap. Instead, it gives a fairly comprehensive (and believable) back-story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead. Should Miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now, they've laid out the character's background nicely and won't have to spend much time on her \\"origin.\\" I realize the words \\"Direct-to-Video\\" don't inspire confidence, but this film is well worth a look. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is positive. The reviewer appreciates the movie \\"My Name is Modesty\\" and the way it portrays the character, even though it is a small direct-to-video production. The reviewer believes this movie serves as a good introduction to the character and lays out her background nicely for potential future adaptations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In part that can explain the reason why, although we have implemented free trade agreements, they have not been as good as they can become because the Government of Canada has actually impeded and impaired the ability of the Canadian private sector to be competitive with its counterpart south of the border because it has not done much with removing the interprovincial trade barriers that hamstring them so badly. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? we have not implemented fair trade agreements pick from the following. [+] Yes. [+] It's impossible to say. [+] No.","completion":"[+] No. The paragraph provided does not allow us to conclude that Canada has not implemented fair trade agreements. The main issue raised in the text is not about the fairness or equalness of the trade agreements implemented, but rather the domestic interprovincial trade barriers that are claimed to be impeding the Canada's private sector's competitiveness. The paragraph highlights that free trade agreements have been established but criticizes the effectiveness of these agreements. While the speaker suggests that these trade agreements could be more beneficial, the discussion revolves around their effectiveness and not their existence or fairness. The claim made by the speaker is that the Government of Canada has negatively impacted the Canadian private sector's ability to compete because of the continued existence of interprovincial trade barriers. \\"Fair trade,\\" is another complex economic concept with its own set of rules and principles, mainly focused on equitable trade, fair payment to exporters, and sensible environmental practices. From the passage, it can be inferred that 'Free Trade Agreements' were implemented but the effectiveness of these agreements is questioned due to the existing interprovincial trade barriers; No direct or implied statement on 'Fair Trade Agreements' is made. Therefore, based on the information given, we cannot determine whether or not fair trade agreements have been implemented. The idea of the \\"fairness\\" of the trade agreements was not discussed at all in the paragraph; only their effectiveness in light of the interprovincial trade barriers was touched upon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: In Virginia, legal victory for McAuliffe over voting rights for felons RICHMOND -- Virginia’s highest court on Thursday refused to find Gov. Terry McAuliffe in contempt of court over his efforts to restore voting rights to felons. Republican legislative leaders recently filed a contempt-of-court motion against McAuliffe (D) after the governor announced that he had individually restored rights to 13,000 felons and was working to do the same for a total of more than 200,000. McAuliffe’s action came in response to a July ruling by the Virginia Supreme Court, which threw out a blanket clemency order that he had issued in April. The governor has described his latest move as a way to comply with the court’s order while addressing “an issue of basic justice.” But in a motion filed in court two weeks ago, Republicans argued that the practical effect of McAuliffe’s workaround is the same as the original, sweeping clemency order that the state Supreme Court declared unconstitutional. Without comment Thursday, the court denied the motion. “I am pleased that the Supreme Court has dismissed the case Republicans filed in their latest attempt to prevent individuals who have served their time having a full voice in our society,” McAuliffe said in a written statement. “Restoring these Virginians’ civil rights is morally the right thing to do, and we will continue to move forward via a process that is in full compliance with the court’s July 22nd ruling and the precedent of previous governors. It is my hope that the court’s validation of the process we are using will convince Republicans to drop their divisive efforts to prevent Virginians from regaining their voting rights and focus their energy and resources on making Virginia a better place to live for the people who elected all of us to lead.” Republican leaders did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Summary:","completion":"Virginia’s highest court has ruled in favour of Governor Terry McAuliffe regarding his efforts to restore the voting rights of convicted felons.

The Bucket Bear, as it had come to be called, had been roaming through Perry Township, Clarion County, for over a month with a black bucket-like object stuck on its head. The Patriot-News reports that animal rescue volunteer Dean Hornberger planned the mission to free the Bucket Bear with his girlfriend Samantha Eigenbrod after seeing a photo of it on Facebook. Scroll down for video. Blinded: Krissy Elder took a photo of the Bucket Bear roaming the highway and woods of western Pennsylvania and set up Save the Bucket Bear to rally support to encourage authorities to intervene. To the rescue: A group of volunteers conducted an impromptu rescue mission in the woods of Pennsylvania to free the Bucket Bear. The two rounded up a band of volunteers to assist in the rescue and set off for the woods near where the bear was photographed. Hornberger and Eigenbrod had been searching for two hours and were about to call it quits for the day, when they came across the Bucket Bear near the highway. Hornberger approached it and attempted to wrestle off the rubber container, which turned out to be an air bag that likely broke off a tractor trailer. The bear slipped out of his grasp and led the group on a 20-minute chase through the woods towards 'the biggest mud hole in the area,' as Hornberger described it. Once the group tackled the bear, Shawn Balcita pinned it down with his body while Hornberger cut the metal ring on the cushion with a hacksaw. Eigenbrod recorded video of the brave rescue on her cellphone. Brave: Shawn Balcita posted photos to Save the Bucket Bear of scratches from the bear's claws and said he also had a gash on his chest. After Balcita released it, the Bucket Bear dashed back into the woods, freed of its cumbersome bucket. According to Save the Bucket Bear, a Facebook page set up by Krissy Elder, the Pennsylvania Game Commission was contacted but told her they could not do anything while the bear was healthy and 'mobile.' Balcita and Hornberger suffered some scratches from the bear's claws, but otherwise the group emerged unharmed. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax. Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour. But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big. This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast. The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is a hoax. Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant \\"crabzilla\\" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax. 'I don't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.' She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo. 'Crabs with a \\"pie crust edge\\", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.' Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged. The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs, which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep. Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long. Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore. 'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.' The photograph of the apparent 50ft crustacean was originally posted on a blog called Weird Whistable, a collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town. The image has sparked a rash of less believable online images, with Twitter users mocking up their own pictures of giant claws emerging from the water. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A photograph of a giant crab, dubbed \\"Crabzilla,\\" off the coast of Whitstable, Kent, has been circulating online, prompting residents to believe that a massive crustacean is dwelling close to the town's harbour. However, marine biologist Dr. Verity Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, has debunked the myth, asserting that it is most likely a manipulated hoax. Dr. Nye explains that the UK does have large crabs, such as the spider crab, which can grow up to 1.2 meters in size, but they tend to dwell in deeper waters and have a different shape from the alleged Crabzilla. The crustacean appearing in the photograph is similar to edible crabs or Cancer pagarus, which grow to approximately 20 to 30 centimeters in size. Furthermore, the largest crabs globally are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can reach 3.7 meters in size but mostly remain in deep waters. Since the image's release, more improbable pictures have surfaced online, with Twitter users sharing their own snapshots of colossal claws emerging from the water. As an expert in the field, Dr. Nye stated that she laughed upon seeing the photograph, as the possibility of a giant crab of that scale living near the UK coast is implausible. While it is not impossible for new crab species to be discovered, the Crabzilla image remains a visual deception rather than a genuine discovery in marine biology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Product endorsed by Dr. Oz settles with FTC for 3.5 million Dr. Mehmet Oz, known to television viewers simply as Dr. Oz, once touted a natural extract to viewers as helpful in losing weight. On Monday, the company behind the miracle ingredient agreed to pay 3.5 million to settle accusations by the Federal Trade Commission that it used phony science to back up its claims. Applied Food Services had pushed green coffee extract in its advertising as a diet aid. But federal regulators said there was no scientific basis for its marketing. “Applied Food Sciences knew or should have known that this botched study didn’t prove anything,” said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “In publicizing the results, it helped fuel the green coffee phenomenon.” In June, a group of U.S. lawmakers criticized Dr. Oz for his endorsement of the product, calling it careless and disappointing. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., the chairwoman of the subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Insurance, lashed out at a hearing, saying: “I don’t get why you need to say this stuff when you know it’s not true. When you have this amazing megaphone, and this amazing ability to community, why would you cheapen your show by saying things like that?” Oz, a graduate of Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton Business School, said at the time that he’d use a more critical lens before hawking products on his show. “In addition to exercising an abundance of caution in discussing promising research and products in the future, I look forward to working with all those present today in finding a way to deal with the problems of weight loss scams,” said Oz in a statement. But Oz also said his motives were sincere in initially touting green coffee extract. “My job is to be a cheerleader for the audience, when they don’t think they have hope,” he told lawmakers, according to The Hill.

Article: Old Low Franconian or Old Dutch is regarded as the primary stage in the development of a separate Dutch language. The \\"Low\\" in Old Low Franconian refers to the Frankish spoken in the Low Countries where it was not influenced by the High German consonant shift, as opposed to Central and high Franconian in Germany. The latter would as a consequence evolve with Allemanic into Old High German. At more or less the same time the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law led to the development of Old Saxon, Old Frisian (Anglo-Frisian) and Old English (Anglo-Saxon). Hardly influenced by either development, Old Dutch remained close to the original language of the Franks, the people that would rule Europe for centuries. The language however, did experienced developments on its own, like final-obstruent devoicing in a very early stage. In fact, by judging from the find at Bergakker, it would seem that the language already experienced this characteristic during the Old Frankish period.

I read this background article the other day: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. I am facing a new situation today: Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person was less exposed to external mechanical force? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rob was less exposed to external mechanical force in this situation. To explain further, let's first understand the difference in the severity of their injuries. In the new situation, Tammy and Rob both experienced an external mechanical force when they hit a large rock and fell from the tandem bike. However, the impact of this force on each person's brain was different. Tammy was diagnosed with a serious brain injury in the hospital, which as per the background article, indicates that this injury has resulted from a violent blow or jolt to her head or body, causing brain dysfunction. A serious brain injury often leads to permanent brain damage, affecting the individual's ability to talk, control body movements, and may also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. On the other hand, Rob suffered only a mild concussion. A concussion is a milder form of traumatic brain injury caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or body. Its effects are usually temporary and may include headaches, dizziness, or temporary confusion, but generally do not result in long-term or permanent damage. In this case, Rob's brain was exposed to a lower level of external mechanical force compared to Tammy, resulting in a less severe injury. As a result, Rob's chances of recovery are significantly higher and he is expected to experience fewer, if any, long-term consequences from the accident. In conclusion, while both Tammy and Rob experienced an external mechanical force during the accident, Rob was less exposed to it, as evidenced by the less severe injury he sustained - a mild concussion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film shows a scene of a girl being kidnapped from a charity plane by Vietnamese rebels (a U.N. supplies [as in food and medicine] plane) in Vietnam. Then we are taken to the United States to a detention center in Los Angeles where the warden of the center and 6 of the toughest prisoners are hired to rescue the girl, whose name is Gabrielle Presscott, daughter of Jameson Prescott, CEO and billionaire. Warden Toliver and prisoners (by last name only, their first names are never revealed) Butts and Monster (black youths), Lopez and Vasquez (Latino youths, with Vasquez being a girl), and Brophy and Lamb (white youths). The group travels to Vietnam with three days to rescue Gabrielle, spending one day to train and the rest of the days to find her. After winning a battle the group spends the night at a village brothel and has a small celebration, with Brophy sneaking away into the night.

According to the theory of evolution, why do we die? Options are: (i). no (ii). yes The answer is:","completion":"(i). no The following two questions are not the same. They may be connected in some ways as they deal with life and death, but they seek answers to different aspects. The first question, \\"Why do we live if we are going to die?\\" is an existential question about the purpose and meaning of life. It represents the human need to understand and rationalize the ultimate fate of death. This question often arises when an individual contemplates their mortality, purpose, and value of life. Various philosophical, religious, and spiritual perspectives try to answer this question. For example, some may argue that the purpose of life is to achieve happiness, while others may believe that life is a test that prepares us for the afterlife. The second question, \\"According to the theory of evolution, why do we die?\\" focuses on a biological and scientific perspective on death. This question assumes that there must be an evolutionary reason for our mortality. According to the theory of evolution, death is a natural part of life that helps maintain the balance and health of ecosystems. It should be noted that the driving force behind evolution is the survival and reproduction of the fittest, not individual longevity. Species evolve through natural selection, ensuring specific traits that benefit its survival, such as predator evasion, reproduction, or any other adaptive traits, get passed on to the offspring. Death, in an evolutionary sense, helps reduce competition for resources and allows species to adapt faster to changing environments. It also reduces the accumulation of harmful genetic mutations within populations. Evolutionarily, organisms that had reproducing younger and then dying earlier were more successful in passing on their genes rather than organisms focusing on an extended life. In summary, the first question focuses on the philosophical and emotional aspects of life and death, while the second question centers on the scientific and evolutionary reasons for death. They may share some similarities in context, but they ultimately ask for different answers. Therefore, the answer is option (i). no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"No matter how hard I try, I feel that I say the wrong thing or something inappropriate.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I feel like I usually say the wrong thing.\\" is true?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"I feel like I usually say the wrong thing\\" is true based on the premise \\"No matter how hard I try, I feel that I say the wrong thing or something inappropriate,\\" we must first break down both statements and analyze them thoroughly. Premise: \\"No matter how hard I try, I feel that I say the wrong thing or something inappropriate.\\" In this premise, we can derive a few important aspects: 1. The speaker is making an effort to communicate effectively. 2. Despite this effort, they still feel like they are uttering incorrect or inappropriate statements. 3. This feeling is pervasive, meaning it occurs regularly or frequently. Hypothesis: \\"I feel like I usually say the wrong thing.\\" The hypothesis should be seen as a conclusion deduced logically from the premise. Here, the hypothesis is a summarization of the feeling expressed in the premise, focusing merely on saying the wrong thing. Analyzing the two statements, we can draw a few conclusions: 1. Consistency: Both the premise and the hypothesis describe a consistent feeling that the speaker experiences. The premise reveals a continuous struggle to communicate effectively, while the hypothesis simplifies this struggle into a single statement regarding the frequency of saying the wrong thing. 2. Inclusivity: The hypothesis omits the aspect of \\"something inappropriate\\" present in the premise. This omission may result in a less inclusive or narrower understanding of the issue. The premise encompasses both instances of saying the wrong thing as well as instances of saying something inappropriate, while the hypothesis focuses solely on the wrong thing aspect. 3. Emotional Aspect: The premise shows that the speaker is making a genuine effort to avoid such unfavorable situations, revealing an emotional aspect to their struggle. The hypothesis, although it derives from the same struggle, does not explicitly illustrate this emotional component. The simplification can be seen as a factual statement, whereas the premise exposes the emotional dimension. Based on the consistency and the emotional aspect of the analysis, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"I feel like I usually say the wrong thing\\" can be regarded as true in the context of the speaker's emotions and experiences. However, it is essential to note that the hypothesis does not fully represent the scope of the issue described in the premise, as it leaves out the element of saying \\"something inappropriate.\\" In conclusion, while the hypothesis is true in the sense that it represents the feelings and struggles of the speaker, it does not completely capture the entire scope of the issue as presented in the premise. Nevertheless, the hypothesis effectively summarizes a significant aspect of the problem and provides a sound basis for understanding the speaker's emotions and experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Heading into Wednesday, majorities of Americans in virtually every major poll predicted President Barack Obama would come out on top in this year's presidential debates. Even majorities of Republicans and Romney supporters thought the GOP nominee was in for a rough night. But not all of them. At a time when most surrogates were competing in the traditional expectations-setting limbo contest that always precedes presidential debates, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie predicted that Mitt Romney, seasoned veteran of roughly 20 debates within the past year alone, would prevail. \\"Wednesday night's the restart of this campaign,\\" he told NBC. \\"Come Thursday morning, the entire narrative of this race is going to change.\\" As his team had hinted before the debate, he claimed the fact-checking mantle as his own, deflecting attention from a string of previously debunked statements by aiming the truth-stretching accusation at","completion":"his opponent, President Barack Obama. Romney masterfully executed this strategy, catching the President off guard and, in the process, effectively taking control of the narrative. His strong performance in the debate led to a surge in the polls, with many undecided voters now leaning towards the GOP nominee. The shift in momentum was evident not only in polling numbers but also in the public's perception of both candidates. Critics lauded Romney's performance, praising his ability to articulate his policy stances and expose alleged inconsistencies in Obama's record. Meanwhile, team Obama acknowledged the need to recalibrate its debate strategy, vowing to be more aggressive in countering Romney's assertions and highlighting the President's accomplishments. In the end, it was Christie's prediction that proved to be correct, as the landscape of the race changed dramatically in Romney's favor following the debate. The subsequent encounters between the two candidates were more closely contested, with both sides landing blows and scoring points, but the lasting impact of that first meeting continued to reverberate throughout the remainder of the campaign."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

It ran from O Carril, Vilagarcía de Arousa to Cornes, Conxo, Santiago de Compostela. A second line was inaugurated in 1875, connecting A Coruña and Lugo. In 1883, Galicia was first connected by rail to the rest of Spain, by way of O Barco de Valdeorras. Galicia today has roughly 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) of rail lines. Several 1,668 mm (5 ft 5 21⁄32 in) Iberian gauge lines operated by Adif and Renfe Operadora connect all the important Galician cities. A 1,000 mm (3 ft 3 3⁄8 in) metre gauge line operated by FEVE connects Ferrol to Ribadeo and Oviedo. The only electrified line is the Ponferrada-Monforte de Lemos-Ourense-Vigo line. Several high-speed rail lines are under construction. Among these are the Olmedo-Zamora-Galicia high-speed rail line that opened partly in 2011, and the AVE Atlantic Axis route, which will connect all of the major Galician Atlantic coast cities A Coruña, Santiago de Compostela, Pontevedra and Vigo to Portugal.

US baseball player Pete Rose was accused in 1989 of (and he confessed in 2004 to) what, that has made him ineligible to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame?","completion":"Pete Rose, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) player and manager, was accused in 1989 of betting on baseball games, including those involving his own team, the Cincinnati Reds, while he was serving as their manager. He initially denied these accusations, but in 2004, he admitted to having placed bets on his own team, although he claimed that he never bet against the Reds. The scandal began in early 1989 when MLB started an investigation led by attorney John Dowd, known as the \\"Dowd Report.\\" This investigation found substantial evidence that Rose had engaged in gambling activities and had bet on baseball games. Rose's gambling activities not only involved placing bets on other teams but also on games that he was involved in as a player-manager. The Dowd Report collected testimonies from various individuals, including bookmakers and Rose's associates, and revealed betting records, phone calls, and other forms of evidence that connected Rose to these activities. In August 1989, then-MLB Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti placed Pete Rose on the \\"permanently ineligible list,\\" effectively banning him from MLB and making him ineligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. This decision was made due to Rose's longstanding association with gambling and the potential threat it posed to the integrity of the sport. Rose accepted the ban but did not admit to any wrongdoing at the time. It wasn't until 2004, in his autobiography \\"My Prison Without Bars,\\" that Rose confessed to his gambling activities, confirming many of the assertions made in the Dowd Report. Despite his admission and public apologies, Rose's lifetime ban has not been lifted, and he remains ineligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame. Multiple attempts to get reinstated and gain eligibility for the Hall of Fame have been made by Rose, but all have been unsuccessful as of now. The case of Pete Rose and his banishment from baseball remains one of the most significant, controversial, and debated issues in the history of the sport. Many argue that his outstanding on-field achievements should outweigh his off-field transgressions, while others firmly believe that the sanctity of the game and the rules set by the league must prevail, even if it means excluding one of the most accomplished players in the history of baseball from the Hall of Fame."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With most projects, the budget and schedule are the most important part of a status report. Your manager wants to know that the project will be completed on time, and ideally under budget. Choose your answer from: I. It's useful to have one month's worth of planned workaround. A budget budget can provide you with focus and guidance if new project management techniques are presented.; II. You will either have to agree to these terms or include them in your report. For instance, if you are applying for a position in company politics, but your need to keep going to sports matches in campaign reporting, you can list the numbers of supporters you interviewed on your paper.; III. Determine the goals for the project and split them up into smaller goals. For example, if your goal is to produce 1000 t-shirts in 4 months, and you're to give 3 monthly status reports, focus each status report on whether you've produced 250 t-shirts that month.; IV. Accordingly, do everything you can to plan for the project. Outline any expense that you need to work on or use the project for, but write down any other important tasks that need to be worked on.;.

For example, if your goal is to produce 1000 t-shirts in 4 months, and you're to give 3 monthly status reports, focus each status report on whether you've produced 250 t-shirts that month. Breaking down the project goals into smaller, measurable milestones not only helps you track the progress made but also provides a clear and concise way to communicate this progress to your manager. By focusing each status report on a specific milestone, you can easily assess whether the project is on track and, if not, identify the challenges hindering the progress. When you write your status report, make sure to include information about the current status of each milestone, any potential roadblocks, and the corrective measures you are taking to overcome these roadblocks. This allows your manager to understand how the project is progressing and will enable them to provide any additional resources, guidance, or assistance required to ensure a successful outcome. In addition to the project milestones, it's crucial to keep track of any risks or potential issues that may affect the project's success. Be transparent in your status report and discuss these risks, along with the steps you are taking to mitigate them. This demonstrates your proactive approach to problem-solving and shows that you are attentive to any irregularities that may impact the project. Finally, always make sure to include a summary at the beginning of your status report, outlining the key points of the report. This will give your manager a quick overview of the project's current position and allows them to dive deeper into the report details if needed. Remember, a well-written status report can significantly contribute to the successful completion of a project by keeping all stakeholders informed and aligned to the project's timeline, budget, and objectives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What did the innocent man feel after he was accused of committing murder? Options: - fear - great sorrow - die - guilty - own death Explain why a human would choose \\"great sorrow\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human might choose \\"great sorrow\\" as the answer to the question because they can empathize with the intensity of the emotions the innocent man would experience after being falsely accused of a heinous crime. The experience of being accused of murder has profound implications not only for the person's life but also for their mental and emotional well-being. In this context, let us explore the human emotions and the reason why “great sorrow” stands out as a more appropriate answer. 1. Fear: Although fear is a valid emotion that one might experience when accused of a serious crime, it may not completely encapsulate the depth of the psychological impact on the innocent man. The fear could be based on facing trial, imprisonment, or social ostracization. However, fear may not cover the grief and sadness that come from being wrongly accused and having one's character maligned. 2. Great sorrow: Great sorrow signifies emotional pain and distress, often stemming from grief, sadness, and disappointment. In this case, the innocent man's sorrow may originate from several sources. It could stem from the knowledge that someone out there believes he is capable of committing such a grave act, the social stigma and tarnished reputation created by the accusation, and the potential impact on his loved ones. The profound feeling of sorrow might also arise from the potential derailment of his life plans and goals in dealing with these false allegations. Therefore, great sorrow captures the deep emotional pain that may consume an individual in such a situation. 3. Die: While this option may seem a bit extreme, the severity of a murder accusation might lead an innocent person to consider the possibility of facing severe consequences, including facing the death penalty, imprisonment, or social despair. However, this choice doesn't delve into the emotional aspect of the question but rather highlights the potential outcomes in a more literal sense. 4. Guilty: Although the man is innocent, being falsely accused could make him question his innocence, wondering how a scenario such as this could even occur. However, this option doesn't wholly capture the emotional turmoil he would experience and doesn't resonate as deeply as \\"great sorrow.\\" 5. Own death: This response somewhat resonates with the \\"die\\" option, in which the innocent man might be metaphorically or even literally thinking about his death. Emotionally, however, it does not express the genuine feelings of sadness or despair that the accused person would feel. Ultimately, a human would likely choose \\"great sorrow\\" because it captures the intense emotional pain that the innocent man would experience. Though fear, guilt, and the thought of death might play a role, sorrow encapsulates a wider range of feelings that characterize the agony of being wrongfully accused of murder. The immense sadness, disappointment, and despair associated with great sorrow make it a more fitting answer in understanding the emotional turmoil of the innocent man."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Manchu (Manchu: manjU; Mollendorff: manju; Abkai: manju; simplified Chinese: Man Zu ; traditional Chinese: Man Zu ; pinyin: Manzu; Wade-Giles: Man3-tsu2) are an ethnic minority in China and the people from whom Manchuria derives its name. They are sometimes called \\"red-tasseled Manchus\\", a reference to the ornamentation on traditional Manchu hats. The Later Jin (1616-1636), and Qing dynasty (1636-1912) were established by Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) in China. Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. Octagonal drum is a type of Manchu folk art that was very popular among bannermen, especially in Beijing. It is said that octagonal drum originated with the snare drum of the Eight-banner military and the melody was made by the banner soldiers who were on the way back home from victory in the battle of Jinchuan. The drum is composed of wood surrounded by bells. The drumhead is made by wyrmhide with tassels at the bottom. The colors of the tassels are yellow, white, red, and blue, which represent the four colors of the Eight Banners. When artists perform, they use their fingers to hit the drumhead and shake the drum to ring the bells. Traditionally, octagonal drum is performed by three people. One is the harpist; one is the clown who is responsible for harlequinade; and the third is the singer. \\"Zidishu\\" is the main libretto of octagonal drum and can be traced back to a type of traditional folk music called the \\"Manchu Rhythm\\". Although Zidishu was not created by Han Chinese, it still contains many themes from Chinese stories, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Dream of the Red Chamber, Romance of the West Chamber, Legend of the White Snake and Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio. Additionally, there are many works that depict the lives of Bannermen. Aisin Gioro Yigeng, who was pen named \\"Helu\\" and wrote the sigh of old imperial bodyguard, as the representative author. Zidishu involves two acts of singing, which are called dongcheng and xicheng. After the fall of the Qing dynasty, the influence of the octagonal drum gradually reduced. However, the Chinese monochord and crosstalk which derived from octagonal are still popular in Chinese society and the new generations. Many famous Chinese monochord performers and crosstalkers were the artists of octagonal drum, such as De Shoushan and Zhang Sanlu.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Is it used in traditional Manchu folk music?","completion":"Yes, the octagonal drum is used in traditional Manchu folk music.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi, an Ashari theologian and Sunni jurist of the Maliki maddhab, was a prominent Andalusian scholar during the medieval era. Born and raised in the Iberian Peninsula's Islamic region, he spent his formative years studying Islamic theology, jurisprudence, and literature, eventually becoming an influential figure among his contemporaries. One of the key influences on Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi's intellectual development was the renowned Persian philosopher and theologian Al-Ghazali. Inspired by Al-Ghazali's works, ibn al-Arabi sought to reconcile rationalism and mysticism, striving for a balanced understanding of Islamic teachings and the human intellect's role in interpreting them. This endeavor led him to embrace the Ashari creed, a theological school that emphasizes the importance of rational inquiry while affirming the divine attributes of Allah. Throughout his life, Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi was deeply committed to the Maliki maddhab, one of the four primary schools of Islamic jurisprudence. As a distinguished jurist and scholar, he contributed significantly to the development of Islamic law and theology, authoring numerous books and treatises on various subjects. His scholarly work has left a lasting impact on the Muslim world, particularly in the region of Andalusia. Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi passed away in 543H (1148 CE), leaving behind a rich legacy of contributions to the intellectual and spiritual life of Islam. Today, he continues to be remembered and revered as one of the most significant thinkers and scholars of the medieval era, his ideas and teachings still influential among Muslims today. In commemorating this remarkable individual, the color associated with Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi is #b0c4de.

A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.

What is the best way to: To make canvas shoes into closed toe sandals. Available options: (i). Using eyebrow scissors, remove the back of the shoes, forming curved sandal shape on the sides.; (ii). Using fabric scissors, remove the back of the shoes, forming curved sandal shape on the sides.; Answer:","completion":"The best way to transform canvas shoes into closed-toe sandals is a combination of careful planning, the right tools, and some creativity. Here, we will discuss how to use fabric scissors (option ii) to achieve this goal, along with some additional information and tips to ensure success. First and foremost, gather the necessary materials and tools: 1. A pair of canvas shoes 2. Fabric scissors (sharp and precise for clean cuts) 3. Fabric marker or chalk for marking cut lines 4. Seam ripper (optional, but useful for disassembling parts of the shoes) 5. Sandpaper or a nail file (for smoothing cut edges) 6. Fabric glue or a sewing kit (to reinforce edges and prevent fraying) Step-by-step process: 1. Plan your design: Before you start cutting away any part of the shoe, visualize and plan the final look you want to achieve in your closed-toe sandals. This step is crucial in minimizing any irreversible damage. Take into account the current style and structure of the shoes, as well as the sandal shape you're aiming for. You should also decide if you want to keep any of the shoes' original elements, such as straps, laces, or logos. 2. Mark the cut lines: Using a fabric marker or chalk, draw the curved sandal shape on the sides of the canvas shoes. Be precise and symmetrical so that when you make the cuts, the sandals look even and well-designed. If you're uncertain about your marking skills, practice on paper beforehand or use a stencil. 3. Remove shoelaces and other removable parts: Before cutting, it's essential to take out any laces, insoles, and removable elements so that they’re not damaged or obstruct your cutting path. 4. Cutting the shoe: Using fabric scissors, carefully cut along the marked lines you've drawn on the sides of the shoes, making sure to use smooth, steady motions to achieve clean edges. Be cautious and take your time to prevent any unnecessary damage to the shoe structure. 5. Trimming additional areas: Depending on your desired design, you may need to trim other areas of the shoe, such as the heel, tongue, or straps. Use fabric scissors for larger cuts and an optional seam ripper for smaller, more precise adjustments. 6. Smoothing the edges: After cutting all the necessary parts, use sandpaper or a nail file to smooth the edges of the material. This step will provide a cleaner look to your closed-toe sandals and prevent any rough or jagged edges from causing discomfort while wearing them. 7. Reinforcing the edges: To prevent fraying and ensure durability, reinforce the cut edges with either fabric glue or a sewing kit. If using fabric glue, apply a thin layer to the edges and allow it to dry. If using a sewing kit, sew around the edges with an appropriate stitch that complements the shoe's fabric. 8. Reassemble and customize: Finally, reattach any removed elements, such as laces or insoles. You can also take this opportunity to add other customizations like decorative beads or embroidery. With these steps and attention to detail, you can successfully transform your canvas shoes into stylish and unique closed-toe sandals that provide both comfort and personal flair."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This type of respiration occurs in white muscle cells that are full of carbohydrates, which allows for the rapid production of ATP needed for quick, intense actions. Unlike aerobic respiration that takes place in red muscles full of mitochondria and creates ATP slowly over a long time, anaerobic respiration is ideal for sudden and short bursts of energy, providing an advantage during instances like escaping predators or chasing after prey.

Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career. Somewhere along the line, all of that changed. Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982. After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year. The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice. From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today. Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about. It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized. The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October. More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering. One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work. Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission. The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice. The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana. \\"This award came as a real surprise to me.

Let's analyze the given sentence to understand it better. The original sentence states that there is a woman in a brown jacket engaging in the action of taking a picture. We also know that the woman is positioned near two other people during the moment she is taking the picture. However, the sentence doesn't explicitly state that the woman is aiming her camera at those two people, and as a result, we cannot assume that the woman is taking a picture of those two individuals. It's possible that the woman is capturing a selfie with the two people in the background, or they are together capturing a shared experience such as an event or scenery. Alternatively, the woman might be taking a picture of something entirely unrelated to the two people nearby, such as a landmark, an animal, or any other object, person, or scene. Given the lack of explicit information about the subject of the woman's photo, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether \\"The woman is taking a picture of the others.\\" is an accurate interpretation or not. The information isn't clear enough to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the subject of the woman's photograph. To conclude, while it's possible that the woman may be taking a picture of the two other people, we cannot declare the sentence \\"The woman is taking a picture of the others.\\" as a true sentence based solely on the information provided in the original sentence.

Options: - serve food - eat - set table - serve meal - present bill Answer:","completion":"At the end of your meal, the action most in line with common sense that a waiter would do is to present the bill. This is because presenting the bill is the typical task performed by a waiter once you have finished eating at a restaurant. During your dining experience, a waiter has several responsibilities, such as greeting you upon arrival, explaining the menu, taking your order, serving your food, and attending to any additional requests you may have. The waiter's primary goal is to provide the best possible service to ensure you have an enjoyable and memorable dining experience. While all the options mentioned are tasks a waiter might perform, they are not appropriate to perform at the end of a meal. Serving food, setting the table, and serving a meal are tasks that are executed before or during your meal, not at the end of the meal. Eating is not typically a responsibility of a waiter as they are there to cater to your needs, not partake in the meal themselves. In conclusion, a waiter's role at the end of your meal is to present the bill. This allows you to review your charges and make the payment for the dishes and beverages consumed during your visit to the restaurant. This signals the end of the dining experience and is the most logical and common sense action for a waiter to take once your meal has concluded."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the... answer the following question: In which area has excavations uncovered substantial evidence of habitation?

Mr Hawkins said: \\"Once we're assured from the Environment Agency and the Met Office that the flooding isn't going to occur again, we'll then remove the dams that we've got in place. \\"We'll then start work on the structure of the track which, depending on how bad it is, it could take from between three days and five days to fix.\\" Mr Hawkins added flood defences installed a decade ago had worked until this winter - and the firm was now expecting more rain. Problems at the Cowley Bridge junction mean trains are unable to run between Tiverton and Exeter. \\"It happened 12 years ago, but in the past four weeks its happened three times. \\"We did put protection in 12 years ago and it's done us proud up until now. But we are looking at other flood defences now. \\"We do apologise to our customers at this most important time but the weather has affected us.\\" On Saturday, long queues built up at Taunton station as passengers tried to board bus services.

The name \\"Melanesia\\" (\\"islands of dark [people]\\") is one of several toponyms sharing similar etymologies, ultimately meaning \\"land of the blacks\\" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants. The concept among Europeans of Melanesia as a distinct region evolved gradually over time as their expeditions mapped and explored the Pacific. Early European explorers noted the physical differences among groups of Pacific Islanders. In 1756 Charles de Brosses theorized that there was an 'old black race' in the Pacific who were conquered or defeated by the peoples of what is now called Polynesia, whom he distinguished as having lighter skin. In the first half of the nineteenth century Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent and Jules Dumont d'Urville identified Melanesians as a distinct racial group. Answer the following questions: 1.

While traveling 35,000 feet above eastern Ohio, United 93 suddenly dropped 700 feet. Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers. After reading the above, is \\"The number of hijackers\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Which two factors were different between the three other hijacked planes and United 93?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the number of hijackers is one of the factors that were different between the three other hijacked planes and United 93. The other hijacked planes had five-man teams, while United 93 had only four hijackers. The second factor that was different is the timing of the cockpit takeover.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor. A landmark budget agreement that passed in the U.S. House on Thursday faces certain death in the Senate unless at least five Republicans step up to support it – but so far there are no takers at all. The GOP's Senate leaders plan to launch a procedural effort to kill the plan over a laundry list of objections – including a claim that it short-changes military veterans and other government retirees. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin conceded that he needs to find Republicans who will vote for the measure after Republicans announced their intention Thursday night to block the deal. 'We need Republican votes to pass the budget agreement, period,' Durbin told reporters on Thursday. 'We need at least five. And I’m hoping that there will be more than that.' Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and the third-most powerful Senate leader, acknowledged that 'there are not five Republicans who have announced they’re for it.' In fact, no Republican senators have publicly said that they will vote in favor of the agreement that Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray unveiled Tuesday evening. Turtle in the headlights? Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the hot seat as his caucus prepares to fight against the budget agreement that the House passed easily Thursday night. No way, Jose: Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative tea-party darling, said the budget proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it' Their plan would roll back. 63 billion in mandatory cuts from the so-called budget sequester that took effect in March. Some of that restored spending. would be offset by cuts to military and civilian government pensions. Annual cost-of-living increases in most military veterans' retirement benefits would be cut by 1 per cent, an amount that the Military Officers Association of America says could cost a typical former soldier or sailor 80,000 over a 20-year period. The GOP's three most senior senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have announced that they will vote 'no.' Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, all considered top-tier presidential contenders in 2016, are all lined up against the measure. The proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare,' Cruz said Thursday. 'I cannot support it.' Gang of two: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray negotiated a shutdown-averting agreement that could be headed nowhere. Rubio emailed supporters on Wednesday, saying that the agreement Ryan and Murray negotiated over a six-week period 'continues Washington's irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in and placing additional financial burdens on everyday Americans.' House Speaker John Boehner fanned the flames of a civil war inside the GOP by slamming conservative groups that opposed the budget deal -- but it could all be for nought if his Senate colleagues decide to kill it. And Paul said in a statement that the March sequester cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem. Undoing tens of billions of this modest spending restraint is shameful and must be opposed.' Other Republicans who face primary challenges from tea party-backed candidates are also vowing to cast 'no' votes. 'After careful review of the agreement, I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees,' South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement. 'Our men and women in uniform have served admirably during some of our nation’s most troubling times. They deserve more from us in their retirement than this agreement provides.' Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, echoed Graham's complaint. 'I do not support paying for increased federal spending on the backs of our retired and active duty troops,' Wicker's Thursday statement read. 'Congress should not change the rules in the middle of the game for those who have chosen to serve our nation in the military. ... The plan should be rejected.' Other Republicans object to what one GOP Senate staffer told MailOnline is the agreement's 'pixie dust approach to budgeting.' 'We're doing what we always do,' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'We set out a ten-year plan while knowing full well that we have a decade to undo it and shift gears again.' Looking toward 2016: Sen. Rand Paul said the unpopular 'sequester' budget cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem' and should never be rolled back. Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions explained that Democrats will need 60 'yes' votes – on two separate procedural ballots – in order to pass it. The GOP's parliamentary roadblocks will have the same effect as a traditional filibuster without consuming countless hours of Senate time when the measure is considered early next week. Even if Senate Democrats manage to find enough Republican support to pass the agreement, it won't have the force of law. What Ryan and Murray proposed Wednesday is merely a framework for a budget that has yet to be written. Members of Congress who sit on appropriation committees will still be required to craft – and pass in both houses – a final budget bill by January 15. Unless they can pull it off, the federal government will be headed for its second shutdown in three months. Highlights:","completion":"1. A landmark budget agreement passed in the U.S. House but faces challenges in the Senate. 2. At least five Republican senators must support it for it to pass, but currently, none have publicly stated they will vote in favor of it. 3.

Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin is trying to find Republicans to vote for the measure. 5.

Republicans facing primary challenges from tea party-backed candidates are expected to vote \\"no\\" on the proposal. 7. If the agreement passes the Senate, it still only serves as a framework, needing final approval in both houses in January to avoid another government shutdown."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The volcanic rocks on the surface of the Tucson Mountain District differ greatly from the surface rocks of the Rincon Mountain District; over the past 30 million years, crustal stretching displaced rocks from beneath the Tucson Mountains of the Tucson Mountain District to form the Rincon Mountains of the Rincon Mountain District.

The early career of Abe Lincoln is beautifully presented by Ford. Not that anyone alive has seen footage of the real Lincoln, but Fonda, wearing a fake nose, is uncanny as Lincoln, with the voice, delivery, walk, and other mannerisms - exactly as one would imagine Lincoln to have been. Ford, in the first of three consecutive films he made with Fonda, is at the top of his form, perfectly evoking early 19th century America. The story focuses on a pair accused of murder that Lincoln defends and the courtroom scenes are quite well done. The supporting cast includes many of Ford's regulars.

Relevant information from the context includes: - Peter Charanis was born in Greece (indicates his likely knowledge of the Greek language). - He was an American scholar (indicates possible knowledge of the English language). - He was a professor of history at Rutgers University (an American university, suggesting he needed to communicate in English for his job). - Dr. Charanis was long associated with the Dumbarton Oaks research library (further supporting his connection to the academic community, possibly using English). Step 2: Analyze the information and establish connections. Connecting the information, we see that Peter Charanis was born in Greece, making it likely that he was raised speaking Greek. Additionally, his professional life was centered in the United States, suggesting that he must have been fluent in English, especially since he held a high-ranking position in an American university.

Step 1: Identify key terms In this sentence, the key terms are \\"lurid\\" and \\"melodrama.\\" Step 2: Analyze the connotations of each term - Lurid: The word 'lurid' has a negative connotation, as it typically refers to an unpleasantly bright appearance or shocking details. In this context, it suggests excessive or overly dramatic elements. - Melodrama: The term 'melodrama' derives from a genre that focuses on sensationalism and exaggerated emotions. It often has a neutral to negative connotation, as it implies over-the-top emotions or situations that might not be suitable for every audience. Step 3: Combine connotations to assess sentiment When considering both terms' connotations, the sentiment of the sentence would likely be perceived as negative or at least critical. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"of lurid melodrama\\" is likely to be perceived as negative or critical, suggesting the presence of excessive or overly dramatic elements of a situation or narrative."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The first question asks about the correct grammar usage between two given phrases: 'I will appreciate if you..' or 'I would appreciate if you..'. To answer this question, the correct grammar usage is 'I would appreciate if you..'. This is because the phrase 'I would appreciate if you..' is more polite as it is in the conditional form. It suggests that you are making a request, and the action from the other person depends on their willingness to help or cooperate. On the other hand, the phrase 'I will appreciate if you..' sounds more like a statement conveying that you are definitely going to appreciate someone's help, but it lacks the politeness and the conditional element. 2. The second question, \\"How do I correct WordPress mobile grammar errors?\\" is related to fixing grammar errors, specifically on the WordPress mobile platform. This question is not related to the comparison between the two given phrases in grammatical correctness. Instead, it asks for ways to correct grammar errors in a specific context, that is, using the WordPress mobile app or mobile site.

The Colourist is an American rock band formed in 2009, hailing from Orange County, California. The band consists of Adam Castilla (vocals, guitar), Maya Tuttle (drums, vocals), Justin Wagner (keyboard, guitar), and Kollin Johannsen (bass, guitar). They released their self-titled debut album in 2014. Their music style is described as indie-pop, with a combination of catchy melodies, electronic elements, and powerful instrumentals. Given the fact that The Colourist originates from the United States, they are not from Ireland. Muse, on the other hand, is a British rock band formed in 1994 in Teignmouth, Devon, England. The trio is made up of Matthew Bellamy (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), Christopher Wolstenholme (bass guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Dominic Howard (drums, percussion).

Hypothesis: There were Buddhist monasteries in the west of Nara. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Based on the premise provided, we cannot conclude definitively whether the hypothesis that \\"There were Buddhist monasteries in the west of Nara\\" is entailed or not. The premise only tells us Nara had a layout similar to a chessboard, being nearly half the size of China's Chang'an, with the imperial palace located at the northern end and court residences, Buddhist monasteries, and Shinto shrines stretching south. It does not specify whether there were Buddhist monasteries in the western part of the city. To ascertain whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we would need more context and information about the spatial arrangement of the monasteries in relation to other parts of Nara. Specifically, we would need information about the location of the Buddhist monasteries within the city – whether they were concentrated in one particular area, or distributed equally throughout Nara, including the west. If we were to discover additional sources that describe the geographic location of Buddhist monasteries within Nara, we might be able to establish the hypothesis' validity. For instance, historical texts or archaeological evidence could provide further information regarding the distribution and development of religious institutions within Nara. Additionally, studying the city planning approach of Nara in comparison to Chang'an may offer insights into whether there were indeed Buddhist monasteries located in the west of Nara, as many cities during that period followed similar city planning methods.

In 1823, brash naval officer David Farragut boards the Essex and informs its commander, David Porter, that the Navy is commandeering the ship for a top-secret mission. Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link, who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another. Once the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link. Within days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies.

Summarize this article: Saint Is Already A More Popular Baby Name Than North Kim Kardashian and Kanye West got creative, but not too creative, with their new son’s name. After keeping the public waiting for two days, Kim Kardashian broke her silence Monday afternoon on the name of her son, her second child with Kanye West: Kim and Kanye went for popularity this time, at least compared with the name they chose for their daughter, North, who was born in 2013. According to the Social Security Administration’s database of baby names, 32 boys born last year were named Saint. That’s more than the 13 kids born last year who were named North. (The SSA reports names by sex; to be included in the data, a name must have been given at least five times. In 2013, for example, all 20 babies in the data set named North were male, and North West isn’t included.) Over time, too, “Saint” seems more popular than “North.” Santos, the Spanish name meaning “saint,” is even more popular. About 235 babies in the U.S. were given that name last year. North West could not immediately be reached for comment.

How to Tell Someone’s Age When All You Know Is Her Name ||||| The infant boy born unto Kim Kardashian and Kanye West has been named Saint West, the couple revealed on Monday. Saint, not surprisingly, is a relatively rare name. Just 32 boys born in 2014 were registered with the first name Saint, according to records from the Social Security Administration (SSA). Saints first appeared in the SSA records in 1891, when five baby girls were given the name. (The SSA database has recorded the birth, year and gender for each social security application since 1879.) Five years later, in 1896, there was a sudden spike in popularity when 10 baby boys were registered as Saints. Since then, the name has bubbled up and down, but it seems to be experiencing a steady growth in popularity over the past decade. Since 2008, around a dozen Saints have been born each year – all boys. Looking at the data going back to 1940, more than 300 Saints have been born in America. The image below comes from an interactive built by Randy Olson that uses SSA data to analyze US name trends. Americans called Saint.

Read this article and answer this question On 22 December the Pretender landed in Scotland at Peterhead, but by the time he arrived at Perth on 9 January 1716, the Jacobite army numbered fewer than 5,000. In contrast, Argyll's forces had acquired heavy artillery and were advancing quickly. Mar decided to burn a number of villages between Perth and Stirling, so as to deprive Argyll's army of supplies. On 30 January Mar led the Jacobites out of Perth; on 4 February the Pretender wrote a farewell letter to Scotland, sailing from Montrose the following day. Many Jacobites who were taken prisoner were tried for treason and sentenced to death. The Indemnity Act of July 1717 pardoned all those who had taken part in the Rising, but the whole of the Clan Gregor, including Rob Roy MacGregor, was specifically excluded from the benefits of that Act. Another attempt, this time with Spanish support, was undertaken in 1719, only to end again in defeat in the Battle of Glenshiel.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The story begins with a prologue, narrated by Michael Hordern, establishing the Lapine culture and mythology and describing the creation of the world and its animals by Lord Frith, the sun god. All the animals co-exist peacefully and eat grass together but the rabbits, led by Prince El-ahrairah, quickly multiply and overwhelm the other animals with their insatiable hunger. When Frith warns El-ahrairah to control his people, the prince scoffs at him, claiming that his are the strongest people in the land. In retaliation, Frith gives to each of the other animals a gift, turning them into predators, or 'elil' that hunt and feed on the rabbits. However, Frith also bestows upon the rabbits the gifts of speed and cunning, enabling them a fighting chance against their enemies. All creatures may seek to kill El-ahrairah and his descendants but, with their wits and quickness, the rabbits may survive.The film then transitions to realistic animation and brings us to the English countryside of Sandleford. Fiver (Richard Briers), a young runt rabbit with prophetic abilities, foresees the end of his peaceful rabbit warren during an afternoon grazing, or 'silflay'. He exclaims to his older brother, Hazel (John Hurt), that the field they live on is covered in blood, but Hazel acknowledges the image as a trickery of the sunset. Regardless, he agrees to take Fiver to the Chief Rabbit to see if they can have the warren evacuated.

Merman was born in her maternal grandmother's house located at 359 4th Avenue in Astoria, Queens in New York City in 1908, though she would later emphatically insist that it was actually 1912. Her father, Edward Zimmermann (1879-1977), was an accountant with James H. Dunham & Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes (Gardner) Zimmermann (1883-1974), was a teacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the Dutch Reformed Church and his wife was Presbyterian. Merman began to become forgetful with advancing age, and on occasion, had difficulty with her speech. At times her behavior was erratic, causing concern among her friends. On April 7, 1983, she was preparing to travel to Los Angeles to appear on the 55th Academy Awards telecast, when she collapsed in her apartment. Merman was taken to Roosevelt Hospital, where doctors initially thought she had suffered a stroke. However, after undergoing exploratory surgery on April 11, Merman was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma. The New York Times reported that she underwent brain surgery to have the tumor removed, but it was inoperable and her condition was deemed terminal (doctors had given Merman eight and half months to live). The tumor caused Merman to become aphasic, and, as her illness progressed, she lost her hair and her face swelled. According to Merman biographer Brian Kellow, Merman's family and manager did not want the true nature of her condition revealed to the public. Merman's son Robert, Jr., who took charge of her care, later said he chose not to publicly disclose his mother's true condition because Merman strove to keep her personal life private. He stated, \\"Mom truly appreciated [her fans'] presence and their applause. But you shouldn't attempt to be personal--she drew lines, and she could cut you off.\\" Merman's health eventually stabilized enough for her to be brought back to her apartment in Manhattan. On February 15, 1984, 10 months after she was diagnosed with brain cancer, Merman died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 76. On the evening of Merman's death, all 36 theatres on Broadway dimmed their lights at 9 pm in her honor. A private funeral service for Merman was held in a chapel at St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on February 27, after which Merman was cremated at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel. In accordance with her wishes, Merman's remains were given to her son Robert, Jr. Merman was interred in the Shrine of Remembrance Mausoleum in Colorado Springs, Colorado, next to her daughter Ethel. On October 10, 1984, an auction of her personal effects, including furniture, artwork, and theatre memorabilia, earned in excess of 120,000 at Christie's East. The 56th Academy Awards, held on April 2, 1984, ended with a performance of \\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" in tribute to Merman.

Is \\"In the mid-to-late Republican era, and probably much earlier, many of Rome's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult, along with a share of their divinity.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What did many Romans claim in the Republican era?\\"","completion":"Yes, the given statement, \\"In the mid-to-late Republican era, and probably much earlier, many of Rome's leading clans acknowledged a divine or semi-divine ancestor and laid personal claim to their favour and cult, along with a share of their divinity,\\" effectively answers the question \\"What did many Romans claim in the Republican era?\\" by providing an insight into the religious beliefs and ancestral connections of Romans during this time. However, an even more detailed and comprehensive answer would provide additional context and examples to further illustrate these claims. During the Republican era of Rome, which began in 509 BCE and lasted until 27 BCE, religious beliefs were an integral part of Roman society. Many patrician families claimed connections to deities or other divine figures to bolster their social prominence, authority, and legitimacy. This practice allowed them to associate their family lineage with divine blessings and protection. For example, the gens Julia, the family to which Julius Caesar belonged, claimed descent from Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, through their legendary ancestor Aeneas, who was a hero in both Greek and Roman mythology. This connection not only elevated the status of the gens Julia but also conferred an aura of divine favor and power to the family. Likewise, other prominent Roman families held similar beliefs about their ancestors. The gens Fabia claimed a connection to Hercules, while the gens Claudia asserted that their lineage traced back to the Sabine deities Marsyas and Quirinus. Such connections reinforced the idea that these families held a unique and powerful position within Roman society, as they were not only distinguished by their wealth and social standing, but also by their divine heritage. Additionally, these families often established cults or religious ceremonies dedicated to their divine ancestors, granting them further prestige and reinforcing the belief in their divine connections. These cults and religious practices were an essential aspect of Roman civic and family life during the Republic and served to solidify the elite families' positions within the broader society. By claiming connections to divine or semi-divine figures, Roman families bolstered their social status, further distinguished themselves from other families, and legitimized their power and influence. This practice was deeply ingrained in Roman society during the Republican era, representing the intertwining of family, religion, and politics in the pursuit and maintenance of power. In conclusion, during the Republican era of Rome, many leading Roman clans claimed connections with divine and semi-divine ancestors in an effort to secure and legitimize their authority, influence, and status within Roman society. This practice included the establishment of cults and religious ceremonies dedicated to these ancestors, reinforcing the important role of religion in public and private life. As such, the given statement effectively addresses the question about what many Romans claimed in the Republican era, while a more detailed response would provide additional examples and context to further illustrate the significance of these claims."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Use evidence from the fact that heavy rains cause flooding to answer this question: \\"Heavy rains cause flooding which\\"","completion":"Heavy rains cause flooding, which can lead to several long and short-term consequences affecting various aspects of life, including ecosystems, communities, infrastructure, and human behaviors. The evidence supporting this assertion is abundant through the observation of various instances of flooding events around the world. 1. Damage to infrastructure: Heavy rains cause an influx of water beyond the drainage system's capacity, leading to flooding. This can result in extensive damage to roads, bridges, buildings, and other infrastructure. In many cases, the damage may be severe enough to require significant repair or reconstruction efforts, placing a substantial financial burden on governments and communities. 2. Loss of life and property: Flooding, as a result of heavy rains, can lead to loss of life, injuries, and significant property damages. During flood events, buildings may collapse, vehicles can be swept away, and people may get caught in the rapidly rising waters, leading to casualties. Moreover, properties, including homes, businesses, and farmland, can be severely damaged or destroyed. 3. Disruption of daily life: Heavy rainfall and flooding can cause considerable disruption to daily life in affected areas. People may be forced to evacuate their homes, schools and workplaces may be closed, and transportation systems might be severely impacted. This disruption can lead to loss of income, educational gaps for students, and long-term socio-economic implications for affected communities. 4. Impact on agriculture and food supply: Excessive rainfall can cause flooding in agricultural fields, leading to crop failures and harming livestock. This can result in food shortages and price increases, both locally and in areas that receive food imports from the flooded regions. Moreover, disruptions in transportation networks can exacerbate these food supply issues and contribute to food insecurity. 5. Environmental impact: Flooding due to heavy rains can significantly impact natural environments. Floods can displace wildlife, leading to disrupted ecosystems and the loss of habitats for various species. Additionally, heavy rains can cause soil erosion and sedimentation in rivers and other water bodies, negatively impacting aquatic life and water quality. 6. Spread of waterborne diseases: Flooding caused by heavy rains can also increase the risk of waterborne diseases, such as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever. This occurs when contaminated floodwaters mix with drinking water sources or when people are exposed to floodwater, which may contain sewage or other pollutants. The spread of these diseases may result in serious public health concerns. 7. Psychological impact: Flooding can have lasting psychological effects on affected individuals and communities. The loss of homes, possessions, and loved ones can lead to anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other mental health issues. Moreover, the uncertainty and fear of future floods can create long-term stress for people living in flood-prone areas. In conclusion, heavy rains cause flooding, which has wide-ranging consequences on various aspects of life. The evidence gathered from flood events worldwide highlights the severe impact of these disasters on infrastructure, human life, agriculture, natural environments, public health, and mental well-being. Therefore, it is crucial for governments, communities, and individuals to increase awareness and adopt mitigation measures to minimize the risks associated with flooding caused by heavy rainfall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, we have one positive word and three negative words (including two negative words and one neutral intensifier word that amplifies the negativity).

Question: What is Somersets advice? Title: Seven Movie plot: In an unidentified city of constant rain and urban decay, Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) is preparing to retire and leave the horrors of the city. Before he retires, he is partnered with Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), a cocky, young and short-tempered cop from Springfield, a comparatively small town. The two investigate the murder of a highly obese man (Bob Mack) who was fed spaghetti until a kick to his stomach burst him open. Somerset investigates the murder while Mills is given the murder case of Defense Attorney Eli Gould (Gene Borkan), with GREED written in Gould's blood on the floor. Gould was forced to carve a pound of flesh off of his body, and subsequently bled to death. The police captain gives Somerset an evidence container with three slivers of a plastic-like material found in the stomach of the obese man, which he was forced to consume along with the spaghetti. Going to the victim's house, Somerset finds three groove marks in front of the refrigerator and finds that the plastic-like slivers fit into them perfectly. Knowing the slivers resulted from the refrigerator being moved, Somerset looks behind it. He finds the word GLUTTONY written behind the fridge in grease, along with a note containing a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost. Somerset theorizes that a serial killer is basing his crimes on the Seven Deadly Sins, with five more to go.To give Mills and Somerset a chance to get along with each other, Mills's wife, Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) invites Somerset over for dinner. While they are eating, a train passes by on the track nearby, making the building and all its contents and inhabitants tremble: the couple mention that that's why the realtor was so nervous for them to see the apartment quickly. After Tracy goes to bed, Mills and Somerset examine case evidence from the two scenes. They find a picture of Gould's wife with blood painted around the eyes.

Zachary's parents, Alan and Nancy Cowan, visit the home of Michael and Penelope Longstreet, Ethan's parents. Their meeting is initially intended to be short, but due to various circumstances, the conversation continues to draw out. In fact, Alan and Nancy begin to leave the apartment on two occasions, but are drawn back in to further discussion. At first, the couples are friendly to each other, but their respective comments start to hurt feelings, making everyone argue with one another. Apart from fighting among themselves, the couples blame each other about who is responsible for the fight between their sons. Nancy calls the Longstreets \\"superficially fair-minded\\" and Penelope and Michael complain about Alan's arrogant and dull attitude. Everyone also gets irritated with Alan when he accepts endless business phone calls on his BlackBerry, interrupting the discussion, and showing he has more interest in his business problems than the matter at hand. Michael also receives many phone calls from his ailing mother, to his frustration.

The main reason for their meeting is to discuss this serious incident and to discover, upon conversing, possible solutions or ways forward for their children. Alan and Nancy Cowan are the parents of Zachary, the boy who inflicted harm during the fight.

Michael, too, receives plenty calls from his sick mother and is accused of being a murderer by Nancy for releasing his daughter's pet hamster into the street out of annoyance. Not only does the meeting make it clear that their sons' fight isn't an isolated issue, but it also reveals personal and familial problems each pair of parents explore during their meeting.

I read their reviews and the 4.5 star average immediately intrigued me. It takes a lot to earn a 4.5/5 star average on yelp and it made me wonder, it made me ponder and it made me eager to visit immediately to see what all this burger hype was about. While planning an office hours at Lobby's, I spoke to Lobby several times and listened to him explain the attention he gives to his burgers. The incredibly lean meat, the personal attention to each patty, Lobby's commitment to making the patty's from scratch...it sounded like this was a business that was definitely handled with some tender loving care. So the day arrived for me to finally visit Lobby's. The directions indicated that it was in a strip mall. For those of you who might get a little turned around like I do...go towards the grocery store and when you're facing it look to the left and behind you and poof, there's Lobby's! So I walked in and received a friendly welcome from the staff the second my foot entered the store. As I sat there for several hours, I noticed that Lobby and staff treat every customer the same way and each customer gets a personal welcome upon arrival. I also like how they welcome but they don't banter the potential customers to try the food. They let the customer decide for themselves. The decor was retro and cool and I could see the burger and fries being made right in front of me. I glanced at the menu even though I knew that only a burger this visit would do, and I was pleased with the price. Inexpensive. Moving on to the grand finale, the food. I ordered the cheeseburger and upon the staffer's recommendation, I got it with provolone and kept everything on it, especially Lobby's special sauce. The staffer suggested I take some special sauce on the side for my fries and swore by it so I didn't question the man and said OK! The burger and fries arrived and I immediately knew I was in trouble... the gluttony kind. Nestled on a fresh sesame bun and topped with thick and juicy pickles, lettuce, tomato and the special sauce, the patty was cooked to perfection and just the right size. I took one bite and was in cheeseburger paradise and I didn't even have to go to Hawaii! The burger was juicy, full of taste and the meat was lean. The special sauce. Oh my the special sauce. It's not your typical special burger sauce. There was an ingredient in there that made it just the right amount of sweet and perfect for dipping fries. I guess the lesson here is trust the Lobby's staffer! I tried to guess what the ingredients in the special sauce were but Lobby said that nobody has ever been able to guess. So that's a challenge yelpers. Figure out what's in the special sauce and let me know! The fries were crunchy and delicious, but there were a lot of them so if you go with a friend, you might want to share the fries since the burger will fill you up. I can't wait to visit Lobby's again and try the Italian Beef sandwich Donald S was raving about. If it's anything like the burger, I know I'll be in heaven. But in the meantime, I'll just have burgerlicious dreams about the tastiness I experienced with Lobby's Burgers. And now I see why they have such a high rating on yelp. Bravo Lobby!

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the King that a mounted white horse representing him is carved into the chalk hills of Osmington? , can you please find it? Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower. The architect Sir Christopher Wren was the Member of Parliament for Weymouth in 1702, and controlled nearby Portland's quarries from 1675 to 1717.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person following whose death the memorial was abandoned half-finished? from the following article ? Mary Watts died in 1938, and was buried alongside George Frederic Watts near the Watts Mortuary Chapel, which she had herself designed and built in Compton in 1901. Following her death, and with both George and Mary Watts increasingly out of fashion, the memorial was abandoned half-finished, with only 52 of the intended 120 spaces filled. In the years following Mary Watts's death there were occasional proposals to add new names to complete the memorial, but the Watts Gallery was hostile to the plans, considering the monument in its unfinished state to be a symbol of the Watts's values and beliefs, and that its status as a historic record of its time is what makes it of value in the present day.The nave of Christ Church Greyfriars was destroyed by bombing on 29 December 1940. By then the decline in the population of the City of London had reduced the congregation to less than 80, and the parishes of St Leonard, Foster Lane and Christ Church Greyfriars were merged with nearby St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. Although parts of the ruins were cleared during a widening of King Edward Street after the Second World War, the remains of the nave of Christ Church Greyfriars became a public memorial in 1989; the tower is now office space.St Botolph's Aldersgate remains open as a functioning church. Unusually for an English church, because of its location in a now mainly commercial area with few local residents, services are held on Tuesdays instead of the more traditional Sundays. On 4 January 1950, St Botolph's Aldersgate and the surviving ruins of Christ Church Greyfriars were both designated Grade I listed buildings.In 1934, a statue of Sir Robert Peel erected in Cheapside in 1855 was declared an obstruction to traffic and removed.

Solve this instance: PURPOSE The circadian clock gene Bmal1 is involved in cancer cell proliferation and DNA damage sensitivity. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of Bmal1 on oxaliplatin sensitivity and to determine its clinical significance in colorectal cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Three colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT116, THC8307 and HT29, were used. The Bmal1-mediated control of colorectal cancer cell proliferation was tested in vitro and in vivo. MTT and colony formation assays were performed to determine the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to oxaliplatin. Flow cytometry was used to examine changes in the cell-cycle distribution and apoptosis rate. Proteins expressed downstream of Bmal1 upon its overexpression were determined by Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry was used to analyze Bmal1 expression in 82 archived colorectal cancer tumors from patients treated with oxaliplatin-based regimens. RESULTS Bmal1 overexpression inhibited colorectal cancer cell proliferation and increased colorectal cancer sensitivity to oxaliplatin in three colorectal cancer cell lines and HCT116 cells model in vivo. Furthermore, the overall survival of patients with colorectal cancer with high Bmal1 levels in their primary tumors was significantly longer than that of patients with low Bmal1 levels (27 vs. 19 months; P = 0.043). The progression-free survival of patients with high Bmal1 expression was also significantly longer than that of patients with low Bmal1 expression (11 vs. 5 months; P = 0.015). Mechanistically, the effect of Bmal1 was associated with its ability to regulate G2-M arrest by activating the ATM pathway. CONCLUSION Bmal1 shows the potential as a novel prognostic biomarker and may represent a new therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What does Sandy do to make Bill keep their marriage secret?, using the article: The film focuses on the cast and crew of a new TV series called Manhattan, which is shot on location in New York City. Mel Wexler is a successful producer who has become a workaholic since the death of his family in a plane crash. Trying to forget his loss, he throws himself on producing Manhattan. For the lead role, he tries to cast the feared film star Sabina Quarles, who has a reputation of being hard to work with. She initially declines, explaining she is too good for television. However, because of her past with Mel, she finally accepts the role. They soon start a relationship, but he remains suspicious of her constant visits to San Francisco. She is reluctant to explain why she is going there every month, which makes him think she has an affair. Meanwhile, playing her stepson in the series is Bill Warwick, an actor who is a sex symbol. He is married to Sandy, but because of his image, he has to keep their marriage a secret. Sandy was once a great actress, but her drug addiction has turned her into a street prostitute, ignoring her work. He thinks a co-starring role could help her going towards the right path, but she fails to show up at her audition. The role eventually goes to Gaby Smith, a rich actress who graduated from Yale. From the very beginning, Bill is upset that his wife wasn't given the role and as a result, treats Gaby very badly. This makes her very sad, constantly trying to win his trust over., what would be the answer ?

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"To consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"There are less trucks on the motorway this winter,\\" let's analyze it from several perspectives, including grammar, semantics, and style. 1. Grammar: The sentence structure is clear and conforms to the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) pattern. All the words are in their correct form and properly arranged. The only issue that can be pointed out is the use of the word \\"less\\" instead of \\"fewer.\\" Although it is fairly common for people to use \\"less\\" when referring to a smaller number or quantity, it is grammatically incorrect in this context. The correct word to use here is \\"fewer,\\" as trucks are countable objects. A more accurate sentence would be: \\"There are fewer trucks on the motorway this winter.\\" 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence conveys a clear meaning. It communicates that the number of trucks present on the motorway has decreased during this winter season compared to other times or previous winters. The language is simple, and the words are well-chosen to express the intended meaning. Using \\"fewer\\" instead of \\"less\\" would improve the semantic accuracy and clarity. 3. Style: The sentence is concise and uses plain language, which is generally considered a positive feature in terms of style. It is easily understandable and does not contain any redundant or complex elements that could lead to confusion. However, using the proper term \\"fewer\\" would enhance the sentence's stylistic value and formally correctness. 4. Pragmatics: The sentence appears to be a statement presenting a fact or an observation about the number of trucks on the motorway during this winter. It can be contextually relevant and informative, particularly for those concerned with transport, logistics, or road safety. The information provided allows for further discussions or interpretations, such as analyzing potential reasons for this decrease or examining its influence on traffic conditions. In conclusion, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"There are less trucks on the motorway this winter\\" is relatively strong except for the incorrect use of the word \\"less\\" instead of \\"fewer.\\" Other aspects, such as grammar, semantics, style, and pragmatics, are well-executed, resulting in a clear and concise statement. A minor revision to the sentence, correcting the usage of \\"less\\" to \\"fewer,\\" would improve its linguistic integrity even further. The revised sentence would be: \\"There are fewer trucks on the motorway this winter.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This article: Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the subject whose identification with the cathedral itself is emphasized by her monumental stature?, what is it ?

The poll found that nearly two thirds of Canadians agreed with the country's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan, and that the military should be stronger, but also that the purpose of the forces should be different, such as more focused on responding to natural disasters.

But soon the city's most prominent piece of architecture, a \\"gift\\" from Josef Stalin in the 1950s, will be joined by a building that will reflect the spirit of 21st century Poland. Designed by Daniel Libeskind, Zlota 44 is the star architect's first project in the country of his birth. Currently under construction the 54-story luxury apartment building that is supposed to resemble an eagle, Poland's nation symbol, is situated opposite the Palace of Culture and Science and close to one of the city's few synagogues that survived the Second World War. Libeskind left","completion":"Poland when he was a young child, and the opportunity to design a building in his homeland holds particular significance and emotional weight for him. As an internationally renowned architect, he has left his mark on cityscapes around the world, with iconic works such as the Jewish Museum in Berlin and the master plan for the rebuilt World Trade Center in New York City. In returning to Poland, Libeskind aims to create not only a visually stunning addition to Warsaw's skyline, but also a powerful symbol of the nation's resilience and growth. Zlota 44's design, with its inspirations drawn from the Polish eagle, embodies both the rich history and traditions of the country, as well as its ambitious and optimistic vision for the future. The striking, contemporary form stands in deliberate contrast to the austere, monolithic structure that is the Palace of Culture and Science, highlighting Poland's transformation from its Soviet-dominated past into a modern, economically vibrant, and culturally diverse nation. The decision to place Zlota 44 near one of Warsaw's surviving synagogues represents a nod to Poland's Jewish heritage and the resiliency of the Jewish community in the face of great adversity during the Second World War. For Libeskind, who was born to a Jewish family in post-war Poland, the project's proximity to this significant historical site further underscores the personal connection he feels in realizing his architectural vision within the city. Construction of Zlota 44 has faced some challenges, including financial setbacks, regulatory hurdles, and concerns about its impact on the surrounding environment. However, these obstacles have only served to galvanize the determination of the project's supporters, who view the tower not only as an architectural marvel but also as a potent symbol of perseverance. Once completed, Zlota 44 will boast luxurious living spaces, state-of-the-art amenities, and breathtaking panoramic views of the city. The building's ground floor will feature retail and cultural spaces, intended to activate and engage the public and further emphasize the building's connection to the broader urban context. In designing Zlota 44, Daniel Libeskind sought to create a unique architectural statement that would both contribute to Warsaw's rapidly changing urban fabric and provide a meaningful expression of national identity. Through its elegant form and symbolic resonance, Zlota 44 promises to become a lasting testament to the transformative power of modern Polish ambition and the enduring human spirit. It will serve not only as a beacon of progress for the people of Warsaw but also resonate with individuals across the globe seeking to overcome adversity and build a brighter, more inclusive future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options： A. aquarium B. creek C. pet store D. playground E. pond The answer is:","completion":"E. Pond A detailed and long answer to support the selection of this option is as follows: Several factors lead us to believe that option E, the pond, is the most suitable answer to the question. A goldfish is a type of freshwater fish, and ponds are common places where they can be found, either in their natural environment or within ornamental ponds in gardens, parks, and other public areas. Additionally, these ponds often provide the ideal environment for goldfish to thrive, as they contain ample space, natural water sources, and a diverse ecosystem. The four other options, while possible, have their own limitations or lower probability of being the place where a colorful pebble falls on a goldfish: A. Aquarium: An aquarium could be a plausible answer, as goldfish are often found living in aquariums as pets. However, the question's phrasing hints that the pebble is a naturally occurring, colorful pebble, which would be more likely to be found in a pond. Furthermore, aquarium owners are more likely to use specific substrate materials, such as gravel and sand, rather than colorful pebbles. B. Creek: Although goldfish could potentially live in a creek, creeks often contain faster-moving, colder water than ponds, which is generally less suitable for goldfish. This makes finding both a colorful pebble and a goldfish in the same creek environment less likely. C. Pet store: A pet store may indeed have goldfish and colorful pebbles, but the likelihood of a pebble accidentally falling on a goldfish is relatively low. Pet stores usually keep fish in carefully maintained tanks with filtration systems, and it would be unusual for stores to have loose, colorful pebbles that are not already contained within fish tanks or decorative displays. D. Playground: Playgrounds are not natural habitats for goldfish, as they are human-made environments where children play. While it is possible that a goldfish might temporarily be present in a fountain or ornamental fixture within a playground, the likelihood of encountering both a colorful pebble and goldfish in this setting is very low. By analyzing the given options, it becomes clear that option E, the pond, is the most likely answer to the question. A pond provides an ideal location for goldfish and is a more natural setting for the occurrence of colorful pebbles. This combination of elements makes it the most suitable place for the pebble to fall on a goldfish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Select from: 1. no. 2. yes.","completion":"1. No. The two questions you asked are related, but they are not paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase restates the same information in a different way. It's sort of like translating a sentence into a different format while keeping the core meaning intact. Here, the first question specifically asks how to write an argumentative paragraph, which is a type of literary practice aiming to convince the reader about a certain point of view. The second question, on the other hand, generally asks about paragraph writing— a broader term that entails writing a distinct section in a text that discusses a particular point or idea, which can be of various types like descriptive, narrative, argumentative, expository, and more. Let's elaborate these two distinctly: 1. **How to write an argumentative paragraph?** To write an argumentative paragraph, you must follow a specific format and adhere to certain guidelines. - **Identify your topic:** Choose a debatable issue, something that different people could argue about or see in different ways. - **State your position:** Start the paragraph strongly by stating your position. This can be done in the topic sentence, which sets the tone for the rest of the paragraph. - **Support your position:** Use evidence to back up your viewpoint. This evidence could be based on research or personal opinion, but it needs to be solid and convincing. Examples, statistics, facts, quotes from experts can serve as your evidence. - **Explain your evidence:** This is where you interpret the evidence and explain how it supports your viewpoint. - **Refute opposing arguments:** After presenting your argument, acknowledge the opposing side and refute their arguments. Show why your perspective is more valid. - **Conclude:** Restate your standpoint and summarize the main points of your argument without merely repeating the initial sentences. 2. **What is paragraph writing?** Paragraph writing is the practice of organizing ideas into a self-contained group of sentences that centers around a single topic or idea. A paragraph typically consists of three main parts: - **Topic sentence:** It states the main idea of the paragraph. It tells the reader what to expect from the rest of the paragraph. - **Supporting Sentences:** These describe, explain, or support the main idea stated in the topic sentence. They can include facts, statistics, quotations, examples, explanations, and other details. - **Concluding Sentence:** It sums up the paragraph, emphasizing the significance of the information in the paragraph, and often provides a transition to the next paragraph. Now, while argumentative paragraph writing can be a subset of paragraph writing, it is not accurate to say that the two questions are paraphrases of each other. They are asking about different features within the practice of writing."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter). The discovery and isolation of radium in uranium ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, uranium tile glazes accounted for the bulk of the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors. 1.

The record store sold more CDs than vinyl records because","completion":"the digital format had gained considerable popularity among the music enthusiasts due to its convenience, accessibility, and affordability, making it more appealing to them in various aspects such as storage, durability, and versatility. As CD technology gained traction, it revolutionized the way people consumed music by offering a plethora of advantages, which eventually led to its dominance within the industry. Firstly, the compact disc represented a massive leap forward in terms of sound quality, which turned out to be a decisive factor for those who sought immersive listening experiences without the limitations posed by analog formats. CDs enabled listeners to access crystal-clear audio without any interference from external factors such as dust or mechanical wear, which were common issues with vinyl records. This marked improvement in quality played a significant part in making CDs the preferred choice for avid music fans who were eager to explore the full potential offered by high fidelity sound technology. Next, the physical dimensions of CDs made them a more practical solution for both consumers and manufacturers. CDs were significantly smaller and lighter than vinyl records, occupying less space, and simplifying the logistics related to storage and transportation. This made it easier for individuals to carry and maintain sizeable music collections without facing any major constraints in terms of available space. In addition, the reduced physical footprint of CDs translated into more affordable production costs, which ultimately contributed to the lower retail prices and increased sales figures when compared to its vinyl counterparts. Moreover, CDs were a more durable and robust medium than vinyl records, which were quite susceptible to damage due to mishandling or fluctuations in temperature and humidity. The inherent vulnerability of vinyl impaired its longevity, and posed serious challenges for users who were required to adhere to stringent storage guidelines in order to preserve the quality of their music library. On the other hand, CDs were much more resilient to such perturbations, and could withstand the test of time without any discernible loss in performance. This made it a more attractive proposition for purchasers who sought long-term value and reliability when investing in their favorite albums. Furthermore, the digital nature of compact discs offered increased versatility and compatibility with various types of playback devices on the market. At the height of the CD era, users could easily migrate their music collection across an array of players, ranging from standalone home-based systems, portable audio devices, and even in-car entertainment solutions. This seamless integration created a level of convenience that was absent with vinyl records, as customers could now enjoy their tunes on multiple platforms without being burdened by the constraints imposed by the analog medium. In conclusion, the factors contributing to the higher number of CDs sold in comparison to vinyl records at the record store primarily revolved around the benefits of the digital format, which encompassed attributes like superior sound quality, compact size, enhanced durability, and increased compatibility across various devices. These advantages presented a value proposition that was difficult to ignore, and as a result, ushered in a new chapter in the history of music consumption, where compact discs reigned supreme as the preferred mode of enjoying one's favorite tunes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an email with the subject line \\"WestLB\\".","completion":"Subject: WestLB: Restructured Company Updates and Future Opportunities Dear [Recipient Name], I hope this email finds you in high spirits and good health. I am reaching out to provide an important update regarding WestLB or Westdeutsche Landesbank, previously one of Germany's top public banks, and its latest developments since the restructuring process occurred a few years ago. Furthermore, I am excited to announce some of the new opportunities presented by its successor organizations, and how our valued partners can benefit from them. As you may recall, WestLB experienced financial difficulties during the worldwide economic crisis, with the European Commission ordering its restructuring in 2012. Subsequently, the bank underwent significant transformations, which led to the establishment of two separate entities, Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH, to consolidate the operations. This event had a profound impact on the financial competitive landscape, and I want to ensure that you are informed of the latest details concerning these entities. Portigon AG now performs most of the former roles of WestLB's financial services, excluding the banking operations. This company provides a wide range of services, including risk management, IT services, real estate management, and back-office support. Despite operating on a relatively smaller scale than before, Portigon AG still prioritizes service quality and client satisfaction, sharply focusing on meeting the current needs and mitigating risks while considering future industry trends. ERGO Trust GmbH, on the other hand, has taken a more specialized stance in the banking sector. It is responsible for managing the assets of the former WestLB, particularly the NRW.BANK, which acts as Northern Westphalia's development bank. A state-owned entity, it channels financial resources into valuable projects and initiatives such as urban and rural development, environmental programs, infrastructure, and technological innovation. This approach puts ERGO Trust GmbH in a unique position to foster regional growth and expand opportunities across numerous sectors. Now that you are up-to-date with the current state of affairs, I would like to invite you to participate in the upcoming webinar session \\"Embracing the Future: Opportunities with Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH\\". The purpose of this virtual event is to explore and discuss the possibilities for collaboration between your organization and both Portigon AG and ERGO Trust GmbH to capitalize on their respective strengths and services. Our expert panel will also provide insights on the most promising sectors for growth and investment in the region, outlining the policy framework that supports these initiatives.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Throughout the second half of the 19th century, child labour began to decline in industrialised societies due to regulation and economic factors. The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 Factory Acts were passed to regulate the working hours of workhouse children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the \\"Short Time Committees\\" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in 1847 limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days.

American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions. Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south. According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places. Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s. Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. \\"If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability.\\" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons. \\"There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts.

Established academic disciplines often have their own departments, courses, degree programs, research publications, conferences, and professional associations. They usually have a long history and are widely recognized by universities and researchers across the world. Examples of such academic disciplines include biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, history, literature, and psychology. On the other hand, there are emerging disciplines or interdisciplinary fields that may be supported by only a few universities and publications. These fields often combine elements from multiple traditional disciplines, leading to the development of new methods and theories. Examples of such interdisciplinary fields include bioinformatics, cognitive science, and environmental science. In summary, a discipline of study refers to a specific area of knowledge or learning that is recognized and taught within the academic community. While well-established disciplines are widely recognized and supported, new fields may be supported by fewer institutions and publications, leading to differences in their acknowledgement and development."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: It is a plain fact that we are in a world where competition is going on in all areas and at all levels. This is exciting.Yet,on the other hand,competition breezes a pragmatic attitude.People choose to learn things that are useful,and do things that are profitable.Today's college education is also affected by this general sense of utilitarianism . Many colleges students choose Business,Law not Computer Programming as their majors convinced that these professions are where the big money is.It is not unusual to see the college students taking a part--time job as a warm--up for the real battle.I often see my friends taking GRE tests,working on English or computer certificates and taking the driving tests to get a license.Well,I have nothing against being practical.As the competition in the job market gets more and more severe,students do have reasons to be practical. However,we should never forget that college education is much more than skill training.Just imagine,if your utilitarianism becomes the main trend on campus,leaving no space for the cultivation of students' minds,or development of their soul.We will see university is training out well--trained spiritless working machines.If utilitarianism controls society,we will see people lost in the money--making adventures;we will see humanity losing their grace and dignity,and that,would be disastrous.I'd like to think society as encouraging and people regard profit or fame only as a horse that pulls the courage.Yet without the driver picking direction,the courage would go straight and may even end out in a dangerous situation. A certificate may give you some advantages,but not broad horizons,positive attitudes and personal integrity ,which are the wealth you cannot acquire through any quick fixed way.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What ship are the survivors imprisoned on?, using the article: When contact with the USG Ishimura and the Aegis VII colony is lost, the Concordance Extraction Corporation sends the ship USG O'Bannon to investigate, but contact is lost with them as well. The Marine battleship Abraxis is sent next. Despite the carnage of Dead Space, four survivors are found: Nicholas Kuttner, a security officer; Alejandro Borgas, an engineer; Nolan Stross, chief science officer; and Isabella Cho, chief medical officer. The survivors are imprisoned in a holding cell while the ship is en route to the Sprawl, a station built on a shard of Titan. The head interrogator is told by the Overseer he has seven hours to get information from the survivors. Kuttner is interrogated first and gives his account of the events: he, Cho, Borgas, and Stross are assigned by the O'Bannon's commanding officer to stabilize the gravity on Aegis VII. Assisting are soldiers Rin and Sergenko, along with two additional engineers, Borgas' cousins Noah and Omar, a Unitologist. Campbell secretly tasks Kuttner's crew to bring back pieces of the Marker, which are worth millions of credits per kilo. The group land on Aegis VII, which is now unstable. While the engineers work the gravity stabilizer, Kuttner's crew separate. Kuttner finds a Marker shard, which causes a horrifying hallucination, making him murderously unstable.

S., China, Israel, and a crowd of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon. So if and when they plant a flag, does _ give them property rights? A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative public-private working group. He was speaking from his personal interest and not on behalf of the agency. To be sure, the United States aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as 2015, in a mission that would include a long-term settlement. China and Israel, among others, are also working on lunar projects.

Elena happily agreed to share her knowledge and experience with her friend. Elena started by explaining the cultural norms and etiquette in Japan to Felicia. She emphasized the importance of being polite and respectful as these are highly valued traits in Japanese society. \\"In Japan,\\" Elena said, \\"it's crucial to show respect to others in your actions and speech. It's simple actions like bowing when you meet someone, saying 'itoashimasu’ before starting a meal, and ‘gochisosama deshita’ at the end of a meal, or thankfully accepting change with both hands at a store that can make a huge difference in how you're perceived. Using honorific titles like 'san', 'kun', or 'sama' after someone's name is also important. It indicates respect and acknowledgment.\\" Next, Elena emphasized the role of intricate customs tied to specific situations. For instance, she mentioned the tradition of taking one's shoes off before entering a home or certain traditional establishments. \\"You'll notice a change in the floor level,\\" she explained, \\"That's your cue to remove your shoes. And remember to wear nice socks as your feet may be exposed!\\" She also talked about the bathhouse etiquette which includes washing thoroughly before entering the onsen and avoiding the use of mobile phones or loud conversations that could disrupt the serenity. Elena also talked about punctuality, stating that it is highly prized in Japan. \\"Trains, meetings, appointments—all follow a strict timeline,\\" she said, \\"Being late is seen as a lack of respect for others' time. Always plan to arrive at least ten minutes ahead of schedule—just to be safe.\\" She then moved on to discuss the societal norms. \\"Don't stick your chopsticks straight into a bowl of rice,\\" warned Elena, \\"This is something you do at a funeral and is considered very disrespectful if done casually. Also, avoid blowing your nose in public. It's seen as a private act and could earn you some odd stares.\\" Elena also advised Felicia on clothing standards. According to Elena, the Japanese prefer a more conservative dressing style. \\"Avoid revealing clothes,\\" she said, \\"Especially in religious locations like temples.\\" Lastly, Elena advised Felicia on the importance of understanding the language, even if it's just basic conversational phrases or greetings. Although English is taught in schools, not every Japanese will be fluent or confident in it. \\"Knowing even basic phrases like 'Sumimasen' (excuse me), 'Arigatō gozaimasu' (thank you), 'Ohayō gozaimasu' (good morning), 'Konbanwa' (good evening) can be extremely helpful,\\" said Elena. \\"Also, if you can, learn to read the two primary alphabets, Hiragana and Katakana. Many key signs, menus, and directions are written in these scripts.\\" Elena concluded her advice by wishing Felicia an enriching trip, \\"Japan is a beautiful country, Felicia, with a deep, complex, and fascinating culture. It may seem a bit daunting at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll begin to appreciate the subtleties even more. Remember, it's all about respect, politeness, empathy, and understanding.\\" Felicia thanked Elena for her valuable advice and felt much more prepared and excited about her upcoming journey to Japan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A British climber was killed by a falling rock on El Capitan on Sunday, the second death reported over the weekend at Yosemite National Park, officials said. Felix Joseph Kiernan, 28, of London was climbing the east buttress of El Capitan with a partner about 600 feet up the route when a loose block of granite dislodged, park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said. The rock was about 1 foot across and 2 feet wide and fell about 150 feet before it hit Kiernan. A second climbing party below Kiernan called the Yosemite Emergency Communication Center on a cellphone around 2 p.m. to report the accident. Rangers and Yosemite Search and Rescue personnel climbed up the popular route to get Kiernan, his partner and the other climbers, Cobb said. The crews reached Kiernan's body at about 4 p.m. and brought it to Yosemite Valley via helicopter. The other climbers also were taken off the granite monolith. On Saturday afternoon, 19-year-old Aleh Kalman of Sacramento is presumed to have died after being swept off the Nevada Fall, Cobb said. Kalman was hiking the Mist Trail with a church group when he swam into the Merced River, witnesses told park rangers. He was about 150 feet from the cliff when he was swept away by the current and over the edge. His body has not been recovered, and on Monday park rangers decided to scale back search efforts because of rising water levels at the base of the fall, park spokesman Scott Gediman said. Gediman said the high water levels that make it treacherous for search and rescue workers are expected to continue over the next several days. The weekend's deaths are the third and fourth accidental deaths at the park this year, he said. The park averages 12 to 15 deaths a year. \\"Yosemite is a wild place, and we want our visitors to enjoy the park but they also need to make good decisions,\\" Gediman said. The reporter can be reached at (559) 441-6165 or amoreno@fresnobee.com. ||||| A busy weekend at Yosemite National Park saw rare back-to-back fatalities after a man was swept over a 600-foot waterfall and another was struck by a falling rock while climbing El Capitan, officials said. Numbers show that accidental deaths at the park are not up overall compared to last year, and officials stressed that two fatalities in one weekend is rare. \\"It's not very often that this happens,\\" park spokeswoman Kari Cobb said. PHOTOS: Four seasons in Yosemite On Saturday, a 19-year-old Sacramento man visiting the park with a church group stopped along the popular Mist Trail for a swim above Nevada fall, officials said. Aleh Kalman reached a rock in the middle of the Merced River — about 150 feet from the edge of the waterfall — and was swimming back toward the bank when he was caught in a current and swept over. Though Kalman's body has not been recovered, park spokesman Scott Gediman said officials believe it was unlikely he survived the 594-foot drop. \\"It's almost a 600-foot vertical drop; we do believe it's impossible to survive a fall like that,\\" Gediman said. The search was scaled back Monday after high water levels made the effort too dangerous to continue, Cobb said. \\"There's too much water, the wind is too powerful, and the mist is too thick,\\" she said. On Sunday afternoon, a 28-year-old London man died as he attempted to climb El Capitan, the granite monolith that towers over 3,000 feet above Yosemite Valley. Felix Joseph Kiernan and his climbing partner were about 600 feet up the east buttress when Kiernan's partner stood on a rock and knocked it loose, Cobb said. The one-foot by two-foot rock fell about 150 feet before it struck Kiernan, officials said. Another climbing party below the pair used a cellphone to call for help, but Kiernan was pronounced dead when rangers reached him about two hours later. The El Capitan death was the second on the popular climbing spot in as many weeks. A Montana man died May 19 after a rock dislodged and sliced his line, park officials said. Mason Robison, 38, fell about 230 feet before a second line stopped his fall, but was pronounced dead when search-and-rescue teams reached him. Cobb did not have numbers available for El Capitan fatalities, but said most climbing deaths or injuries result from problems with gear. Rock fall-related incidents are \\"very uncommon,\\" she said. \\"It doesn't happen every year,\\" she said. The weekend deaths mark the third and fourth accidental fatalities at the park this year, Cobb said, along with three natural deaths. The park typically sees between 12 and 15 deaths per year, with 7 or 8 considered accidental. \\"It's definitely hard,\\" Cobb said of the timing. \\"But we look at these as opportunities to teach visitors how to come to Yosemite to be safe.… It really does allow us to get that safety message even further than we would.\\" kate.mather@latimes.com ||||| Climber killed on Yosemite's El Capitan Photo: Michael Maloney, The Chronicle Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Image 1 of 3 El Capitan, Yosemite in morning light.

The two climbers, both from London, were about 600 feet up on the popular East Buttress route around 2 p.m. Sunday when one of the men dislodged the rock, said park spokeswoman Kari Cobb. The rock, measuring about 1 foot by 2 feet by 2 feet, fell 150 feet and hit the man's climbing partner, Felix Joseph Kiernan. Other climbers used cell phones to call for help, and rescue crews who ascended the route reached Kiernan around 4 p.m., Cobb said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Latest news videos Kiernan was the second climber killed on El Capitan in less than two weeks. On May 20, a Montana man, 38-year-old Mason Robison, died on a part of the cliff known as the Muir Wall when a chunk of rock to which he was attached cracked loose. Robison fell 230 feet and came to a jerking halt at the end of his haul line. Kiernan's death was the second tragedy in the park over the weekend. On Saturday, Aleh Kalman, 19, of Sacramento was swept away while swimming in the Merced River upstream of Nevada Fall, which drops 594 feet. Crews searched the base of the waterfall Saturday and Sunday without finding his body. They called off the operation Monday because of rising waters, Cobb said. Kalman had been cooling off in the river Saturday afternoon after hiking the Mist Trail with his church group.

Mason Robison, 38, of Columbia Falls, Mont., was killed after a rock dislodged and severed his rope as he and a partner were about 2,300 feet above the Yosemite Valley floor, Yosemite spokeswoman Kari Cobb said Monday. The two climbers were about 600 feet from the summit around 9:15 a.m. Sunday when Robison put a piece of gear into what's called a \\"flake,\\" or a deep crack in a large rock that runs along the slope, and it dislodged and severed his line. Robison fell about 230 feet, with a second line eventually stopping his fall but leaving him dangling and hanging motionless. A park helicopter flew rangers and search-and-rescue teams to the summit of El Capitan, where rangers, described by Cobb as \\"highly trained\\" in cliff rescues, rappelled down to reach Robison and his climbing partner. Robison was pronounced at the scene. His partner, who has not been named, was not hurt. El Capitan is a favorite climbing area for experienced rock climbers. Rising more than 3,000 feet above the valley below, it is the largest monolith of granite in the world, according to Yosemite's website. Robison's death is the second accidental death at the park this year, Cobb said.

It also claimed the guidelines would make no difference to wildlife caught up in any future incident. The UK Department of Energy and Climate Change ordered a review of regulations in light of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010. The resulting Maitland Review was published in December 2011. In announcing the government response to the review last month, UK Energy Minister John Hayes said it was \\"vital\\" that oil and gas activities met \\"the highest possible standards of safety and environmental protection\\". Under the new guidance, UK offshore oil and gas firms will need to show they are able to pay for an incident which occurs during a specific operation. The guidelines suggest existing insurance cover remains broadly appropriate for many operators, but call for increased levels of cover from explorers in more difficult waters, where the cost of a spill could be greater. Lang Banks, of WWF Scotland, said: \\"While it's only right that oil and gas explorers should be forced to be insured to levels high enough to cover the costs of capping and clean-up, these new rules will do little to prevent future spills. \\"Total's Elgin and Shell's Gannet Alpha platforms were all insured but it still didn't prevent accidents at those facilities. \\"Any level of insurance cover is meaningless to the thousands of marine birds, mammals and other wildlife that would be wiped out by a single deepwater oil spill.\\" He added: \\"The only way to prevent future spills and accidents is to end our addiction to oil, stop giving tax breaks to the oil industry and stop exploration for new oil and gas in dangerous deepwater locations.\\" Summary:","completion":"The UK government has announced new guidelines requiring offshore oil and gas firms to demonstrate their financial responsibility for drilling operations before being granted a license.

Background: The Cult are a British rock band formed in 1983. Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". Context: In 1991, Astbury and Duffy were writing again for their next album. During the demo recordings, Todd Hoffman and James Kottak played bass and drums respectively. During the actual album recording sessions, Curry was recruited again to play drums, with Charley Drayton on bass, and various other performers. Astbury and Duffy's working relationship had disintegrated by that time, with the two men reportedly rarely even being in the studio together during recording. The resulting album Ceremony was released to mixed responses. The album climbed to US No. 34, but sales were not as impressive as the previous three records, only selling around one million copies worldwide. Only two official singles were released from the record: \\"Wild Hearted Son\\" (UK No. 34, Canada No. 41) and \\"Heart of Soul\\" (UK No. 50), although \\"White\\" was released as a single only in Canada, \\"Sweet Salvation\\" was released as a single (as \\"Dulce Salvacion\\") in Argentina in 1992, and the title track \\"Ceremony\\" was released in Spain. The Cult's Ceremonial Stomp tour went through Europe in 1991 and North America in 1992. In 1991 the Cult played a show at the Marquee Club in London, which was recorded and released in February 1993, packaged with some vinyl UK copies of their first greatest hits release. Only a handful of CD copies of it were ever manufactured originally, however it was subsequently reissued on CD in 1999. An incomplete bootleg video of this show is also in circulation. The band were sued by the parents of the Native American boy pictured on the cover of Ceremony, for alleged exploitation and for the unauthorized use of the child's image. This image of the boy is also burned in the video for \\"Wild Hearted Son\\". This lawsuit delayed the release of Ceremony in many countries including South Korea and Thailand, which did not see the record's release until late 1992, and it was unreleased in Turkey until the Cult played several shows in Istanbul in June 1993. A world tour followed with backing from future Thin Lizzy drummer Michael Lee and bassist Kinley Wolfe, and keyboardist John Sinclair returning one last time, and the Gathering of the Tribes moved to the UK. Here artists such as Pearl Jam performed. The warm-up gig to the show, in a small nightclub, was dedicated to the memory of Nigel Preston, who had died a few weeks earlier at the age of 31. Following the release of the single \\"The Witch\\" (#9 in Australia) and the performance of a song for the 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie soundtrack entitled \\"Zap City\\", produced by Steve Brown and originally a B-side to \\"Lil' Devil\\", two volumes of remixes of \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", called Sanctuary Mixes MCMXCIII, volumes one and two, and in support of Pure Cult: for Rockers, Ravers, Lovers, and Sinners, a greatest hits compilation which debuted at No. 1 on the British charts and later went to number one in Portugal, Astbury and Duffy fired the \\"backing band\\" and recruited Craig Adams (the Mission) and Scott Garrett for performances across Europe in 1993, with some shows featuring Mike Dimkich on rhythm guitar.

Here's how I arrived at this conclusion: 1. The sentence has two main parts: \\"New York's finest\\" and \\"a nicely understated expression of the grief\\". 2. The phrase \\"New York's finest\\" is typically used to refer to the police department in New York City, and its use here likely refers to something or someone that is considered to be among the best in New York City. Thus, this phrase carries a positive sentiment. 3. The phrase \\"a nicely understated expression of the grief\\" seems to refer to a moderate or restrained expression of grief that the speaker finds effective or appropriate. The word \\"nicely\\" is a positive qualifier, indicating that the speaker approves of this measure of restraint. Therefore, this phrase also has a positive sentiment. Since both key phrases have a positive sentiment, the overall sentiment of the sentence is likewise positive.

The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its \\"old\\" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage.

The sentence \\"We rummaged through the desk for papers.\\" is linguistically acceptable. In this sentence, the structure, grammar, and word choices are used correctly to convey a clear and meaningful message.

Subject: \\"We\\" - The subject of the sentence refers to the person or people who are performing the action. In this case, \\"we\\" is a pronoun that collectively refers to the speaker and at least one other person participating in the action. 2. Verb: \\"rummaged\\" - The verb in the sentence describes the action being performed by the subject. \\"Rummage\\" is a transitive verb that means to search unsystematically and hastily through a mass or receptacle. Here, it is used in the past tense to indicate that the action has already occurred. 3. Prepositional phrase: \\"through the desk\\" - This phrase provides more information about where the action took place. The preposition \\"through\\" demonstrates a spatial relationship, signifying movement within or by way of the desk. 4. Prepositional phrase: \\"for papers\\" - This last part of the sentence gives further context to the purpose of the action. The preposition \\"for\\" indicates the reason or motive behind the rummaging, which is performed in search of papers.

On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.By noon the next day they had covered 311 miles (501 km) from the Cape Denison hut. Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second. In his diary that night, Mertz recounted: Around 1 pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out \\"crevasse!\\", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge. Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse 11 feet (3.4 m) wide with straight, ice walls. On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion. They measured the distance to the ledge as 150 feet (46 m), too far for their ropes to reach. \\"Dog ceased to moan shortly\\", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. \\"We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often. It is only when we can notsee perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are. People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly. People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too. Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them. When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they can not see it any more, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark.

Sam decided to get cleaned up in the shower instead of the bath because the","completion":"bath takes longer and uses more water. He figured that a shower would be a more efficient and environmentally friendly option for his daily routine. Sam turned on the water, adjusting it to his preferred temperature, and stepped inside the shower. Step 1: Sam gathers all the necessary shower supplies Before starting the shower, Sam collected his shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and a fresh towel. By having everything within reach, he ensured a smoother and more efficient showering experience. Step 2: Sam rinses body and hair Once inside the shower, he let the warm water cascade over his body and hair, relaxing him and allowing any accumulated dirt and sweat to begin loosening. This initial rinse also helped to prepare his hair and skin for the subsequent cleansing stages. Step 3: Sam washes his hair Now that his hair was wet, Sam applied an appropriate amount of shampoo to his palm, lathering it up by rubbing his hands together. He then massaged the lather into his hair and scalp, removing dirt, oil, and any product residue. This step took about 2-3 minutes, during which Sam made sure to cover all areas of his scalp, ensuring a thorough clean. Step 4: Sam rinses off the shampoo Sam then placed his head under the water, allowing the shampoo to wash away. He was careful to keep his eyes closed, protecting them from any soap or water running down his face. He continued rinsing until all traces of shampoo were gone, and his hair felt clean and free of residue. Step 5: Sam conditions his hair Wanting to keep his hair soft and well-nourished, Sam applied conditioner next. Focusing on the mid-lengths and ends of his hair, he distributed the product evenly and gave it a few minutes to penetrate and moisturize the hair shafts. This step is essential for maintaining the health and appearance of one's hair. Step 6: Sam washes his body While the conditioner worked its magic, Sam turned his attention to his body. Using a sponge or loofah, he squeezed a generous amount of body wash onto it and scrubbed his body with gentle, circular motions. This cleansed his skin while also providing a mild exfoliation, removing dead skin cells and leaving his body feeling refreshed and invigorated. Step 7: Sam rinses off Once Sam felt satisfied with the cleanliness of his body, he rinsed off the body wash and went back to rinsing the conditioner from his hair. Thoroughly rinsed and feeling refreshed, he turned off the water, stepped out of the shower, and grabbed his towel. Step 8: Sam dries off Finally, using the clean towel, he patted himself dry, making sure to remove any excess moisture. Drying off properly is crucial, as lingering dampness can lead to skin irritation or fungal infections. In conclusion, Sam opted for a shower as a quicker and more eco-friendly alternative to a bath. By following these steps, he successfully completed his cleansing routine, leaving him feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.

Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s.

It clearly states that they are both wearing \\"red shirts\\". Therefore, it can be confidently deduced that both boys are wearing shirts that are of the same color, viz., red. 3. \\"Sharing a lawn chair together\\" - This part of the statement describes the action or situation that the two boys are participating in. They have decided to share a single lawn chair between them, which implies that they are both seated on it at the same time. Taking all these elements into consideration, it is evident that the two boys in the scenario are not only sharing a lawn chair, but are also wearing shirts of the same color. Consequently, the answer to the question is affirmative: Yes, they are in the same color shirt, which, in this case, happens to be red."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) is designed to protect against threats from North Korea. The move to begin installing the system comes a day after the North launched four ballistic missiles, breaking international sanctions. But the US-South Korean arrangement has angered many on the Korean peninsula and around the region, including China. South Korean media said operations to install a Thaad battery had begun on Monday, with some parts flown from the US to an air base near Seoul. A statement from the US military confirmed that the \\"first elements\\" of the system had been sent to South Korea. South Korea's Yonhap news agency, quoting a military official, said the system could be operational \\"as early as April\\". Chinese foreign spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday that China opposed the deployment and would \\"resolutely take necessary measures to defend our own security interests\\". What impact will S Korea's expanded missile defence system have? 1. The enemy launches a missile 2. The Thaad radar system detects the launch, which is relayed to command and control 3. Thaad command and control instructs the launch of an interceptor missile 4. The interceptor missile is fired at the enemy projectile 5. The enemy projectile is destroyed in the terminal phase of flight The launcher trucks can hold up to eight interceptor missiles. There is domestic opposition - many South Koreans believe the defence system will itself become a target, endangering people who live around the military sites. Opponents have staged multiple demonstrations. Internationally, both China and Russia have raised concerns, saying the system could affect the regional security balance. Last year, China's foreign minister said the system went \\"far beyond\\" the defence needs of the Korean peninsula. Russia's envoy to Seoul has called it a \\"direct threat\\" to national security. The Thaad system is well-suited to defend South Korean targets against relatively limited range North Korean missiles. But it has no ability to intercept Chinese inter-continental ballistic missiles that target the US. Why then is China so annoyed? What concerns Beijing is the system's powerful X-band radars that can \\"reach\\" far into Chinese territory. The Chinese military worries that these could be used to spot Chinese missile launches and feed the data to cue up other US defensive systems, eg interceptor missiles based in the US, potentially affecting China's deterrent capability. But the US already has powerful radars based in Japan and a Thaad system in Guam. It's not easy to quantify the additional benefit that Thaad radars in South Korea would give the Pentagon. But they will certainly give the South Koreans an important and expanded new layer of defence against missile attack. North Korea threatened last week to fire missiles in response to the start of the Foal Eagle US-South Korean military exercises. The annual drills infuriate the North, which sees them as preparation for an invasion from the South. Then early on Monday, it fired four missiles from the Tongchang-ri region, near the border with China. Three of the projectiles flew some 1,000km (620 miles) and fell into Japan's exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The exact type of missile is not yet clear but South Korean officials said they appeared to be an upgraded version of a Scud missile. The US and Japanese leaders held phone discussions after the missile launch and the United Nations Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday in an emergency meeting requested by the US and Japan to discuss the incident. Admiral Harry Harris, commander of the US South Pacific Command, said the launch confirmed \\"the prudence\\" of the decision to deploy Thaad. But the deployment will likely worsen tensions between Seoul and Beijing. In recent days South Korea has accused China of economic retaliation linked to Thaad in areas, including tourism and air travel. There has also been an outpouring of anger by Chinese consumers against the South Korean retailer Lotte, which allowed Thaad to be installed on one of its sites. Several of Lotte's stores in China have been closed down suddenly. Beijing rejects claims of economic retaliation. Is China retaliating against Lotte missile deal?","completion":"The Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) is an advanced missile defense system designed to considerably enhance South Korea's defensive capabilities against missile threats emanating from North Korea. The first elements of the Thaad system have been deployed in South Korea, aiming for full operation by April. Thaad's radar system can detect enemy missile launches and respond with an interceptor missile, destroying the enemy projectile during the terminal phase of its flight. However, the deployment of Thaad has raised concerns both within South Korea and internationally. Many South Koreans believe that the presence of the defense system could make military sites targets, putting nearby civilians in danger. Protests and demonstrations have taken place opposing the Thaad system's installation. China and Russia have also expressed concerns about the system's potential impact on regional security. Both countries argue that Thaad goes beyond the defense needs of the Korean peninsula. China objects to the X-band radars, which are capable of detecting missile launches within Chinese territory. The Chinese military is concerned that this information could be relayed to other US defense systems, affecting China's deterrent capability. The US already has powerful radars situated in Japan as well as another Thaad system in Guam. While it is difficult to quantify the advantages the Thaad system in South Korea provides to the Pentagon, it does offer South Korea a new layer of defense against missile attacks. North Korea's recent launch of four ballistic missiles has heightened tensions in the region. Furthermore, the deployment of Thaad has worsened relations between South Korea and China, with South Korea accusing China of economic retaliation in areas such as tourism and air travel. The involvement of South Korean retailer Lotte in allowing Thaad installations on its sites has also led to retaliation from Chinese consumers, with several Lotte stores being closed down in China. Overall, the introduction of the Thaad system in South Korea comes with significant benefits and drawbacks. While it provides an additional defense layer against North Korea's missile threats, it also increases tensions with China and Russia and has caused internal opposition in South Korea. The system's operation could play a critical role in shaping political and security relations in the region, and the potential consequences of its deployment should not be underestimated."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: A four-year-old girl sees three biscuits divided between a stuffed crocodile and a teddy bear.The crocodile gets two; the bear one.\\"Is that fair?\\" asks the experimenter.The girl judges that it is not.\\"How about now?\\" asks the experimenter, breaking the bear's single biscuit in half.The girl cheers up: \\"Oh yes, now it's fair.They both have two.\\" Strangely, children feel very strongly about fairness, even when they hardly understand it. Adults care about fairness too --- but how much? One way to find out is by using the ultimatum game, created by economist Werner Guth.Jack is given a pile of money and proposes how it should be divided with Jill.Jill can accept Jack's \\"ultimatum\\", otherwise the deal is off, and neither gets anything. Suppose Jack and Jill don't care about fairness, just about accumulating cash.Then Jack can offer Jill as little as he likes and Jill will still accept.After all, a little money is more than no money.But imagine, instead, that Jack and Jill both care only about fairness and that the fairest outcome is equality.Then Jack would offer Jill half the money; and Jill wouldn't accept otherwise. What happens when we ask people to play this game for real? It turns out that people value fairness a lot.Anyone offered less than 20-30% of the money is likely to reject it.Receiving an unfair offers makes us feel sick.Happily, most offers are pretty equitable; indeed, by far the most common is a 50-50 split. But children, and adults, also care about a very different sort of (un)fairness, namely cheating.Think how many games of snakes and ladders have ended in arguments when one child \\"accidentally\\" miscounts her moves and another child objects.But this sense of fairness isn't about equality of outcome: games inevitably have winners and losers.Here, fairness is about playing by the rules.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you have anemia caused by an iron deficiency, you need to get more iron in your diet. Men and non-menstruating women need about 10 mg of iron a day. Menstruating women or nursing mothers should have 15 mg of iron a day, while pregnant women need 30 mg. Eat at least 2 to 3 servings of iron-rich foods every day to help get this dosage of iron. Iron-rich foods include: Red meat, liver, poultry, pork, and fish Spinach, mustard greens, collard greens, Swiss chard, beet greens, all different kinds of lettuce, broccoli, and kale Tofu, soy milk, and other soy products Legumes, such as peas, white beans, red beans, baked bean, chickpeas, and soybeans Dried fruits, such as raisins, apricots, and prunes Prune juice Whole grain cereals and breads that have been iron-fortified Certain foods can cause your body to decrease its iron absorption. If you are trying to up your iron intake, do not drink tea, coffee, or cocoa with your meals because they lower the amount of iron you absorb. You should also not take an iron supplement with your meals. Avoid milk and dairy products for at least an hour after taking iron because the calcium in dairy products may decrease iron absorption. If you are suffering from a vitamin B12 deficiency that is causing your anemia, you need to get more of this nutrient from your diet. You should be getting 2.5 mcg of B12 every day. If you are pregnant, you should get 2.6 mcg per day. If you are nursing, you should be getting 2.8 mcg every day. Eat at least 2 to 3 servings of vitamin B12-rich foods every day to get these daily amounts. Foods rich in vitamin B12 include: Breakfast cereals fortified with vitamin B12 Beef, liver, poultry, sardines, salmon, tuna, and cod Eggs, milk, yogurt, and cheese Foods with added vitamin B12, such as soy-based beverages and vegetarian burgers Deficiencies of folate, another form of vitamin B, can also cause anemia. Men over 13 years old should have 400 mcg of folate per day. Women over 13, pregnant women, and women who are breastfeeding should have 400 to 600 mcg per day. To help with this, you should eat 2 to 3 servings of folate-rich foods every day. These foods include: Bread, pasta, and rice with added folic acid, which is a form of folate Kale, broccoli, lettuces, spinach, Swiss chard, beet greens, and collard greens Dried beans, such as lentils, black-eyed peas, pinto, garbanzo, and kidney Beef liver Eggs Bananas, oranges, orange juice, and other fruits and fruit juices To make healthy RBCs to keep up your blood supply, your body needs vitamin C. Adults over 19 should get 85 mg of vitamin C per day. Smokers should get an extra 35 mg daily. Vitamin C also enhances iron absorption, so vitamin C-containing foods can be taken with the iron-containing foods to increase your overall absorption. Vitamin C-rich foods include: Citrus fruits, such as oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, lemons, and limes Kiwi fruit, papaya, and pineapple Berries, such as strawberries and raspberries Cantaloupe Vegetables, including broccoli, tomatoes, red peppers, potatoes, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and leafy green vegetables. You should keep track of how much iron, B12, folate, and Vitamin C you get each day. You can do this by keeping track of the serving sizes of the foods you eat and checking online to see how much of each nutrient is in the serving size you eat. You can also determine how much of each nutrient is in the food you eat by using an online Food Advisor, which is a questionnaire that can help determine your overall vitamin and mineral intake. If you find that you can't get enough nutrients from food sources, you can take a supplement to pick up the slack. Try to buy vitamins and minerals derived from organic, whole foods, instead of those that have been chemically synthesized. You can buy supplements for each separate vitamin and mineral, or you can buy a multivitamin that has them all in it. Make sure any supplement you buy has been tested by an independent lab. It also needs a Seal of Approval from a reputable investigation agency, such as Consumer Labs, the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), LabDoor, or the Natural Products Association (NPA). Always follow your doctor’s instructions and recommendations in regards to supplements. Although these nutrients exist in nature, you can get too much of them. If you are getting too much of them from food and supplements, it can have some adverse effects on your health. For example, there is a condition called hemochromatosis that can be acquired if you are taking too much iron as a supplement. It can be very serious. Once you have been using nutrition for a while, you should get retested to see if your anemia has improved. The general timeline for getting tested again is 6 to 8 weeks. Your doctor may recommend you get retested sooner, so do as they recommend.","completion":"Anemia can be improved by increasing iron, vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin C in your diet through iron-rich foods, vitamin B12-rich foods, folate-rich foods, and vitamin C-rich foods, while avoiding certain foods that decrease iron absorption; if needed, consider taking supplements for these nutrients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The other involves the political and military leaders trying to contain the epidemic. Set in the small town of Evans City, Pennsylvania, the central characters are firefighter David, his girlfriend, nurse Judy, and firefighter Clank. David was a Green Beret and Clank an infantryman, both having served in Vietnam. The town has seen a number of violent events, including arson at a local farm by a demented farmer. Judy and David are very concerned, since Judy is pregnant. Meanwhile, heavily armed U.S. troops in NBC suits and gas masks arrive in town, led by Major Ryder, who takes over the doctor's office where Judy works. Days earlier, an Army plane carrying an untested bioweapon crash-landed in the hills near the town, infecting the water supply with a virus code-named \\"Trixie,\\" causing victims to either die or become homicidally insane. \\"Trixie\\" is highly contagious, with anyone drinking from the Evans City reservoir becoming affected.

Pyle, who represents America and its policies in Vietnam, is a CIA operative sent to steer the war according to Americas interests, and is passionately devoted to the ideas of York Harding, an American foreign policy theorist who said that what Vietnam needed was a third player to take the place of both the colonialists and the Vietnamese rebels and restore order. This third player was plainly meant to be America, and so Pyle sets about creating a Third Force against the Viet Minh by using a Vietnamese splinter group headed by corrupt militia leader General Thé (based on the actual Trinh Minh The). His arming of Thé's militia with American weaponry leads to a series of terrorist bombings in Saigon. These bombings, dishonestly blamed on the Communists in order to further American outrage, kill a number of innocent people, including women and children.Meanwhile, Pyle has stolen Fowlers Vietnamese mistress Phuong, promising her marriage and security. When Fowler finds out about Pyle's involvement in the bombings, he takes one definitive action to seal all of their fates. He indirectly agrees to let his assistant, Hinh, and his Communist cohorts confront Pyle; when Pyle tries to flee, Hinh fatally stabs him.

He felt that Doctor Who could have \\"collisions of characters that no other show in the world can do\\", and that it was about finding a \\"disparate\\" group of characters who would \\"bounce\\" off each other. Nefertiti's decision not to return to her own time fits in with the historical record, as the date and cause of her death are unknown. Chibnall asked to introduce Rory's father, as Amy and Rory would be leaving in four episodes and Rory's family life had not been explored yet. Mark Williams who played Rory's father previously appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio adventure The Eternal Summer. Rupert Graves, who played an Edwardian hunter in this episode, previously worked with Moffat on the BBC series Sherlock. David Bradley's character, Solomon, was modelled on a \\"well-known nightclub owner with long hair\\". Chibnall described him as \\"half businessman, half Somali pirate\\". Bradley and Williams had previously worked together on the Harry Potter film franchise. Bradley was later cast as the First Doctor William Hartnell for the 50th anniversary documentary drama An Adventure in Space and Time.

We are big supporters of buying locally and we are here to tell you why it is so important for your family, the community and the environment. The concept of buying locally is simple: buy food produced, grown, or raised as close to your home as possible. Not only will your food be fresher and tastier, but you are helping protect the environment and are supporting businesses within your community and reducing pollution. Better for the environment Sustainability and global warming are such hot topics at the moment, and many people want to do their bit to help support a healthier environment. Small action carried out by many people can make a big difference. Most materials in an average North American meal have traveled about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate. To cut out a big part of this travel would greatly reduce not only pollution from transportation and refrigeration but also customers' expenses as well.

Warlock is a small Utah mining town of the early 1880s. Cowboys working for Abe McQuown often come into town to shoot the place up, kill on just a whim, beating or humiliating any sheriff who tries to stand up to them. The Citizens' Committee decides to hire Clay Blaisedell, a renowned gunfighter, as town marshal in spite of the misgivings of some, such as old Judge Holloway who insists that the situation should be handled within the law (though a loophole prevents it from being done effectively). Blaisedell, famous for his golden-handled revolvers, arrives in Warlock with his devoted friend, Tom Morgan, his club-footed, right-hand man, who is no slouch with a gun himself. Morgan has a reputation as a heavy-drinking gambler, but Blaisedell insists that Morgan is part of the package. They even take over the local saloon and rename it the \\"French Palace\\" (something they appear to have done in previous towns, since they bring the signboard with them). Their first encounter with McQuown's men is without bloodshed. The cowboys are intimidated by Blaisedell and one, Johnny Gannon, stays behind. Gannon has been put off by their propensity for killing, particularly the shooting of victims in the back, for some time now and resolves to be more law-abiding. Morgan learns that his old flame, Lily Dollar, is coming to town on the stagecoach, and she is accompanied by Bob Nicholson, brother of Big Ben Nicholson, who was recently killed by Blaisedell. Lily had left Morgan for Big Ben and knows that Morgan pushed Ben into challenging Blaisedell, who killed him as a result. She wants Blaisedell dead to punish Morgan. Morgan sets out to meet the stagecoach but it is robbed by some of McQuown's cowboys as he watches from a distance. He takes advantage of the situation to kill Bob Nicholson unseen.

Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, while Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which tribe experienced more ozone depletion? Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the Ana tribe that lives near the South Pole in Antarctica experienced more ozone depletion than the Momu tribe living in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. The paragraph clearly indicates that the loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion is caused by pollutants such as chlorine and bromine gases which are released from aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. As a result of ozone depletion, higher levels of UV radiation reach the Earth, leading to various negative effects on humans and the environment such as increased risks of skin cancers and eye cataracts, disturbance in the nitrogen cycle, killing of plankton, and a disruption in ocean food webs. Although the rate of ozone loss has slowed due to restrictions on pollutants, the ozone layer is still at risk. Since the ozone hole is specifically mentioned to be over Antarctica, it is evident that the Ana tribe living in that region would be affected more by ozone depletion when compared to the Momu tribe living near the North Pole in Alaska. The geographical location of the two tribes substantially influences the difference in the impact of ozone depletion on their respective environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Giant Octopus Movie plot: Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil (Deborah Gibson) is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie (Mark Hengst) believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a sharkâs tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water. A review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders (Sean Lawlor), who believes it belonged to a Megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada (Vic Chao), a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeilâs submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus. MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to man-made global warming, and wonders if the creatures are mankindâs âcomeuppanceâ. Meanwhile, a U.S. \\"naval destroyer\\"...

The premise states that medical science has prolonged life but not necessarily the quality of life, implying that there are limitations to the advancements made in medical science. To address the hypothesis accurately, we need to examine the ongoing research, allocations of funds, and investor perspectives in the field of medical science and health technology aimed at improving the quality of life in later years. There is evidence suggesting that significant amounts of funding and investment are being directed towards improving the quality of life for aging individuals. Governments, research institutions, and private investors have increasingly recognized the need to direct resources towards research and development in healthcare and medical technologies. The objective of such investment is to enhance the quality of life for individuals as they age, thereby curbing the undesirable implications of diseases and ailments associated with aging. Some examples of areas that attract substantial investment include: 1. Geriatric care and research: Geriatrics is a medical specialty focused on the health and well-being of older adults. With an aging global population, there is increasing recognition of the need for investment in geriatric care, ranging from pharmaceutical development for age-related diseases to research in the prevention and management of common ailments in the elderly. 2. Regenerative medicine: This field explores the potential of regenerating damaged or degenerating tissues and organs, which could lead to significant improvements in the quality of life for individuals suffering from chronic illnesses, disabilities, or age-related conditions. 3. Biotechnology and genetic research: The investigation of genetic factors contributing to the aging process, as well as the development of targeted therapies, can lead to personalized and effective treatments for age-related diseases, thereby improving the quality of later life. 4. Assistive technologies: The development and commercialization of devices and technologies that can assist older adults in performing daily tasks can have a substantial impact on maintaining their independence and quality of life. 5. Funding for aging research institutions: Many governments and private institutions have increased their support for aging research centers and agencies. These investments aim to develop a better understanding of the aging process and translate that knowledge into improved healthcare and quality of life for the elderly. While it is true that advancements in medical science have achieved life extension without necessarily prolonging the quality of life, the hypothesis that a considerable amount of money is being directed towards enhancing the quality of life in later years cannot be dismissed. With the continuous growth of the global aging population and the increasing demand for effective solutions to manage age-related diseases and conditions, it can be posited that substantial funding is being allocated to bridge the gap between life extension and the preservation of a high quality of life for older adults."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write an article based on this summary: The UK voluntary living wage, promoted by the Living Wage Foundation campaign group, is to rise by 20p an hour. Article:","completion":"Title: UK Voluntary Living Wage Increases by 20p per Hour Introduction: The United Kingdom's voluntary living wage has seen a recent increase, with a rise of 20 pence per hour. This change has been promoted by the Living Wage Foundation, a campaign group that encourages businesses to pay a fair wage to their workers. 1. What is the UK Voluntary Living Wage? The UK voluntary living wage is an hourly rate that is independently calculated and takes into account the actual cost of living in the UK. This rate is set according to the needs of the workers and their families. It is different from the government's national living wage, which is the legal minimum hourly rate that all employers must pay their workers aged 23 and above. The voluntary living wage, as the name suggests, is not legally binding and comes as a result of the employers' own will to ensure their workers receive a reasonable payment for their work. 2. The Role of the Living Wage Foundation The Living Wage Foundation is a campaign group advocating for a higher wage rate for workers throughout the United Kingdom. The foundation works with businesses of all sizes and sectors to encourage them to implement a voluntary living wage that reflects the cost of living and provides employees with a more comfortable financial situation. By endorsing a socially responsible approach, the foundation aims to raise awareness of the issue and bring about positive change within the business community. 3. The Impact of the Wage Increase The recent 20 pence per hour increase in the voluntary living wage will not only benefit the workers who receive it but also contribute to the overall well-being of the UK economy. Research has shown that when employees are paid a fair wage, they are more likely to feel motivated and engaged in their work, leading to improved performance, loyalty, and retention. The wage increase allows businesses to invest in their staff, which in turn can lead to better customer service, higher productivity levels, and a more loyal workforce. 4. The Benefits for Workers and Employers Alike The benefits of the UK voluntary living wage extend beyond just the employees who are directly affected. Businesses that choose to adopt the voluntary living wage often experience a variety of positive outcomes, including increased staff morale, reduced absenteeism, and a higher retention of skilled workers, thus promoting a more positive and motivated work environment. Moreover, by committing to fair wage practices, employers can create a reputation of being responsible corporate citizens, attracting potential employees and customers who value social responsibility. Conclusion: The recent 20 pence per hour increase in the UK voluntary living wage, as promoted by the Living Wage Foundation, highlights the importance of paying workers fairly and adequately. By adopting these fair wage practices, businesses can create a positive impact on both their employees' livelihoods and the overall economy. It is a sign of progress and an endorsement of responsible corporate citizenship, emphasizing the need for the continuous support of initiatives aimed at improving the working conditions of people in the United Kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This premise only provides information about the historical event of the restoration and the current state of the building. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that \\"Greyfriars Church is in total ruins and can't be fixed.\\" This statement contradicts the information provided in the premise. The hypothesis claims that the Church is now in poor condition, but the premise has established that it underwent restoration in 1938, resulting in the structure we currently see. As a result, the hypothesis does not logically follow the premise because their statements conflict, meaning that accepting the premise as true does not guarantee that the hypothesis is also accurate.

Question: Process: - Gather the ingredients for the cake - Mix the flour, sugar, egg, and water to make batter - Pour the mixture into a cake pan - Place the cake in the oven to cook - Take the cake out when it is cooked through - Let the cake cool - Serve the cake - Question: suppose less caterpillar starts to form a cocoon happens, how will it affect a BIGGER cake. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"The question seems to be asking about the effect of a lesser number of caterpillars forming cocoons on a bigger cake, and how this would influence the second effect mentioned, which is the mixing of ingredients to make the batter. First, it's important to clarify that caterpillars and the process of making a cake are not directly related. Caterpillars forming cocoons is a natural process that occurs in their life cycles, while making a cake is a human activity in the realm of baking and culinary arts. However, if we try to find a connection or analogy between these two concepts, we can say that a decrease in the number of caterpillars forming cocoons could potentially affect the availability of certain ingredients used in making a cake. For example, some caterpillars eat plant parts, and if there are fewer caterpillars, it might lead to a higher availability of plants or plant-based ingredients. This, however, would have a negligible effect on the cake-making process itself, as the core cake ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, and water are not directly sourced from caterpillars or affected by the cocoon-forming process. Coming to the second part of the question regarding the supposed perturbation influencing the second effect, which is the mixing of the ingredients. Since the decrease in caterpillars forming cocoons has no direct impact on the availability or quality of the key ingredients for a cake, there would be no effect on the mixing process. The ingredients would still be combined as usual to create the batter, and the overall process of making the cake would remain unchanged. In conclusion, the lesser number of caterpillars forming cocoons would have no effect on the making of a bigger cake nor on the mixing of the ingredients to create the batter. The two processes are unrelated, and the supposed perturbation does not influence the cake-making steps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If it appears to be hanging, try to look behind it and see a wall. If the mirror seems to be part of the wall itself, there's a good chance it's a two-way mirror, which must be set into the wall rather than hung onto it. That way, people standing on the other side of the wall can observe someone looking in the mirror. A two-way mirror is a piece of glass coated with a substance called micro pane. If you stand on the treated side, you see your reflection but the untreated side looks like a tinted window. If you see a wall behind the mirror, it's a good bet that it's nothing more than a regular mirror. Look around and determine whether the lighting seems extraordinarily bright. If so, you might be looking at a two-way mirror. However, if the light in the room is relatively dim, and you can't immediately see through the mirror, it's probably just a standard mirror. For a two-way mirror to be effective, the light on the mirrored side needs to be 10 times brighter than the light on the other side. If the lighting is any dimmer, it's possible to see through the glass to the observation area. If you're in a public place and in an area where you'd expect privacy, such as a restroom, it's unlikely and illegal to have a two-way mirror. On the other hand, two-way mirrors are frequently used by law enforcement. For example, two-way mirrors are used in interrogation rooms and for lineups. The use of two-way mirrors is closely tied to issues of personal privacy and Constitutional rights. Most states have passed additional legislation preventing the use of two-way mirrors in rest rooms, locker rooms, showers, fitting rooms and hotel rooms. If a location has chosen to use two-way mirrors for surveillance, they are required to post signs that notify you. Many places, such as gas stations, will use one way metal mirrors because glass mirrors can be destroyed by users. If the mirror in question is metal, then it is not a two-way mirror. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article discusses how to identify two-way mirrors and highlights some key characteristics to distinguish them from standard mirrors. A two-way mirror is a piece of glass coated with micro pane, allowing for one side to be reflective while the other side appears as a tinted window.

I struggled to sound commanding,\\" let's break it down step by step: Step 1: Identify the context. The context here is someone speaking, specifically asking someone to listen, which indicates that they want to convey something important. Step 2: Understand the intention. The intention of the speaker is to sound commanding or authoritative, which means they want to have control over the situation or assert their influence on the listener. Step 3: Determine the outcome. The speaker struggles to sound commanding or authoritative, which implies they are not entirely successful in achieving their desired tone. Step 4: Make an inference. Since we know the speaker's intention was to sound commanding but struggled to do so, we can infer that they tried to assert control or authority in the conversation. Step 5: Conclude. Based on the steps above, we can reasonably conclude that \\"I tried to sound in charge\\" is an accurate summary of \\"Listen. I struggled to sound commanding.\\" The statement captures the intention of wanting to demonstrate authority while also acknowledging the struggle to achieve that goal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: Dylan began 1973 by signing with a new label, David Geffen's Asylum Records (and Island in the UK), when his contract with Columbia Records expired. On his next album, Planet Waves, he used the Band as backing group, while rehearsing for a tour. The album included two versions of \\"Forever Young\\", which became one of his most popular songs. As one critic described it, the song projected \\"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\\", and Dylan himself commented: \\"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\\"Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label. In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts. A live double album, Before the Flood, was on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \\"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\\". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves. Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums. After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \\"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\\" In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \\"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\\" Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements.

Question: suppose there are less dirty dishes happens, how will it affect The cut in the skin is larger. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"Although the question seems a bit disjointed, I believe it's asking about the relationship between the number of dirty dishes and the impact on the cut or wound (whether the cut is larger or smaller). Let's explore each option in detail: A: More The relationship between the number of dirty dishes and the size of the skin wound may not be directly connected. More dirty dishes might indicate a potentially unclean environment where bacteria might be more likely to thrive. However, this does not necessarily mean that the size of the cut or wound would be larger. The size of the cut would depend on the mechanism by which the skin is cut or damaged and the severity of the injury. B: Less Similarly, having fewer dirty dishes might result in a cleaner environment overall and lessen the chance that bacteria may enter the wound. However, just as with the \\"more\\" scenario, this does not necessarily translate to the cut being any smaller. The size of the cut would still depend on the circumstances and severity of the injury. C: No effect The number of dirty dishes by itself likely doesn't have any significant effect on the size of the skin wound. The size of the wound is dependent on factors such as the severity of the injury and how it occurred. Although more dirty dishes might contribute to a potentially unclean environment where bacteria may thrive, this does not mean that the size of the cut or wound would directly and explicitly be affected by the number of dirty dishes. Based on the analysis above, the most logical answer is option C: no effect. The number of dirty dishes does not directly impact the size of the skin wound.

Input: Context: Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that may repair vascular injury are reduced in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We reasoned that EPC number and function may be increased by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) used to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells in healthy donors.', 'Sixteen CAD patients had reduced CD34(+)/CD133(+) (0.0224+/-0.0063% versus 0.121+/-0.038% mononuclear cells [MNCs], P<0.01) and CD133(+)/VEGFR-2(+) cells, consistent with EPC phenotype (0.00033+/-0.00015% versus 0.0017+/-0.0006% MNCs, P<0.01), compared with 7 healthy controls. Patients also had fewer clusters of cells in culture, with out-growth consistent with mature endothelial phenotype (2+/-1/well) compared with 16 healthy subjects at high risk (13+/-4/well, P<0.05) or 14 at low risk (22+/-3/well, P<0.001) for CAD. G-CSF 10 microg/kg per day for 5 days increased CD34(+)/CD133(+) cells from 0.5+/-0.2/microL to 59.5+/-10.6/microL and CD133(+)/ VEGFR-2(+) cells from 0.007+/-0.004/microL to 1.9+/-0.6/microL (both P<0.001). Also increased were CD133(+) cells that coexpressed the homing receptor CXCR4 (30.4+/-8.3/microL, P<0.05). Endothelial cell-forming clusters in 10 patients increased to 27+/-9/well after treatment (P<0.05), with a decline to 9+/-4/well at 2 weeks (P=0.06). Answer: Despite reduced EPCs compared with healthy controls, patients with CAD respond to G-CSF with increases in EPC number and homing receptor expression in the circulation and endothelial out-growth in culture. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are reduced in coronary artery disease. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) administered to patients increased: (1) CD133+/VEGFR-2+ cells consistent with EPC phenotype; (2) CD133+ cells coexpressing the chemokine receptor CXCR4, important for homing of EPCs to ischemic tissue; and (3) endothelial cell-forming clusters in culture. Whether EPCs mobilized into the circulation will be useful for the purpose of initiating vascular growth and myocyte repair in coronary artery disease patients must be tested in clinical trials.

Article: Watching bison up close is fascinating, like watching a grass fire about to leap out of control. With their huge, wedge-shaped heads and silver-dollar-size brown eyes, the 2,000-pound animals are symbols of another place and time. More than 100 bison now roam the 30,000-acre American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana -- the first time they've inhabited that region in a century. Direct descendants of the tens of millions of bison that once populated the Western plains, they represent an epic effort: to restore a piece of America's prairie to the national grandeur that Lewis and Clark extolled two centuries ago. During that famous expedition across the Western states to the Pacific, the two explorers encountered so many bison that they had to wait hours for one herd to pass. In order to protect what's here and reintroduce long-gone wildlife (something the World Wildlife Fund is helping with), the American Prairie Foundation began purchasing land from local ranchers in 2004. It now owns 30,000 acres and has grazing privileges on another 57,000. Its goal over the next 25 years is to assemble three million acres, the largest area of land devoted to wildlife management in the continental United States. Already, herds of elk, deer, and pronghorn antelope roam the grasslands, where visitors can camp, hike, and bike. Cottonwoods and willows are thriving along streams, creating habitats for bobcats, beavers, and other animals. Not everyone shares APF's vision. Some residents of Phillips County (pop. 3,904) worry that the area could become a prairie Disneyland, overcrowded with tourists. But the biggest obstacle is the ranchers themselves, whose cattle compete with prairie dogs and bison for grass and space. \\"People like me have no intention of selling their ranches,\\" says Dale Veseth, who heads the Ranchers Stewardship Alliance of 35 families in Phillips County and whose family has been ranching here since 1886. \\"They've been a labor of love through the generations.\\" Instead, he wants APF to pay or ranchers to raise... Question: What measures have been taken to protect the wildlife by APF? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They have bought large land from farmers for bison to live on.\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the American Prairie Foundation (APF) has indeed taken significant measures to protect and reintroduce wildlife in the region, and one of the main actions has been purchasing land from local ranchers since 2004. They have successfully bought 30,000 acres and secured grazing privileges on another 57,000 acres. Ultimately, APF aims to assemble three million acres over the next 25 years, making it the largest land area devoted to wildlife management in the continental United States. This initiative of acquiring land from farmers and ranchers serves the purpose of providing a natural habitat for bison and other wildlife species to thrive. By creating a protected environment, the American Prairie Reserve can reintroduce bison and various other species, including elk, deer, pronghorn antelope, bobcats, and beavers, alongside ensuring the preservation of native plants like cottonwoods and willows. However, it is essential to note that this endeavor has been met with some resistance from local ranchers, who have a deep-rooted history in the area and are concerned about their livelihood. People like Dale Veseth, who leads the Ranchers Stewardship Alliance, prefer the APF to pay ranchers to raise their cattle alongside APF's conservation efforts rather than purchase their land. Overall, the American Prairie Foundation has made substantial efforts to protect and conserve wildlife by acquiring land from farmers and ranchers for bison and other species to live on. While some opposition exists from local stakeholders, the foundation's mission to restore America's prairie to its once-national grandeur is making notable progress."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: Australian half-back Chris Sandow's exit from Warrington was not a shock, says Wolves head coach Tony Smith. Article:","completion":"Title: Warrington Wolves Head Coach Tony Smith Unsurprised by Chris Sandow's Departure Introduction: The departure of Australian half-back Chris Sandow from Warrington Wolves was not surprising, according to the team's head coach, Tony Smith. Background on Chris Sandow: Chris Sandow, the Australian playmaker, has built a reputation as a talented half-back during his career. He began his professional journey with South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League (NRL) before moving to the Parramatta Eels. In 2015, Sandow made his way to the Super League, signing with the Warrington Wolves. His skillful displays on the field have earned him several admirers, but his time with the Wolves has now come to an end. Tony Smith's Perspective: Tony Smith, the head coach of the Warrington Wolves, has stated that Sandow's exit from the club was not unexpected. Smith, who has overseen the team's development and performance since 2009, has extensive experience in the rugby league, both as a player and a coach. Throughout his time at the helm, Smith has managed numerous player departures and arrivals, helping guide the team through periods of transition. Possible Reasons for Sandow's Departure: While neither Sandow nor the Warrington Wolves have revealed specific reasons for the player's departure from the club, there could be several factors at play. It is possible that Sandow has received attractive offers from other clubs, either in the Super League or back home in the NRL. Alternatively, personal reasons or the desire for a new challenge could have influenced his decision to move on. Impact on Warrington Wolves: Chris Sandow's exit from the team will certainly leave a void in the Wolves' half-back position. His experience and skill on the field have been crucial in the team's success in recent years. Nonetheless, the Warrington Wolves have faced similar situations in the past and have proven adept at finding suitable replacements. The team will likely be looking for players who can fill the gap left by Sandow and contribute to the team's continued success in the Super League. Conclusion: In the ever-changing world of professional sports, the departure of a key player like Chris Sandow is not uncommon. Warrington Wolves head coach Tony Smith has acknowledged this reality, expressing a lack of surprise at Sandow's exit from the team. As the Wolves move forward without their accomplished half-back, they will surely adopt a proactive approach in seeking a suitable replacement to help maintain their competitiveness in the league."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? genuinely","completion":"The phrase \\"genuinely\\" is a neutral term that could be interpreted in a positive or negative context depending on the situation in which it is used and the accompanying words or phrases. However, it frequently has a positive connotation, as it is used to express authenticity, sincerity, and honesty. The adjective \\"genuine\\" means authentic, not fake or counterfeit, and can be used to describe an object or a person's behavior, emotions, or character. When used as an adverb, \\"genuinely\\" describes the manner in which something is done or the degree to which someone expresses a genuine emotion or intention. In a positive context, \\"genuinely\\" is often associated with honesty, sincerity, and true feelings. For example: 1. He genuinely cares about the wellbeing of his employees. 2. I am genuinely happy for your success. 3. She is genuinely remorseful for her actions. In these cases, \\"genuinely\\" adds weight to the statement by reinforcing the authenticity and credibility of the emotions involved, emphasizing that they are heartfelt and sincere. On the other hand, \\"genuinely\\" could also be used in a negative context, when referring to someone's negative emotions, actions, or beliefs. For example: 1. He is genuinely struggling with his mental health. 2. They were genuinely upset about the outcome of the game. 3. She was genuinely appalled by his behavior. In these cases, \\"genuinely\\" conveys that these emotions, actions, or beliefs are authentic and real. While the overall sentiment of these statements may be deemed negative, the use of \\"genuinely\\" as a descriptor remains neutral. In conclusion, the phrase \\"genuinely\\" is not inherently positive or negative, but can take on a positive or negative connotation based on the context in which it is used and the accompanying words or phrases. It is essential to note the surrounding information to determine the intended tone or implication of the phrase.

Write some highlights for the following article: Detroit Mayor David Bing called Tuesday's 85 fires in the city a \\"natural disaster\\" and defended the fire department's response. \\"I have ultimate confidence in the Detroit Fire Department,\\" he said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference. \\"I think they've done an outstanding job.\\" Asked whether the department was adequately staffed or had enough equipment Tuesday, Bing said the important thing was that no one was hurt or killed. \\"I don't care how much money you have. When something like this happens, all you can do is respond,\\" he said. Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. said the department is budgeted for about 500 firefighters, about 20 fewer positions than last year. About 236 firefighters fought Tuesday's fires across much of the city and took no breaks, Mack added. The inferno was a perfect storm, and was aggravated by high winds and downed power lines, the officials said. \\"It just created a firestorm where we had fires,\\" the fire commissioner said, adding that at least eight of the fires were linked to downed power lines and two to arson, though he said those numbers may change. He said response times might have been slow because of the volume of calls and officials having to prioritize the fires, especially if some were at vacant residences. Monday morning quarterbacking of resources is always easy to do, Mack said. \\"I have to balance safety of public and the monies the department has.\\" CNN iReporter Joe Wilk, who recorded video of flames and their charred aftermath Tuesday and Wednesday, said that one fire spread to about 10 homes in an hour. \\"It's pretty tragic. How many people just lost their houses and everything they own?\\" he asked. A woman told him that firefighters didn't arrive for an hour to fight the fire, which also destroyed garages. \\"A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires,\\" said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. \\"We had winds from 30 to 50 mph and have a number of downed power wires,\\" Mack said. \\"We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires, which makes more fires with the wind being so strong.\\" Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., the fire department responded to 140 calls of wires down before the evening outbreak. Fire officials said Wednesday that there were still hot spots and downed power lines in the city. Fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods helped Detroit firefighters. Mack said perhaps he should have asked for help earlier. \\"It's a matter of public safety,\\" Dumas said. \\"We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires.\\" City officials say they will be communicating with DTE Energy about its response to downed power lines. Bing said he was heartened by the community response. \\"I want to thank the residents who came and did what they needed to do,\\" the mayor said. \\"That's one of the cultural changes we are starting to see here in the city.

FBWrapper fulfills its aim to provide a fluid and enjoyable alternative to Facebook's standard app and mobile website with a good deal of style and seamless integration. I would like to emphasize that this is an overall positive review and I would recommend that you give it a try, especially if you're fed up with some of the inconveniences associated with the official Facebook app. The first thing I noticed upon installing the app was its appealing and user-friendly interface. The clearly presented options, smooth swiping motions, and minimalist design of FBWrapper is a breath of fresh air as compared to the clutter and confusion some users may have experienced with other Facebook interfaces. It provides easy access to essential Facebook features such as the newsfeed, messenger, profile, friend requests, and notifications, all within one app, eliminating the need to install separate Facebook or Messenger apps, thus conserving precious storage space on my phone. The app's speed and performance are remarkably impressive. FBWrapper is light on the system, using less storage space and consuming noticeably lower battery resources in comparison to the official Facebook app. Its quick load-time and responsiveness are certainly valuable attributes that allow me to stay connected without compromising my phone's overall operational efficiency. Another feature FBWrapper also offers is respect for user privacy. It offers options to block Facebook's tracking capabilities and prevents the collection of personal information which is an important factor for many users concerned with their online privacy. Additionally, the app allows users to customize the appearance with multiple themes, providing a personalized Facebook browsing experience which is appreciated. However, a few issues prevent me from giving the app a perfect score. In certain instances, I have encountered occasional glitches with the in-app messaging feature which can be mildly irritating. Furthermore, the lack of support for voice and video calls using FBWrapper is a limitation that might cause people to rely on the Facebook Messenger app for these functions. Another niggle I have is that some notification alerts can be slightly delayed, causing me to miss out on information as it happens on Facebook's standard app or browser version. In conclusion, I believe com.danvelazco.fbwrapper is a worthy alternative to Facebook's official app. It features an appealing interface, efficient resource usage, and measures to maintain user privacy.

No Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"if a species is rare, harm to it's population increases or decreases?\\" is \\"pesticides\\", given that the rarity of a species increases harm to population exponentially? A:","completion":"Based on the question statement and your given options of Yes and No, it is apparent that \\"pesticides\\" is not a suitable answer to the question: \\"if a species is rare, does harm to its population increase or decrease?\\" However, I can provide you with an explanation that relates rarity, population harm, and pesticides. In general, when a species is rare, harm to its population can be more significant than it would be for a more abundant species. This is because a smaller population size makes the species more vulnerable to various threats such as habitat loss, disease, predation, and, indeed, pesticides. The rarity of a species may increase the harm to the population exponentially due to various factors such as: 1. Reduced genetic diversity: A smaller population is likely to suffer from reduced genetic diversity, which can exacerbate susceptibility to diseases and other threats, making recovery more difficult. 2. Inbreeding: Rare species with small populations are more likely to experience inbreeding, which can result in a higher likelihood of harmful genetic traits being passed on to future generations. 3. Greater vulnerability to environmental disturbances: A smaller population may be less resilient to sudden changes in their environment, including exposure to pesticides or other toxic substances. 4. Allee effect: The Allee effect is a phenomenon in which the fitness and reproductive success of a species decrease as the population size decreases. This can increase the risk of extinction for rare species. Given these factors, it would be more appropriate to answer the question with \\"Yes\\" or \\"increases,\\" indicating that harm to a rare species' population does indeed increase as a result of their scarcity. However, it's important to remember that every species is unique and other factors, such as the specific threats they face, their reproductive rates, and their ability to adapt, will also play critical roles in determining the level of harm experienced by any given rare species."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Belinda Jo Carlisle was born in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California on August 17, 1958 to Harold Carlisle, a gas station employee, and his wife, Joanne (nee Thompson), a homemaker. Her mother met her father, who was twenty years her senior, at age eighteen, and Carlisle was born nine months later. She was named after her mother's favorite film, Johnny Belinda (1948). Carlisle was the first of seven siblings, with three brothers and three sisters. In 2001, The Go-Go's reunited again and released an album of new material, God Bless The Go-Go's. Green Day's lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong co-wrote the only released single \\"Unforgiven\\". God Bless The Go-Go's received mixed reviews from critics. Peter Fawthrop of AllMusic wrote \\"Every bit as Go-Go's, that is, as their non-hits and less remarkable material. While The Go-Go's sound is intact, there is not a \\"We Got the Beat\\" or a \\"Head Over Heels\\" to be found. It is feasible that in this age of pop rebirth, The Go-Go's decided it was now or never ... The album doesn't attempt to update the band's sound with hip-hop moves or electronic frippery, for which God should bless 'em, indeed. The girls' hold on the current pop world remains so strong that Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong co-writes a song (\\"Unforgiven\\") in impeccable Go-Go's drag\\". In spite of the mixed reviews, the album charted in the US Billboard 200, peaking at number No. 57. Around the time of The Go-Go's definitive reunion tour, Carlisle appeared nude for the cover feature and a full pictorial of the August 2001 edition of Playboy. In 2007, Carlisle released her seventh album, Voila, which was her first full-length solo studio album in more than ten years. The album was produced by John Reynolds and included Brian Eno on keyboards. Consisting of a mix of French pop tunes and chanson standards, including covers of Francoise Hardy and Edith Piaf classics, Voila was released via Rykodisc in the UK on February 5 and in the United States the following day, February 6, 2007. In early 2009, Carlisle was on the eighth season of Dancing with the Stars, paired with Jonathan Roberts. She was the first star to be eliminated from the competition, on March 17. In October 2009, Carlisle took over the role of Velma Von Tussle in London's West End production of Hairspray at the Shaftesbury Theatre. She remained with the show till late January 2010 and was replaced by Siobhan McCarthy. What singles did they release?","completion":"From the article, it is mentioned that The Go-Go's released a single titled \\"Unforgiven\\" from their album God Bless The Go-Go's in 2001.

Options: - bowling alley - city - military base - fashion show - football game The answer is \\"bowling alley\\" because A:","completion":"A gutter in a bowling alley is a narrow channel on both sides of the bowling lane, which is designed to catch a ball that rolls off the main lane surface. If a bowler accidentally throws the ball too far to the left or right, it can land in this gutter and become unable to hit the pins. By having gutters, a bowling alley prevents a ball from rolling out of control or taking an unintended path, ensuring that the game is played fairly and safely. In contrast to the other options mentioned: - A city mostly refers to an urban area where people live and work. The concept of gutters here usually pertains to the drainage system, which helps in managing water flow to prevent flooding and keep the streets clean. It has nothing to do with preventing a ball from becoming runway. - A military base is a place where military personnel are stationed, trained, and live. It focuses on the defense and security of a nation. Gutters or similar channels are not associated with preventing runaway balls in this context. - A fashion show is an event where designers and models showcase their apparel and accessories, usually on a runway. The main purpose is to display new fashion trends. There is no connection between gutters and preventing a ball from becoming runway in a fashion show. - A football game is a sporting event that takes place on a rectangular field, typically with goalposts at each end. The main objective is to score goals by kicking the ball into the opposing team's goal. Although some football fields may have drainage systems, they are not designed specifically to prevent a ball from becoming runway. Therefore, the answer is \\"bowling alley,\\" as it presents the most relevant and accurate context for gutters preventing a ball from becoming runway."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: Answer:","completion":"The term for any way that an animal interacts with other animals or the environment is known as \\"behavior.\\" Animal behavior encompasses a wide range of activities and interactions that occur between animals and their surroundings, helping them navigate various aspects of their lives, including feeding, mating, communication, social interactions, and survival. Animal behavior is a fascinating field of study that integrates various branches of science, such as biology, psychology, ethology (the scientific study of animal behavior), and ecology. Through closely observing and analyzing animal behavior, scientists strive to understand the intricate ways in which animals adapt to their environment and interact with other living things. There are several types of animal behaviors that researchers commonly study: 1. Innate behavior: These are instinctual, genetically predetermined behaviors that an animal is born with and does not require learning or experience. For example, reflex actions like a frog snapping its tongue to catch a fly or a newborn turtle moving towards the ocean are innate behaviors. 2. Learned behavior: These behaviors are acquired or modified during an animal's lifetime based on experience and interaction with their environment. Learning can result from direct experience (like a dog learning not to pull on its leash), observing other animals (such as young birds learning to sing or hunt from their parents), or conditioning (where an animal learns to associate a stimulus with a certain response). 3. Social behavior: This refers to the interactions between animals of the same species, which can include cooperative behaviors (such as meerkats taking turns watching for predators), complex communication (for example, the elaborate dances and songs of some bird species), altruistic behaviors (actions that benefit other individuals at a possible cost to the performer), and competition for resources or mates. 4. Foraging behavior: This describes the strategies that animals use to find, capture, and consume food. There are various foraging behaviors, ranging from hunting and ambushing prey (as seen in lions or spiders) to grazing (like in cows or sheep) and cooperative hunting (observed in wolves or dolphins). 5. Mating behavior: The complex set of behaviors related to reproduction, including courtship displays, mating rituals, and parental care. Examples include the colorful displays of peacock feathers to attract a mate, the extensive nest-building by some bird species, and the protective instincts of mother mammals towards their offspring. 6. Migration behavior: Many animal species undertake seasonal or periodic journeys over long distances in response to factors such as changes in food availability, temperature, or breeding conditions. Some well-known examples include the annual migration of wildebeest herds across the Serengeti or the incredible journeys undertaken by certain bird species like the Arctic tern, which migrates from the Arctic to the Antarctic each year. In conclusion, the term for any way that an animal interacts with other animals or the environment is \\"behavior,\\" a complex and diverse set of actions and responses that helps animals adapt and thrive in their particular surroundings. By studying animal behavior, researchers can gain valuable insights into the way animals communicate, learn, form social structures, and navigate their environment, contributing to our broader understanding of the natural world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use four to five boxes (400-500 grams) of cassia powder for long hair. Mix into henna powder three teaspoons of amla powder, one teaspoon of coffee powder, and a little bit of curd or plain yogurt. Stir the ingredients well. Slowly add one to two cups of hot water (not boiling) to the henna paste in a bowl until the paste is thick, not runny. Mix the contents. Close the bowl with a lid or tight plastic wrap. Let it sit for twelve hours to twenty-four hours, unrefrigerated before using it on your hair. Amla (Indian gooseberry) is nondrying and adds coolness to the red so that it is not quite so bright. You can omit the amla if you want a very vibrant orange-red. Amla volumizes hair as well as enhances texture and curls. Use 100 grams of henna powder for hair up to medium length, or 200 grams of henna for long hair. Henna can be drying, so you may want to add a conditioner to the paste the next morning, such as two to three tablespoons of olive oil and 1/5 cup moisturizing conditioner. Once henna paste has sat for twelve to twenty-four hours, mix in indigo powder well. If the paste is not the consistency of thick yogurt, add warm water little by little until you achieve the right texture. Let the paste sit for fifteen minutes. If you have short hair, use one box (100 grams) of indigo. If you have shoulder-length hair, use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of indigo. If you have long hair, use four to five boxes (400 to 500 grams) of indigo. Put gloves on. Section your hair and apply the paste to damp or dry hair with your gloved hands, a pastry brush, or a coloring brush from a beauty supply store. Make sure that you cover all of your hair to the roots. You may find it handy to clip sections of hair back once you've finished coating them. Henna paste is thick, so don't try to rake it through your hair. Apply the paste to the roots of your hair first, since that is typically where the most hue and processing time is needed. If you have long hair, you may want to pull it up first into a clip. Use plastic wrap or a shower cap to protect the dye. For red hair, leave the paste on for about four hours. For brown or black hair, leave the paste in your hair for one to six hours. You can check the color by scraping off a little bit of the henna to see the result. When you've reached your desired color, you can rinse off the henna. Wear gloves when you're rinsing out the dye, or it will stain your hands. Use a mild shampoo to wash your hair. You can use moisturizing conditioner afterwards if desired. For red hair, you can dry and style as usual. For black hair, you'll follow this with indigo dye. Add warm water to indigo powder little by little until you achieve a yogurt-like consistency. Mix in one teaspoon of salt per 100 grams of indigo powder. Let the paste sit for fifteen minutes. Apply the paste to damp or dry hair. Wear gloves. Put the paste on in sections, starting at the back of your head and moving forward. Coat the hair thoroughly to the roots. For short hair, use one box (100 grams) of indigo. For shoulder-length hair, use two to three boxes (200-300 grams) of indigo. For long hair, use four to five boxes (400 to 500 grams) of indigo. Once your hair is saturated with the paste, use a clip or hair pin to put your hair up. Wrap plastic wrap or a shower cap over your head. Let the paste sit in your hair for one to two hours. After one to two hours of processing time, rinse the paste completely out. You can use conditioner if desired. Dry and style your hair as usual.

Geben Sie Thomas Celano in das Such-Eingabefeld ein. Translate to English English:","completion":"Enter Thomas Celano into the search input field. Thomas Celano (c.1190–c.1260), also known as Thomas of Celano, was an Italian friar, theologian, and writer of the Franciscan Order. He is best known for his two biographies of Saint Francis of Assisi: the First Life, or \\"Vita Prima,\\" and the Second Life, or \\"Vita Secunda.\\" Both biographies provide valuable insights into the life and work of Saint Francis, the founder of the Franciscan Order, and the development of the early Franciscan movement. Born in Celano, Italy, he joined the Franciscan Order in 1215, when the Order was still in its infancy, under the guidance of Saint Francis himself. Thomas soon became one of Francis' closest companions and played a significant role in the development of the Order. He was an eyewitness to many of Francis' miracles, making his biographies of the saint a vital historical resource. Thomas was commissioned to write the First Life of Francis by Pope Gregory IX in 1228, following Francis' canonization. The First Life offers a hagiographic account of the saint's life and adheres to the conventions of the medieval genre. It presents Francis' life chronologically, detailing his early life, conversion, founding of the Franciscan Order, his ministry, miracles, and his death in 1226. Despite its hagiographic approach, it remains an essential source of information about Saint Francis' life and the early years of the Franciscan Order. In 1244, Thomas wrote the Second Life, which includes additional information and anecdotes about the saint that was not present in the First Life. The Second Life was written at the request of the Minister General of the Franciscan Order, Crescentius of Jessi, who was dissatisfied with the First Life's lack of detail about Francis' spiritual life and teachings. In contrast to the First Life, the Second Life explores Francis' spiritual growth and development in greater depth, focusing on the emotional and spiritual aspects of his life, while maintaining the chronological structure. In addition to the biographies of Saint Francis, Thomas was a noted poet and author, credited with composing the renowned \\"Dies Irae\\" hymn, a piece used in both the Roman Catholic and other Christian liturgies. The hymn, which reflects on the Day of Judgment, showcases Thomas' skill as a poet and deep religious thinker. In conclusion, Thomas Celano was an essential figure within the early Franciscan Order and contributed greatly to our understanding of Saint Francis of Assisi and the early development of the Order. Through his biographies and other writings, Thomas has provided valuable historical resources and insights into the spiritual and communal aspects of the Franciscan movement, which have continued to inspire countless individuals for centuries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
