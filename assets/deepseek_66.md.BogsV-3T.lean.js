There has, however, been interest among railroad operators in returning to DC use at higher voltages than previously used. At the same voltage, DC often has less loss than AC, and for this reason high-voltage direct current is already used on some bulk power transmission lines. DC avoids the electromagnetic radiation inherent with AC, and on a railway this also reduces interference with signalling and communications and mitigates hypothetical EMF risks. DC also avoids the power factor problems of AC. Of particular interest to railroading is that DC can supply constant power with a single ungrounded wire. Constant power with AC requires three-phase transmission with at least two ungrounded wires. Another important consideration is that mains-frequency 3-phase AC must be carefully planned to avoid unbalanced phase loads. Parts of the system are supplied from different phases on the assumption that the total loads of the 3 phases will even out. At the phase break points between regions supplied from different phases, long insulated supply breaks are required to avoid them being shorted by rolling stock using more than one pantograph at a time. A few railroads have tried 3-phase but its substantial complexity has made single-phase standard practice despite the interruption in power flow that occurs twice every cycle.

Article: He’ll still sit court side at Los Angeles Lakers’ games, but Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson has quietly retired from the movie business, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned. The 76-year-old icon has no plans to appear in films again after a career spanning five decades. “Jack has — without fanfare — retired,” a well-placed Hollywood film insider confirmed to Radar. “There is a simple reason behind his decision — it’s memory loss. Quite frankly, at 76, Jack has memory issues and can no longer remember the lines being asked of him. PHOTOS: Jack Nicholson Flirts With Jennifer Lawrence “His memory isn’t what it used to be.” The three-time Academy Award winner has not worked since How Do You Know in 2010 starring Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd and Owen Wilson. Tellingly, producers for the forthcoming film Nebraska had wanted him to play the key role of an aging, booze-addled father who makes the trip from Montana to Nebraska with his estranged son in order to claim a million dollar Mega Sweepstakes Marketing prize. The role ultimately went to Bruce Dern, after Nicholson advised the filmmakers that he was not interested, the source said. PHOTOS: Jack Nicholson And Kevin Garnett At A Laker’s Game Nicholson began his Hollywood career in the 1950s, first working as a gofer for animation legends William Hanna and Joseph Barbera at the MGM cartoon studio. He left soon after to pursue his dream to star on screen. The New Jersey-native made his film debut in a low-budget teen drama The Cry Baby Killer, in 1958, playing the title role. He’s best remembered for his Academy Award winning roles as Best Actor for One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and for As Good as It Gets. He also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1983 film Terms of Endearment. Nicholson has been nominated for a record-setting 12 Oscars, eight for Best Actor and four for Best Supporting Actor, making him the most nominated male actor in Academy Awards history. PHOTOS: Stars Who Have Been Arrested “Jack has no intention of retiring from the limelight,” said the source, who noted his regular appearances on the Hollywood party circuit, court side at his beloved Lakers and his co-presentation of the Academy Award for Best Picture with First Lady Michelle Obama, earlier this year. “He’s not retiring from public life, at all. He just doesn’t want a tribute,” added the insider. “He’s happy to tacitly join the retirees club like Sean Connery.” ||||| Has Easy Rider star Jack Nicholson decided to ride off into that sunset known as retirement? Rumors that the three-time Oscar winner was hanging up his acting hat started running rampant on Wednesday, Sept. 4, after a report surfaced claiming the 76-year-old Hollywood legend was doing just that. The apparent reason? Memory loss. However, it appears such speculation may have simply originated from the cuckoo's nest. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Hollywood legend Jack Nicholson has reportedly retired from the movie business at the age of 76 due to memory loss issues.

Which team contributed to strengthening the soil? The two teams took different approaches in reinforcing the highway embankment slopes when building segments of the interstate. Team A led by Chuck relied almost entirely on inspiration and good building materials therefore decreasing slope stability, while team B lead by Mike used nature as an ally by planting tens of thousands of trees and shrubs to prevent slope failures and moderate soil transpiration and evaporation. Hint: The major effect of transpiration is the reduction of soil pore water pressures which counteracts the loss of strength which occurs through wetting, this is most readily seen as a loss of moisture around trees. However it is not easy to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the undrained shear strength, the effective shear stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.[2][3] The answer is:","completion":"Team B lead by Mike"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You take a tray - Add water into the tray - You insert the tray into a freezer - The water molecules begin to slow down - The water becomes ice - The ice cubes are ready. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose water surface solidifies in ice tray happens, how will it affect LESS ice cubes being made. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis in which the water surface solidifies in the ice tray does have both direct and indirect effects on the process of ice cube formation, ultimately leading to less ice cubes being made. To understand the connection, let's break down the process and analyze the changes caused by the perturbation. When the water surface solidifies in the process, it creates a layer of ice that restricts the normal progress of water molecules slowing down and forming ice. This phenomenon has several direct and indirect consequences on the process: 1. Direct effect: Slower heat transfer The solidified ice layer acts as a barrier between the colder air in the freezer and the water underneath. This layer of ice hinders the process of heat transfer from the water to the surrounding air, slowing down the cooling process. The water underneath the layer remains insulated and takes longer to cool, leading to less ice cubes being made in a given time compared to the unperturbed process. 2. Direct effect: Incomplete ice cube formation In an ice tray, the partitions are designed to separate the individual ice cubes. When a solidified water surface forms, it can prevent the water from reaching these partitions. As a result, the ice formed underneath the surface layer may not have clearly defined edges, leading to imperfect or incomplete ice cubes. In this case, the total number of individually usable ice cubes will be less compared to the normal process. 3. Indirect effect: Overfilling or spillage risk To ensure adequate water is available to form ice cubes under the layer, a user might overfill the ice tray to compensate for the solidified surface layer. However, this could lead to spillage during insertion into the freezer or while pulling the tray out. The spillage might reduce the water volume in the tray and affect the number of ice cubes formed. 4. Indirect effect: Increased energy consumption When a solidified ice surface forms in the tray, it prolongs the time required for the water to freeze completely. Consequently, the freezer needs to work harder and use more energy to maintain the low temperatures necessary for ice formation. Over time, this added energy consumption could lead to wear on the freezer components, indirectly affecting the efficiency of the ice-making process. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis in which the water surface solidifies in the ice tray does have a significant impact on the process of ice cube formation, both directly and indirectly. This phenomenon can lead to slower cooling, inadequate formation of ice cubes, increased risks of spillage, and higher energy consumption, ultimately resulting in fewer ice cubes being produced compared to the normal freezing process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Screeching Weasel is an American punk rock band originally from the Chicago suburb of Prospect Heights, Illinois. The band was formed in 1986 by Ben Weasel and John Jughead. Since their formation, Screeching Weasel have broken up and reformed numerous times with numerous line-up changes. Ben Weasel has been the only constant member, though Jughead was present in every incarnation of the band until 2009. The band originally called themselves All Night Garage Sale but changed their name to Screeching Weasel, a variation of a name a friend had suggested, Screaming Otter, which was a reference to a T-shirt that read, \\"I'VE GOT A SCREAMING OTTER IN MY PANTS!\\". Shortly after their formation, Weasel decided that it was too difficult to play bass and sing at the same time, so Vince Vogel, who took the stage name \\"Vinnie Bovine\\" joined as the band's bassist. The band recorded their debut album, Screeching Weasel, in one night for 200 and released it on Chicago label Underdog Records in 1987. In 1988, Bovine was fired from the band and was replaced with Warren Fischer, better known as Fish, and former member of the band Ozzfish. The band recorded their second studio album, Boogadaboogadaboogada!, which featured Weasel playing second guitar (he would later state that he only played on about a quarter of the songs) and made a name for themselves by opening a show for Operation Ivy at 924 Gilman Street. Steve Cheese was fired from the band shortly after the recording due to his unwillingness to tour outside of Chicago. He was replaced by Aaron Cometbus for two shows who then was replaced by Brian Vermin. Boogadaboogadaboogada! was released in late 1988 on Roadkill Records, a label formed by investor David Best and managed by Ben Weasel following an introduction of the two by producer Mass Giorgini. After what Weasel described as a \\"disastrous\\" tour, Fish left the group and was replaced by Dan Schafer, originally nicknamed \\"Sewercap\\" and later renamed Danny Vapid. The new band members recorded an extended play entitled Punkhouse for Limited Potential Records soon after that. The band ended up recording four more songs in 1989 that were featured on compilations, featuring a second guitarist Doug Ward, who also joined the band for several live performances. Screeching Weasel disbanded when Vermin and Vapid stated that they wanted to leave the band to concentrate on their side project, Sludgeworth. Did anyone else leave?","completion":"Yes, according to the article, several members of the band Screeching Weasel left over the years.

Question: When I first started out in the field, I was working at a private hospital in the locked psychiatric unit, and there was a call from one of the med floors requiring someone from our unit to assist with a problem of a young man who had bitten through his cotton restraints on his wrists. They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless. I recall being plagued by this young man’s face for some time when I tried to go to sleep at night.

Answer:","completion":"\\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" is a popular song from the 1960 British musical \\"Oliver!\\", with music and lyrics by Lionel Bart. The song is performed by the character Nancy, a complex and troubled young woman who is deeply involved with the main antagonist, Bill Sikes. Nancy's love for him, despite his abusive behavior, is portrayed in the lyrics and emotions of the song. In the original 1960 West End production of \\"Oliver!\\", the role of Nancy was played by Georgia Brown, who was the first to perform \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" on stage. Brown's performance made the song quite well-known, and her rendition is still remembered today. The first Broadway production of \\"Oliver!\\" took place in 1963, wherein Nancy was portrayed by actress and singer Georgia Brown once again, meaning Brown was responsible for introducing the song to both British and American audiences. In the 1968 film adaptation of \\"Oliver!\\", the character of Nancy was portrayed by Shani Wallis, an English actress, and singer. Consequently, Wallis is the one who sang \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" in the movie. Her performance of the song became one of the film's highlights and was instrumental in earning its Academy Award for Best Picture. Throughout the decades since its inception, \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" has been performed in numerous stage productions by various actresses, each bringing their unique touch to the song and the character of Nancy. Some notable actresses who have portrayed Nancy and sung \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\" include: 1. Ruthie Henshall in the 1994 London Palladium revival. 2. Kerry Ellis in the BBC TV show \\"I'd Do Anything\\" in 2008, in which young talents competed to be cast as Nancy in a West End production. 3. Jodie Prenger, who won the \\"I'd Do Anything\\" competition and played Nancy in the 2009 West End production. 4. Leanne Jones in the 2011 UK tour of \\"Oliver!\\". 5. Samantha Barks, who played Nancy in the 2011 production at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane. There have also been various concert and charity performances where singers, both professional and amateur, have showcased their renditions of \\"As Long As He Needs Me\\". As the song remains an important piece in the musical theater repertoire, it will likely continue to be performed by different artists for many years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? gaping plot holes sink this \` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .","completion":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence appears to be negative. This can be assessed by examining the specific words and phrases used, as they contribute to the overall tone and feelings conveyed by the author towards the movie. Firstly, the phrase \\"gaping plot holes\\" suggests that the movie has significant flaws in its storyline, which the author thinks are difficult to ignore. This signals dissatisfaction and disappointment with the plot, highlighting a critical view of the movie. Secondly, the term \\"sub-standard thriller\\" further underlines the negative sentiment. The descriptor \\"sub-standard\\" implies that the movie does not meet the author’s expectations, and delivers a below-average performance for a thriller. This again communicates dissatisfaction with the movie, reinforcing the negative sentiment expressed earlier. Next, the choice of words \\"sink\\" and \\"drag\\" convey the idea that the movie is not only failing to meet the audience's expectation but is actively pulling down their enthusiasm. This use of metaphor presents the movie as a hindrance to enjoyment rather than a source of entertainment. The phrase \\"crush depth\\" refers to the deep-sea scenario where a submarine can be destroyed by the water pressure it is subjected to. In this context, the author metaphorically claims that the audience enthusiasm is being dragged down to such a low point that it is practically being crushed. This gives a strong sense of negativity. Considering all these elements together, it is evident that the sentiment of the movie review sentence is negative. The reviewer emphasizes that the movie is plagued with numerous issues that result in decreased audience enthusiasm, delivering a crushing blow to the overall enjoyment of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As a figure of speech, what is something hinted or implied without being definitely stated?","completion":"In figurative language or speech, when something is hinted at or implied without being expressly stated, it is termed as \\"Innuendo\\". Innuendo is a communication technique and a figure of speech that involves implying or indirectly alluding to something, such as an idea, piece of information, or fact, without explicitly saying it. This is done via insinuation or suggestion, using cunning, clever or ambiguous language. The underlying message is intricately woven into the fabric of the conversation or discourse, allowing the speaker to convey their thoughts without actually voicing them directly. Innuendos can be used for a variety of intents. Some people use innuendo to tactfully express criticism or disapproval, to indirectly persuade or influence others, or to subtly insert humor or irony into their speak. Political discourse and satirical works are two arenas where innuendo is frequently used to indirectly communicate contentious or sensitive subjects. However, it is important to tread carefully when using innuendo, as its suggestive and indirect nature can often lead to misunderstanding, misinterpretation, or even offense. A certain level of familiarity with the subject, conversational context, and shared understanding between the speaker and listener is crucial for innuendo to be effectively communicated and understood. Moreover, innuendo also often plays a vital role in literary works, enhancing the depth and complexity of characters and dialogues and adding layers to plotlines. It's used frequently in different forms of literature to create suspense, develop alternative interpretations, and unveil revelations gradually. For example, in Shakespeare's plays, innuendo was often utilized to introduce sexual undertones, expressing the forbidden or risqué elements of affection and desire. In general, innuendo is a delicate yet powerful device in the realm of rhetoric and communication, capable of shaping the whole dynamic of a conversation or narrative. Its strength lies in its subtlety and the skill with which it is implanted and it persists to be a compelling feature of modern and traditional forms of communication and storytelling alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Musial was born in Donora, Pennsylvania, the fifth of the six children (four girls and two boys) of Lukasz and Mary (Lancos) Musial (, MOO-show). His mother was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent and his father was a Polish immigrant who chose the name Stanislaw Franciszek for his first son, though his father always referred to Musial using the Polish nickname Stasiu, pronounced \\"Stashu\\". Musial frequently played baseball with his brother Ed and other friends during his childhood, and considered Lefty Grove his favorite ballplayer. Musial also had the benefit of learning about baseball from his neighbor Joe Barbao, a former minor league pitcher. Musial began the 1950s by posting a .350 batting average before participating in the 1950 All-Star Game, where in fan balloting he was the NL's number two choice. He had the longest hitting streak of his career during the 1950 season--a 30-game stretch that ended on July 27. With the Cardinals falling 14 games out of first place by September, manager Dyer used him at first base and all three outfield positions. New Cardinals manager Marty Marion led the team to a third-place finish in 1951, while Musial was named The Sporting News Major League Player of the Year. National media attention inadvertently turned to Musial a month before the 1952 season began, after Ty Cobb wrote an article regarding modern baseball players that was published in Life magazine. Cobb singled out Musial and Phil Rizzuto as the only players \\"who can be mentioned in the same breath with the oldtime greats\\". Cobb went on to refer to Musial as \\"a better player than Joe DiMaggio was in his prime.\\" In response, Musial displayed his characteristic modesty, saying, \\"Cobb is baseball's greatest. I don't want to contradict him, but I can't say that I was ever as good as Joe DiMaggio.\\" The only major league pitching appearance of Musial's career occurred as a publicity stunt during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed for the first time in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career. The Cardinals franchise was up for sale in early 1953, and Musial and Schoendienst advised their friend and fellow duck-hunter Gussie Busch to consider buying the team. Busch used the resources of the Anheuser-Busch company to purchase the Cardinals, keeping Musial in St. Louis by averting the possibility of a move by the team to another city. The 1953 season marked Musial's 10th NL All-Star selection, and the 12th consecutive time he finished a major league season with a batting average above .300. Musial accomplished another historical feat on May 2, 1954, in a doubleheader in St. Louis against the New York Giants: he hit three home runs in the first contest, then added two more in the second to become the first major leaguer to hit five home runs in a doubleheader. In addition to his five home runs, he also hit a single in the first game, setting a new record of 21 total bases for a doubleheader. The only player besides Musial to hit five home runs in a doubleheader is Nate Colbert, who achieved the feat in 1972. what was this feat?","completion":"Musial, a baseball player, did something amazing on May 2, 1954. He played in two different games on the same day, which is called a doubleheader. In the first game, he hit three home runs, and in the second game, he hit two more home runs. So, he hit a total of five home runs in both games.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.).

News article: Bill Gates urges China's wealthiest to give to charity Bill Gates: 'Returns from investing in poor people are just as great as [returns] from investing in the business world.' Photograph: Mehdi Taamallah/AFP/Getty Images Bill Gates has urged China's extraordinarily wealthy business elite to shed its aversion to philanthropy and donate to the poor, a potent message in one of the world's most economically divided societies. \\"Only when we help poor people break away from destitution and illness can the whole world achieve sustainable development,\\" Gates wrote in the People's Daily, a mouthpiece of the country's top leadership. \\"Investing in poor people requires the involvement of every social strata. I believe that the returns from investing in poor people are just as great as [returns] from investing in the business world, and have even more meaning.\\" China had 358 billionaires at the end of 2013 – a rise of 41 over the previous year and the second-most of any country in the world, after the US. Yet in terms of charitable giving, it ranks among the world's worst. According to the World Giving Index 2013, an annual survey by the NGO Charities Aid Foundation (pdf) (pdf), China ranked 115 among 135 countries for donating money and last for volunteering. Income inequality counts among the country's most pressing social ills. According to a 2012 survey by Peking University, families in China's cities and coastal provinces earn significantly more than their rural and inland counterparts. An average Shanghai household, for example, brings in £2,790 a year, while an average family in the inland province Gansu makes less than £1,200. While handfuls of individuals have profited enormously from China's economic boom, few have shown willing to share their wealth. In 2010, Gates, who runs the 38bn Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the American business magnate Warren Buffet asked 50 of China's richest people to join a charity dinner in Beijing. Many turned down the invitation, reportedly because they were uncomfortable being asked for donations. Yet the country's philanthropic record is slowly improving. On Friday, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, co-founders of Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce company, announced plans to fund a 3bn foundation, the country's largest. The amount represents about 2% of the company's equity, all of it from the founders' shares. According to state media, the foundation will focus on environment, education and healthcare. Yet other details, such as its name and how the money will be distributed, remain unclear. Ma, China's eighth richest man, stepped down as Alibaba's CEO last year and has since dedicated much of his time to charity efforts. He sits on the Nature Conservancy's board of directors and helps lead kung fu star Jet Li's One Foundation. \\"When you register a new foundation in China you need a supervisory agency, so a lot of people have worried that by registering a private foundation they'd be giving up control over their personal wealth,\\" said Anthony Spires, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who researches China's civil society. \\"Many of these folks are used to being in charge – they have very clear issues that concern them … and they don't want the government to tell them how to spend their money.\\" Spires called the size of the promised foundation \\"staggering\\". \\"This will be the largest foundation in China, if they really do it,\\" he said. \\"It's on par with Michael Bloomberg's philanthropy.\\" Alibaba is preparing a high-profile initial public offering on the New York stock exchange. Analysts expect the company to be valued at more than 100bn, which would make its IPO one of the biggest in history. \\"My wife and I had this thought of setting up a personal charitable fund when we started the business,\\" Ma, 49, told the state newswire Xinhua. \\"We'd like to earn money before we turn 50 years old and do charitable work in our time after 50.\\" Gates has responded to Ma's announcement, saying that the foundation will \\"do an immense amount of good, particularly in this remarkable time in the development of philanthropy in China\\", the newswire reported. Warren Buffet has called the two Alibaba founders \\"extraordinary leaders in business [who] have now become leaders in philanthropy\\". What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article primarily focuses on the call made by Bill Gates for China's wealthiest individuals to increase their contributions to charity. Mr. Gates emphasized that the returns from investing in poor people can be just as rewarding as those from the business world. The context for this message is the significant economic disparity in China, where a rising number of billionaires coexists with poverty, especially in rural and inland areas. This socioeconomic imbalance makes philanthropic activity critical for sustainable development of the country. Unfortunately, according to the World Giving Index 2013, China ranks poorly when it comes to charitable giving and volunteering, despite boasting the second largest number of billionaires in the world. The reluctance of these wealthy individuals to donate was notably demonstrated in 2010, when many declined an invitation from Gates and Warren Buffet to a charity dinner in Beijing due to unease about donation requests. However, the article reveals a possible positive change. Alibaba’s co-founders, Jack Ma and Joe Tsai, announced the formation of a 3bn foundation, set to focus on environment, education, and healthcare – the largest in the country. This initiative was acknowledged by Gates and Buffet as a significant step in Chinese philanthropy. The way philanthropists in China operate is also discussed, as Prof. Anthony Spires notes that many wealthy individuals in China resist registering private foundations due to worries about surrendering control over their personal wealth to government agencies. Overall, the news article highlights a pressing issue in China's socio-economic landscape in light of its increasing income disparity, and illustrates some of the active steps being taken by influential figures to encourage philanthropy and charitable donations among China's richest citizens."},{"prompt":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the two commanding officers who were involved with the surprise capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775? ? Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack. Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...","completion":"The full names of the two commanding officers involved with the surprise capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775 are Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"From the given information, it is not possible to directly determine if the first sentence's validity has any effect on the truth value of the second sentence. Each of these two sentences express different thoughts and should be analyzed independently, taking into consideration context, underlying assumptions, and possible implications of each. Sentence 1: \\"yeah yeah that's what i don't understand\\" This sentence suggests the speaker agrees with a previous statement or acknowledges the sentiment, but also highlights a lack of understanding about a certain aspect. To determine the truth of this statement, it is essential to be aware of the subject matter and context to which this sentence corresponds. Assessing the truth of this statement depends on whether the speaker genuinely does not understand a particular topic or point. Sentence 2: \\"I don't get why we're not paid better.\\" This sentence expresses the speaker's opinion on not being paid well enough, possibly indicating dissatisfaction with their current compensation. In this case, determining the truth value of the statement is more subjective, as it is based on the speaker's perception of their pay. Factors that could be considered to gauge the validity of this statement include salary comparisons within the same industry, company and region, and taking into account qualifications, experience, and job performance. In short, the first sentence's truth value does not influence the truth value of the second sentence directly, as they address distinct subjects—one is about a lack of understanding, while the other revolves around personal opinions on compensation.

Here is a goal: bat Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? A. can obliterate plastic toy B. can obliterate house","completion":"In comparing option A \\"can obliterate a plastic toy\\" and option B \\"can obliterate a house\\" with the goal to \\"bat\\", it's essential to understand the context in which the term \\"bat\\" is used. Often, \\"bat\\" refers to an implement with a handle and a solid surface, typically of wood, used for hitting the ball in games such as baseball, cricket, or table tennis. If \\"bat\\" means to strike or hit in the context of this goal, then option A \\"can obliterate a plastic toy\\" makes more sense to achieve this goal. In fact, a bat, particularly a baseball bat or cricket bat, could conceivably be used to strike and potentially break or \\"obliterate\\" a plastic toy. This type of action is physically feasible and in line with the typical use of a bat. On the other hand, option B \\"can obliterate a house” is a less realistic or practical method to utilize a bat. The term \\"obliterate\\" implies complete destruction or wiping out of existence. A house, made of materials like brick, concrete, or wood, would be highly resistant to destruction by a bat. It'd be nearly impossible to obliterate a house using a bat due to the significant difference in structure and strength between a bat and a house. The action not only deviates from normal use of a bat, but it also conjures images of excessive, unrealistic destruction. Therefore, when the goal is to \\"bat\\" and options A and B are evaluated, option A is far more attainable and reasonable. This conclusion assumes typical uses and physical capabilities of a bat, along with ordinary understandings of the objects (a plastic toy and a house) involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: what super bowl did the eagles play in?","completion":"The Philadelphia Eagles have played in three Super Bowl games throughout their history in the National Football League (NFL). 1. Super Bowl XV: The Eagles played in their first Super Bowl on January 25, 1981, against the Oakland Raiders at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. Under the guidance of head coach Dick Vermeil, the Eagles faced a tough Raiders team led by head coach Tom Flores. The Raiders emerged victorious with a final score of 27-10. Philadelphia quarterback Ron Jaworski threw for 291 passing yards and one touchdown but couldn't overcome the strong Raiders defense that intercepted him three times during the game. 2. Super Bowl XXXIX: The Eagles' second Super Bowl appearance came on February 6, 2005, when they faced the New England Patriots at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. Coached by Andy Reid, the Eagles were seen as the underdogs against the Patriots, led by head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. Despite a valiant effort by Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who threw for 357 yards and three touchdowns, the Patriots won their third Super Bowl in four years with a final score of 24-21. McNabb's three interceptions and the Eagles' late-game clock mismanagement proved too costly for them to overcome. 3. Super Bowl LII: The Eagles played in their third Super Bowl on February 4, 2018, against the New England Patriots at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This time, the Eagles were led by head coach Doug Pederson and backup quarterback Nick Foles, who stepped in for the injured Carson Wentz. In a thrilling offensive battle, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl with a final score of 41-33. Foles, who threw for 373 yards and three touchdowns, was named Super Bowl MVP. The game featured several memorable moments, including Foles' touchdown reception on a trick play called the \\"Philly Special,\\" and defensive end Brandon Graham's late-game strip-sack of Tom Brady, which helped seal the victory for Philadelphia.

Post-Katrina, Andy and Stan are now partners. They work with corrupt detectives Pepe and Barney, who are caught up in the murder of an undercover narcotics agent. Investigating the escalating police corruption in New Orleans is FBI Agent Brown. Brown brings up his thoughts to Police Captain Friendly who insists he is doing his best to solve the problems in his department. Meanwhile, police therapist Nina Ferraro tries to help the detectives with their struggles, with little avail. She is particularly interested in Andy, whose father, also a detective, was murdered in the line of duty. Things are complicated further with Agent Brown's investigation into Andy and his crew.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology. But I can use this background: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13 cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. What is an answer for this question: Which person learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? The answer is:","completion":"It is difficult to definitively say which geologist, Barry or Will, learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge without knowing the specifics of their individual studies and experiences. However, based on their areas of specialization, some general assumptions can be made. Barry, as a geologist specializing in subduction zones and new seafloors, likely has deeper knowledge and understanding of processes occurring at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is an active spreading center where new oceanic crust is created, which falls directly into Barry's area of expertise. He probably has studied the formation of new seafloor, the spreading rates of mid-ocean ridges (slow-spreading for the Mid-Atlantic Ridge), the geochemistry of basalts produced, and how these features contribute to the overall geology of the region. On the other hand, Will specializes in montology, which typically studies the formation and characteristics of mountains. While some aspects of montology might be relevant to the study of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, such as how the ridge's axial high might contribute to the geological features of the region, his focus is likely more on the formation and development of mountains rather than the specific processes occurring at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Considering their respective specializations, it would be reasonable to suggest that Will may have learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge compared to Barry. Barry's specialization in subduction zones and new seafloors directly relates to the geologic processes happening at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, whereas Will's focus on montology might offer a more limited overlap with the topic. However, it is essential to remember that the true extent of their knowledge would depend on their individual experiences, investigations, and studies throughout their careers as geologists."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: Guns N’ Roses, the Beastie Boys, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eric B. & Rakim and the Cure are among the 15 nominees for induction as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s class of 2012. In addition, ‘70s female-fronted rock acts Heart and Joan Jett & the Blackhearts are under consideration along with singer-songwriter Laura Nyro, disco queen Donna Summer, R&B collective War and British rock group Small Faces. Blues guitarist and singer Freddie King, R&B band the Spinners and Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan round out the latest batch of Hall of Fame nominees. Inductees are typically announced in December, ahead of a ceremony that takes place in New York in March. At least 25 years must have elapsed since a musician or group released its debut recording for the act to be eligible for induction. That makes Guns N’ Roses eligible for the first time because the L.A. hard rock outfit’s debut album, “Appetite for Destruction,” was released in 1987. Likewise, this is the first year of eligibility for rap duo Eric B. & Rakim, whose debut, “Paid in Full,” also appeared in 1987. King and Donovan are the senior members of this year’s nominees, having released their first recordings in 1961 and 1965, respectively. Because of the rancor over the years between Guns N' Roses founding member Axl Rose and former members of the band who have since departed, including guitarist Slash, the group's induction sets up the prospect of a dramatic reunion, if all parties opt to set aside their differences for the occasion. In a similar situation, Creedence Clearwater Revival singer, guitarist and songwriter John Fogerty refused to join with the Bay Area band's surviving members -- bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford -- when Creedence was inducted in 1993.

Article: Look at the cat on the left. Find anything strange? In 1961, a man found a strange cat on his farm in Scotland. The cat's ears were folded , bent forward, on its head. In fact, this was a new kind of cat. People named it the \\"Scottish Fold\\". The Scottish Fold has a round head and big eyes. Its neck and legs are short. They make it look very lovely. Interestingly, all the Scottish Folds are born with straight and unfolded ears. And when they are growing up day by day, some cats' ears will begin to fold. So, the Scottish Fold comes in two types: folded ears and straight ears. There is a nickname for the Scottish Fold. It is the \\"Messenger of Peace\\". Why?

Given the question: Title: Excellent, riveting, disturbing Product review: I'm a fan of Moseley's non-Easy Rawlins' works. I read Futureland earlier this year and when I saw that his latest novel, THE MAN IN MY BASEMENT, was not part of his mystery series I grabbed it from my local library. This novel is mesmerizing---I read it very nearly straight through. The main character Charles is despicable in many ways---lazy, selfish, corrupt, a thief, a womanizer---and yet Moseley makes us like him---mostly because Charles is very, very funny.Mr. Bennet, who Charles agrees to allow to stay in his basement in a makeshift prison cell in exchange for a pile of cash, on the other hand, is pure evil. Compared to Bennet, Charles is a saint, and as Charles gets to know just how evil Bennet is, it helps bring about his own redemption. The kinds of evil Bennet is involved in gives me chills even several weeks after reading the book. An excellent study in the real definition of evil and responsibility. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: This review depicts the product in a flattering light.

Step 3: Consider the overall impression the review gives - The reviewer shares praise for the novel, mentions reading it very nearly straight through, and discusses the thought-provoking themes of evil and responsibility. Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis - Since the positive points outweigh any negative points and the overall impression of the review is positive, it can be concluded that the review depicts the product in a flattering light."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Daphniphyllum is the sole genus in the flowering plant family Daphniphyllaceae and was described as a genus in 1826. The genus includes evergreen shrubs and trees mainly native to east and southeast Asia, but also found in the Indian Subcontinent and New Guinea. Hypothesis: Daphniphyllum may someday be found in North America.","completion":"To evaluate the hypothesis that Daphniphyllum may someday be found in North America, we need to consider several aspects, including its native habitat, adaptability, and potential routes of introduction to North America. While the future cannot be predicted with certainty, we can provide analysis based on the available information. Daphniphyllum, as mentioned, is native to eastern and southeastern Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, and New Guinea. According to the information provided, it has not been discovered in North America to date. These plants are mainly found in regions with specific climates and conditions, such as warm, humid environments. Adaptability is a critical factor in determining if a species can someday be found in a new location. Some plants are highly adaptable and can grow in various conditions outside their native range, whereas others have specific needs that must be met to thrive. In the case of Daphniphyllum, the plant's preferred climate suggests it might be challenging to adapt to the wide-ranging climates of North America. Nonetheless, microclimates within North America might possess suitable conditions for its growth, such as the Pacific Northwest or southeastern United States, where warm and humid conditions prevail. A potential route for Daphniphyllum to be introduced to North America could be through human intervention. This might happen if the plant were brought intentionally for gardening purposes or by accident as a stowaway on imported goods. Governments and organizations often have measures in place to prevent the accidental introduction of non-native species, but it is still possible for a species to find its way to a new continent. Another possible route for Daphniphyllum to reach North America is through natural means, such as bird dispersal, ocean current movements, or through natural disasters. However, considering the significant geographical barriers and distance between the native regions of Daphniphyllum and North America, natural means of introduction are less likely. In conclusion, while it cannot be definitively confirmed or denied that Daphniphyllum may someday be found in North America, several factors need to be considered. Given the plant's native range, preferred climate, and the likelihood of introduction to North America through human intervention or natural means, it is possible, although not very probable, that Daphniphyllum might eventually find its way to North America. Suitable microclimates in North America might support its growth if it ever reaches the continent, but the likelihood remains relatively low based on the current understanding and information about this genus."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The left side of the equation has both 996*m and -923*m, which can be combined. (996 - 923)*m + 73 = 0 73*m + 73 = 0 Step 3: Now, we need to subtract 73 from both sides of the equation to get the 'm' term by itself. 73*m + 73 - 73 = 0 - 73 73*m = -73 Step 4: Finally, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 73 to solve for 'm'. m = -73 / 73 m = -1 So, the solution to the equation 996*m + 73 = 923*m is m = -1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This clause states that only natural-born citizens of the United States are eligible to assume the office of the President. Since Schwarzenegger was born in Austria and later became a naturalized U.S. citizen, he does not meet this requirement.

Title: Toy Story 3 Movie plot: 17-year-old Andy[9] (John Morris) is about to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take only Woody (Tom Hanks) with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Jessie (Joan Cusack) and the other toys in a bag to be stored in the attic. Andy's mother (Laurie Metcalf) mistakenly takes the bag to the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy intended to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Barbie (Jodi Benson) bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake. Andy's toys are welcomed by the other toys at Sunnyside, and are given a tour of the seemingly idyllic play-setting by a bear named Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (\\"Lotso\\") (Ned Beatty), a baby named Big Baby, and a doll named Ken (Michael Keaton), with whom Barbie falls in love. The toys choose to stay, except Woody, who attempts to return to Andy, but is instead found by Bonnie Anderson (Emily Hahn), one of the Sunnyside students. She takes Woody home and plays with him along with her other toys, which are well-treated. Meanwhile, at Sunnyside, a group of toddlers play roughly with Andy's toys, unlike the gentler older children. Buzz seeks out Lotso to request to have them moved to the older children's room, but Lotso, who controls Sunnyside in a concentration camp-like style, refuses, explaining that the newer toys need to be sacrificed to the younger children to protect the older ones, who want to avoid enduring such damage and suffering. Seeing promise in Buzz, he resets him to his original space ranger persona, which also resets his memory. At the same time, Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris), through an eye she accidentally left in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for the toys and realizes Woody was telling the truth. However, before they can leave, Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's gang, guarded by Buzz. At Bonnie's house, a toy clown named Chuckles (Bud Luckey) explains to Woody that he, Lotso and Big Baby once had a beloved...

Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica. and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40.

The room DID look exactly like the one in the picture. Exactly, in fact. King sized bed (pretty comfy), flat screen tv, REALLY cheap and ugly pink/black furry.....thing and all. Didn't really appreciate the ghetto tagging etched into the window. But that was small and easy to ignore. And we really loved how centrally located the Flamingo is on the strip. The Paris and Caesar's are a short walk away (well, \\"short\\" in Vegas terms). We were enjoying our stay and the casino (did really well at Black Jack and the dealer - his name was T.G. - was alot of fun!!). Had breakfast at the Paradise Buffet on Sunday morning. You pay for the buffet up front and input your tip (kind of weird to tip before you've had your meal). I input 6.00 as the tip. The girl at the register mistakenly input 600.00!!! No problem, though, she caught the mistake herself and said she would fix it. Midway through our breakfast, she brought us a new receipt showing the corrections. Cool. Next morning, we want to check out. So we go to the handy dandy \\"Express Checkout\\" function on our TV. I've done this many times at many hotels. We go through the whole process only for the TV to tell us the \\"Express Checkout\\" is not working. Great. So we go to the Lobby and head for the Registration Desk. The line is huge. And, yes, there were only 3 people at the Registration Desk. Someone else here commented that they have WAAAY to few people working the desk for a property of this size.

We were pressed for time and couldn't afford to go to 6 different hotels to pick up more people (we took the shuttle from the airport to the Flamingo and stopped at 7 properties before they dropped us a block from the hotel entrance - they said it was due to construction but, it's funny, to pick people up, they pulled right up to the door). So, we told him no, thanks. We'll wait for a cab. He says, \\"Ok, gonna be awhile.\\" And walks away. 5 minutes later, the shuttle leaves the property.

Despite our eyes being tricked into perceiving depth and dimension, the objects they are viewing are, in fact, just traditional flat road marking. The contrast between what our eyes perceive and the reality is what creates this incredible illusion.

Write some highlights for the following article: Everton manager Roberto Martinez has followed the lead of his Merseyside rival Brendan Rodgers and told England manager Roy Hodgson to handle his star youngster Ross Barkley with care. Despite saying 20-year-old Barkley was ‘born to play football’ after his triumphant comeback against Aston Villa at Goodison Park on Saturday, Martinez is already laying down a marker ahead of next month when England face Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier and a hostile friendly in Scotland. Just as Rodgers has regularly warned against Raheem Sterling ‘burn-out’ and didn’t want him to play 180 minutes against San Marino and Estonia, Martinez is also advising caution with Barkley, who returned on Saturday for the first time since damaging knee ligaments in pre-season. Ross Barkley returned to the Everton starting line-up against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon. Everton manager Roberto Martinez (left) wants England boss Roy Hodgson (right) to take care over Barkley. The Spaniard knows that England coach Ray Lewington, who was at Goodison to watch, will have reported back to Hodgson with enthusiasm after Barkley played a part in Everton’s first two goals. ‘We need to be careful with Ross and Sterling,’ said Martinez. ‘Yes, England will want him in the next squad, but Ross still can’t play 90 minutes and we will have to see how long it takes for him to do that. ‘He’s been out for 14 weeks so we need to be careful. We have six games in three weeks (at Everton) so we need to give what the players needs. ‘With young players and England there needs to be a process to learn what is expected. Look at Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka, they took it to a different level when they got the knowledge. ‘It is understandable that the young players go through those experiences before they can win games for England.’ The problem for Martinez is he can’t avoid talking up the midfielder himself, hailing him as a rare talent who can combine technical and physical excellence. Barkley left the game to a standing ovation from the Everton fans at Goodison Park. Raheem Sterling (right) returned to the Liverpool starting line-up on Sunday in their 3-2 win at QPR. It was Barkley’s stinging shot which forced the corner from which Jagielka scored Everton’s opener against Aston Villa after 18 minutes. Barkley then fed Romelu Lukaku for the second goal after 48 minutes, though Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan will feel he should have done better. Seamus Coleman wrapped up the points after 76 minutes after Barkley had already left the field to a standing ovation from the Goodison Park crowd. ‘It’s hard to explain how Ross could come back with a performance like that. It should have been impossible for him to start against Villa, but he trains so hard, he’s just a natural,’ said Martinez. ‘He just loves playing football, and you see that and in a way he had to play.’ Manchester City, who are short of top-class homegrown players, would be prepared to pay big money to take him to The Etihad so perhaps it wasn’t particularly wise for Martinez to add: ‘The bigger the game, the more you get from him.’ But the comparison with another Merseyside street footballer, Wayne Rooney, was apt. ‘There are similarities 100 per cent. Sometimes we have to drag Ross away from training because at the end he’s in the two v two with the young kids, and he loves it. Phil Jagielka is congratulated by Barkley and Leighton Baines (left) after scoring the opener against Villa. Belgium international Romelu Lukaku was also among the scorers in Everton's 3-0 win against Aston Villa. ‘We take him away because he doesn’t see the energy it takes out of his body. He approaches the game in that manner and that’s his biggest strength.’ Everton started the weekend just outside the bottom three without a win in five games. But their performance on Saturday suggests they will start climbing rapidly from now onwards although their next challenge is a Europa League trip to Lille on Thursday.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who was appointed as chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London? ? In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,...

On the second day of talks here, the ministers also said that holders of Greek bonds would have to take much bigger losses than the 21 percent originally agreed to in July, though one bank official said that despite the ministers’ consensus, no agreement was near on write-offs that could reach as high as 60 percent. The ministers also reported that France and Germany had made progress on a third issue, how to increase the firepower of a rescue fund for the euro zone. Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, along with other European leaders, continued negotiating later Saturday. “I believe that now we have reached a more realistic view of the situation in Greece and that we will provide the necessary means to be able to protect the euro,” Mrs. Merkel said as she arrived at a gathering of European center-right leaders outside Brussels. The Sunday meeting would not bring final decisions, she said, adding that the leaders would take definitive steps at another scheduled meeting on Wednesday. Despite resistance from Spain and Italy, agreement seemed close on a plan worth around 100 billion euros, or 138 billion, to recapitalize European banks. The measure is intended to help banks better withstand turmoil in the markets. “We have laid down foundations for an agreement on the banking side,” said Anders Borg, Sweden’s finance minister. The talks on Saturday established an improved tone over the past week, when differences between Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy burst into the open. But the challenge remains for leaders to construct a comprehensive and credible package of measures by Wednesday’s meeting. Ministers were on track to ask bankers to write off around half of the value of their Greek bond holdings after a report by international lenders suggested that the economy in Greece had deteriorated so significantly that the 60 percent haircut was needed. “We have agreed yesterday that we have to have a significant increase in the banks’ contribution,” Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who is the head of the euro group of finance ministers, said on Saturday. He did not offer a specific figure. But Charles Dallara, the managing director of the Institute of International Finance, which has been negotiating on behalf of the banks, said the two sides were “nowhere near a deal,” The Associated Press reported. One remaining worry is that Greece shows few signs of returning to economic growth and, though he declined to say how much in losses banks would be willing to accept, Mr. Dallara added, “We would be open to an approach that involves additional efforts from everyone.” Greece’s deteriorating economic outlook was the subject of intense discussions among the ministers with Germany and the Netherlands pressing their case that private investors needed to take bigger losses. According to the international lenders’ report, a 60 percent loss for bondholders would be needed to bring Greece’s debt below 110 percent of gross domestic product by 2020. That represents a huge increase from the 21 percent losses private investors agreed to accept only three months ago. Without action, Greece’s financing needs could amount to roughly 252 billion euros through 2020, the document said, while under a worse outlook, the needs, including rollover of existing debt, could approach 450 billion euros. The emerging comprehensive package is highly complex and involves painstaking negotiations around issues that are often linked. For example, the deal to strengthen European banks is seen as vital to protect the banks from the fallout from write-downs on Greek bonds. The ministers agreed on Friday to release the majority of loans worth 8 billion euros to prevent Greece from defaulting. The International Monetary Fund could contribute about 2 billion euros to that fund. The biggest area of difference between France and Germany seemed to be narrowing after France appeared to be giving ground on how to bolster the euro rescue fund. Mrs. Merkel had firmly opposed the French suggestion that the fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, should get a banking license, which would enable it to borrow from the European Central Bank. France’s finance minister, François Baroin, said on Friday that the issue was “not a definitive point of discussion for us,” adding that “what matters is what works.” On Saturday, the Dutch finance minister, Jan Kees de Jager, said that use of the central bank was “no longer an option” but that two options were under consideration. Both options involve plans to insure against a portion of losses on Italian or Spanish bonds. Under one version this insurance would be offered by the bailout fund. The other would form an agency to buy bonds, perhaps attracting new investors like sovereign wealth funds. This would buy bonds on the primary and secondary markets using insurance offered by the bailout fund, said one official briefed on discussions but not authorized to speak publicly. One advantage of this plan might be that it could force clearer conditions for reform on countries whose bonds are bought.

Question: I really struggle to feel bad for people who actively choose to be miserable and manipulative. I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

The Court of Appeal ruled the officers can sue the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. They accused the Met of \\"letting them down badly\\" by not defending them against claims they beat Mr Ahmad. In March 2009 the Met paid Â£60,000 to Mr Ahmad after admitting he had been subjected to an attack. The Met initially denied Mr Ahmad's claim that he was punched, kicked and throttled during his December 2003 arrest. However, lawyers for the then commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson admitted at the High Court that Mr Ahmad had been the victim of \\"gratuitous and sustained violence\\" at his home in Tooting, south-west London. In 2011 the four officers - PCs Rod James-Bowen, Nigel Cowley, Mark Jones and Det Con John Donohue - were charged over the assault, but were later acquitted. Who is Babar Ahmad? Babar Ahmad was jailed in the US after setting up a website considered to be a key moment in the birth of the internet jihad. He was sentenced to 12-and-a-half years but fought an eight-year-long campaign against extradition. Mr Ahmad was released from a US prison in June last year and returned home after the authorities took into account his lengthy custody in the UK. The officers' initial claim for damages was rejected by the High Court. On appeal, judges ruled the four were entitled to bring their claim \\"for economic and reputational harm based on a breach of a duty of care at common law\\". The appeal judges said the officers were claiming the commissioner breached a duty of care when he admitted liability over Ahmad and made a public apology.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Some prescription medications can cause you to have increased prolactin levels. If you're on one of these medications, it could be the cause of your high prolactin levels. Dopamine, a brain chemical, blocks some secretion of prolactin. When you're on medications that block or lower your dopamine levels, your prolactin levels may rise. Some antipsychotics can cause this effect, such as risperidone, molindone, trifluoperazine, and haloperidol, and some antidepressants can, too. Metoclopramide, which is prescribed for severe nausea and acid reflux, may also increase the secretion of prolactin. A few medications that treat high blood pressure could also be the culprit, though it happens less frequently with these medications, which include reserpine, verapamil, and alpha-methyldopa. You don't want to go off a medication abruptly, especially one like an antipsychotic, which can have severe withdrawal effects. Therefore, if you want to get off one of these medications, discuss the issue with your doctor first. They may be able to switch you to another medication that doesn't have this effect. This medication has been shown to reduce prolactin levels when taken in place of other antipsychotics or when taken in addition to other antipsychotics. Ask your doctor if taking this medication is a possibility for you. Antipsychotics have the potential to raise prolactin since it inhibits the dopamine that causes prolactin to secrete from the pituitary gland. For long-term antipsychotic treatment, you may develop a tolerance so your prolactin levels return to normal, but they may stay above normal levels. This medication can cause side effects like dizziness, nervousness, headaches, stomach issues, weight gain, and pain in your joints. It can also make you feel unsteady on your feet.","completion":"This article discusses how certain prescription medications, including some antipsychotics, antidepressants, and medications for severe nausea, acid reflux, and high blood pressure, may lead to increased prolactin levels due to their effects on dopamine, and advises speaking with a doctor about alternative medication options and potential side effects before making any changes to one's treatment plan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The immediate cause involved the rights of Christian minorities in the Holy Land, which was a part of the Ottoman Empire. The French promoted the rights of Roman Catholics, while Russia promoted those of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The longer-term causes involved the decline of the Ottoman Empire and the unwillingness of Britain and France to allow Russia to gain territory and power at Ottoman expense.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What are McKinney and May continuing alone to complete? The film, narrated primarily by McKinney herself and supplemented by other interviews with primary characters and experts, is presented by animated headlines, newspaper photos, and brief televised news reports from the time of the case. McKinney details her upbringing as a charismatic young beauty queen with a self-reported IQ of 168. In search of a \\"clean-cut, all-American boy\\" for a potential husband, McKinney is introduced to Kirk Anderson, a young Mormon man on the eve of his religious mission. McKinney states that she and Anderson fell madly in love and that they were engaged to be married, but that she mistrusted the Mormon church and its hold over Anderson, declaring the church to be a \\"cult\\" that had \\"brainwashed\\" him. Former Mormon turned activist Troy Williams offers insight into Mormon practices, beliefs, and attitudes to explain how Mormonism might seem cult-like to one not raised in the religion. When Anderson was sent to England on his mission, McKinney, believing that the church elders deliberately separated them, recruited a pilot (Jackson Shaw, who appears in interviews) to fly her, her friend Keith \\"K.J.\\" May, and a hired bodyguard named Gil Parker to England on a \\"rescue mission\\" McKinney framed in terms of a romantic caper. Upon arriving in England, McKinney allegedly revealed items such as handcuffs, chloroform, and a fake handgun, causing Shaw and Parker to fear they might be participating in something illegal. Both men immediately returned to America, leaving McKinney and May to continue alone.

Title: Disappointing, I am afraid Review: I will never understand why some American authors have this need of constantly harping on the... the mythology of the story of their own country, I guess. I was quite enjoying the political setup of the story, when the Declaration of Independence started. I then realized that I was reading a sci-fi reworking of American history. Something similar to Orson Scott Card Book of Mormon-Earth saga. I would have enjoyed it anyway, but -in case someone had missed it- the authors launched in a word by word reiteration, going from tasteful recreation to lamentable rip-off. I am not American. I am not a mormon. I think such reworkings show a deep lack of respect for true history, specially because they tend to turn into maniquean expositions of Good vs. Bad.

In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. But I can use this background: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase. What is an answer for this question: Which test saw higher concentrations of the products, test C or test D? Answer:","completion":"Test C saw higher concentrations of the products. This is because the forward reaction was favored in test C, leading to an increase in the concentration of the products and a decrease in the concentration of the reactants. In contrast, test D favored the reverse reaction, resulting in a decrease in the concentration of the products and an increase in the concentration of the reactants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: 9Â½ Weeks Movie plot: The title of the film refers to the duration of a relationship between Wall Street arbitrageur John Gray and divorced SoHo art gallery employee Elizabeth McGraw. John initiates and controls the various experimental sexual practices of this volatile relationship to push Elizabeth's boundaries. In doing so, Elizabeth experiences a gradual downward spiral toward emotional breakdown. Elizabeth first sees John in New York City where she grocery shops and again at a street market where she decides against buying an expensive scarf. John wins her heart when he eventually produces that scarf. They start dating, and Elizabeth is increasingly subjected to John's behavioral peculiarities; he blindfolds Elizabeth, who is at first reluctant to comply with his sexual fantasy demands. Yet she sees him as loving and playful. He gives her an expensive gold watch, and instructs her to use it to think about him at noon. She takes this imperative even further by masturbating at her workplace at the designated time. However, he ultimately confuses Elizabeth by his reluctance to meet her friends despite the intimacy of their sexual relations. Elizabeth's confusion about John increases when he leaves her alone at his apartment. She examines his closet until she discovers a photograph of him with another woman. John asks her if she went through his stuff, declaring that he will punish her. Their ensuing altercation escalates into sexual assault until she blissfully concedes to his struggle to overpower her. Their sexual intensity grows as they start having sex in public places. Elizabeth's heightened need for psychosexual stimulation drives her to stalk John to his office and to obey his injunction to cross-dress herself for a rendezvous. On leaving the establishment, two men hurl a homophobic slur when they mistake John and Elizabeth for a gay couple. A fight ensues.

Context: Some legal scholars, such as John Baker of LSU, theorize that Madison's initial proposed language—that Congress should make no law regarding the establishment of a \\"national religion\\"—was rejected by the House, in favor of the more general \\"religion\\" in an effort to appease the Anti-Federalists. To both the Anti-Federalists and the Federalists, the very word \\"national\\" was a cause for alarm because of the experience under the British crown.

Question: Who does Sowell consider to be the main losers in affirmative action? Context: Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147 The answer is:","completion":"Thomas Sowell considers the main losers in affirmative action to be the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups, such as poor white or Asian individuals. He argues that affirmative action policies tend to primarily benefit the most fortunate among the preferred group, like upper and middle-class blacks, often to the detriment of those who are less fortunate in the non-preferred groups.

Process: - Blood is sent to the liver - The liver uses chemicals and proteins to treat the blood - The blood is cleaned - Energy is produced - The blood leaves the liver cleaned. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You go on a juice/water cleanse more often happens, how will it affect Your liver will be impacted by more toxins. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that going on a juice/water cleanse more often may introduce more toxins to the liver. To understand if this will have a direct or indirect effect on the blood processing in the liver, we need to consider whether the juice/water cleanse contains more harmful substances or fewer nutrients the liver needs to function properly. Step 2: Determine if the juice/water cleanse contains more toxins or fewer nutrients than the liver needs The contents of a juice/water cleanse can vary greatly depending on the ingredients used. Generally, juice cleanses provide a high amount of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants from fruits and vegetables. Water cleanses help increase hydration and potentially enhance detoxification processes. However, if the juice/water cleanse lacks balanced nutrients, such as protein and healthy fats, the liver might struggle to efficiently process the blood and produce energy. Furthermore, the presence of pesticides or other harmful substances in non-organic produce used in the cleanse might introduce more toxins for the liver to process. Step 3: Assess the effect of the supposed perturbation on the liver's blood processing process It is essential to establish whether the perturbation (going on a juice/water cleanse more often) will impact the liver's ability to process blood. If the liver receives more toxins or inadequate nutrients due to the juice/water cleanse, there could be several possible implications: 1. Direct impact: The liver's ability to clean the blood may be reduced or impaired due to the increased presence of toxins or lack of essential nutrients. This could result in the liver being less effective at purifying the blood. 2. Indirect impact: The lack of balanced nutrients may affect other organs or body systems, which can lead to additional stress being placed on the liver. For example, inadequate nutrient intake may weaken the immune system, causing the body to be more susceptible to infections. Consequently, the liver may need to work harder to filter out toxins and waste products from the blood. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of going on a juice/water cleanse more often could have both direct and indirect effects on the liver's blood processing process. The exact impact will depend on the specific juice/water cleanse and individual variations in users' physiology, but potentially, more toxins and inadequate nutrient intake could compromise the liver's ability to efficiently clean the blood and produce energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Michigan will lose 2 million in federal funding and 600,000 in state funding to provide legal aid to the poor in 2003, according to Deierdre L. Weir, executive director of the Legal Aid and Defender Association, Inc., the state's largest provider of legal services to the poor. Current federal funds of nearly 10.7 million from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) will drop to 8.7 million for next year, according to Weir. She said that the reductions reflect a decline in the number of persons in the state who are living in poverty, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 census. LSC uses census data to determine funding across the nation, and according to the census, the state's poverty population fell from an estimated 1.2 million in 1990 to an estimated 968,000 in 2000. The state's legal aid agencies are also bracing for yet another cut in 2003 of some 600,000 of state funding. A portion of filing fees paid by litigants in the state's circuit courts, and a portion of interest on lawyers trust accounts (IOLTA) are earmarked for Michigan legal aid programs. These funds are expected to drop from currently 7.5 million in 2002 to 6.9 million when the Michigan State Bar Foundation makes distributions next year. Most of the decrease is attributed to the past year's low interest rates. \\"The irony of these funding cuts is that while there may be fewer poor people in Michigan today, the demand for service will not change because the poverty population remains so large and the legal aid funding so little that local providers will never able to serve all who need our service,\\" said Weir. \\"It's as if the poor will be victimized twice-once for being poor and again as victims of these funding cuts.\\" The U.S. Census Bureau, in spite of its best efforts, cannot locate every poor person living in a census tract, therefore the poor are also undercounted, added Weir. The brunt of these cuts will be felt most in Wayne County where according to the census some 333,000 poor people live, the largest concentration of poverty in the state. LAD will lose more than 870,000 for legal aid in Wayne County, nearly half of the state's total loss, said Weir. While difficult to measure, the loss of funds will mean that several thousand of Michigan's poor in need of legal service will not receive it, or they will receive significantly limited service. Cutbacks will include service in such civil legal matters as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. \\"Local providers will have to work harder and smarter and use more technology instead of staff to provide as much service as we can with fewer dollars,\\" said Weir. \\"We will be providing more selfhelp training to clients enabling them to navigate the legal system on their own in routine matters, more assistance on the telephone, and less direct representation by attorneys in specific, high impact matters. Currently, Michigan has 13 legal aid agencies covering the state's 83 counties. Question: \\"What are the consequences of LAD funding cuts and who will be affected most?\\" Answer: \\"Will provide fewer servies & staff will be most affected\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer is not entirely correct. While it is true that there will be fewer services provided, the statement \\"staff will be most affected\\" does not capture the whole picture. The consequences of Legal Aid and Defender (LAD) funding cuts are expected to have a significant impact on the poor population in Michigan, particularly those who require legal aid services. Several thousands of Michigan's poor who are in need of legal services may not receive it, or they may receive significantly limited assistance. The provided answer fails to mention the specific services that may be reduced or limited, which include civil legal matters such as landlord-tenant, bankruptcy, consumer, child custody, predatory lending, mortgage foreclosure, utility shutoffs, social security, wills, and probate. Additionally, the answer does not mention that the most affected population will be the poor, especially those living in Wayne County, where the largest concentration of poverty in the state resides.

Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Giant pandas are now extremely rare. Their number is less than 1,000 in the wild. The hunting of pandas has been banned for many years, so this is not the problem. Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death. Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce. Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate. A newborn panda baby is born hairless and blind, is about 15cm long and weighs only 100g. The baby will stay with its mother for about 18 months, until it is able to set up its own territory Chinese and American scientists are studying giant pandas and their habits in order to put in place a major conservation programme. Zoos around the world are taking part in panda breeding programmes. There is still hope that with human's help, the giant panda can survive in the wild.

(CNN) -- When my airplane touched down in Birmingham, Alabama, I could not stop grinning. The trip last weekend fulfilled a lifelong dream to visit all 50 states. At age 31, I reached my goal. Alabama may not be at the top of many travel wish lists -- it wasn't on mine -- but its layered history offers many memorable experiences. I took an airport selfie right away, holding a map of the USA on which I proudly wrote, \\"I've been to ALL 50 states!\\" It's a map my dad pulled out of a phone book when I was a kid, penciling in the year we checked off each state. I've carried that simple map along on my travels, slowly filling it in. History is filled with a mixture of tragedy and triumph, and","completion":"Alabama is no exception. Stepping off the plane, I was eager to immerse myself in this unique Southern state's narrative. My first stop was Birmingham's Civil Rights District, where I visited important landmarks such as the 16th Street Baptist Church, the site of a racially motivated bombing that killed four young girls in 1963. This tragic event became a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement and helped bring national attention to the struggle for racial equality in the United States. Moving on from Birmingham, I headed south to Montgomery, the state's capital, which has played a significant role in the civil rights history. Here, I stood at the end of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where demonstrators were brutally attacked during the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. I was in awe of the courage and determination that defined these pivotal moments in American history. While exploring Alabama, I also discovered its rich cultural tapestry. From the vibrant live music scene in Muscle Shoals to the inspiring artwork at the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts, I was pleasantly surprised at every turn. Alabama's beautiful landscapes left me breathless, with the scenic vistas of the Appalachian Mountains in the north and the pristine white-sand beaches of the Gulf Coast in the south. In between my historical journey and cultural exploration, I indulged in the state's delicious local cuisine – from mouthwatering barbecue to decadent pecan pies. With each meal, I chatted with friendly locals who were happy to share their love for their home state. As my trip came to an end, I realized that Alabama, much like every other state, has its own unique charm and history that deserve to be appreciated. While it may not have initially been on my travel wish list, I'm grateful for the opportunity to have experienced such a multifaceted destination. The map that my dad pulled out of a phone book all those years ago was now complete, and I felt a deep sense of accomplishment and connection to each corner of our diverse nation. In conclusion, my journey to Alabama enlightened me on the significance of this state's layered history, deep-rooted culture, and remarkable beauty, solidifying that every state has something special to offer. My travels have taught me to approach each destination with an open mind and heart, embracing the unexpected joys that come with exploring new places."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to.

The Wagner tuba, as mentioned, is a modified member of the horn family. It is a brass instrument that has a unique sound somewhere between that of a trombone and the more traditional French horn. Richard Wagner specifically designed this instrument for his Ring cycle, and it has since been adopted by several composers, including Richard Strauss, for use in their own compositions. In Richard Strauss's works, the Wagner tuba can be heard in pieces such as his operas \\"Elektra\\" and \\"Die Frau ohne Schatten,\\" as well as in his \\"Alpine Symphony.\\" Furthermore, the Wagner tuba also appears in Béla Bartók's Eötvös Csongor et Tünde and has a significant role in Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 in E Major.

SINGAPORE — Envoys from the United States and North Korea are holding talks to iron out any last-minute differences before Tuesday's historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years. Whether such a deal can be done, Trump declared on Saturday, is something he will know almost... What is probably true about the outcome of the summit? - The Korean War will persist for another 70 years. - It will formally bring an end to a state of war on the Korean peninsula. - not enough information - If the summit goes poorly, U.S.-North Korean relations will decline. Answer:","completion":"Not enough information can be provided to predict the exact outcome of the summit. While the summit aimed to narrow the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over denuclearization, its results would depend on the negotiations and agreements between President Trump and Kim Jong Un. The summit could potentially pave the way for a peace treaty and formally end the state of war on the Korean peninsula, however, without more information, it's not possible to predict with certainty. If the summit were to go poorly, it could lead to a decline in U.S.-North Korean relationships, but the specific outcome would still be uncertain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By Michael Zennie PUBLISHED: 13:25 EST, 23 April 2013 | UPDATED: 09:51 EST, 24 April 2013 Charges have been dropped against a Mississippi man charged with sending ricin-laced poison letters to President Barack Obama, a U.S. senator and a state judge after his lawyer argued that he has been framed by a former friend. 'I've never heard of ricin or whatever. I thought they said rice. I told them I don't eat rice,' Kevin Curtis said at a press conference today, describing the moment he was questioned by federal authorities. Defense lawyer Christi McCoy said whoever framed her client was able to lead the FBI to his door simply by including Curtis' catch-phrase 'I'm KC and I approve this message' and a few other clues in the threatening notes that were mailed to Washington.","completion":"In a stunning turn of events, new evidence has come to light in the case of Mississippi resident Kevin Curtis, who was initially charged with sending ricin-laced poison letters to President Barack Obama, a U.S. senator, and a state judge. According to recent developments, it appears that Curtis may have been framed by a former friend, leading to the charges against him being dropped. At a press conference held today, Curtis was adamant in his defense, stating that he had never even heard of the dangerous toxin. \\"I've never heard of ricin or whatever. I thought they said rice. I told them I don't eat rice,\\" an incredulous Curtis told reporters. Curtis' defense lawyer, Christi McCoy, emphasized the seemingly orchestrated nature of the situation, saying that the real culprit had succeeded in implicating her client by incorporating Curtis' catchphrase, \\"I'm KC and I approve this message,\\" into the threatening notes sent to Washington. A few other clues pointing to Curtis were also included in the messages, leaving no doubt in McCoy's mind that her client had been framed. As the investigation continues, authorities have found new leads pointing to another individual who may be responsible for sending the ricin-laced letters. This person, who has not yet been named, is believed to be a former friend of Curtis and allegedly had a motive for framing him. The FBI has reportedly conducted searches at the new suspect's residence and is in the process of collecting evidence that could lead to charges being filed against this individual. The case of Kevin Curtis serves as a stark reminder of the potential for those accused of criminal activity to be innocent, despite what might initially appear as compelling evidence against them. The unfolding story has captured national attention and rattled the nation's capital, rekindling memories of dangerous deliveries in the past, such as the anthrax-laced letters following the September 11th attacks. As this case continues to develop and the FBI works toward apprehending the true perpetrator of this crime, vigilant citizens are once more reminded of the ever-present need for security and caution. With charges now dropped against Curtis, the focus turns toward vindication and getting to the bottom of this frightening ordeal. This news story serves as a cautionary tale for law enforcement and the public alike, that jumping to conclusions based on initial evidence may not always lead to the correct suspect, and that a thorough and fair investigation must always be given priority in the pursuit of justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

UPDATED:. 08:58 EST, 27 December 2013. Angry shoppers yesterday accused stores of ripping them off with bogus discounts as millions of people flocked to the Boxing Day sales. High street stores enjoyed record takings, with more than £3billion in total thought to have gone through the tills and footfall up on last year. But within hours, consumers vented their anger on Twitter after discovering some items were originally cheaper before the Boxing Day sales began. Angry shoppers yesterday accused stores of ripping them off with bogus discounts as millions of people flocked to the Boxing Day sales. Consumer groups warned shoppers to be on their guard against such ‘pseudo-sales’, in which prices are inflated just before they are discounted so that the deal looks better than it actually is. Yesterday there were concerns shoppers may have fallen victim to such tactics after furious messages appeared on Twitter from shoppers who claimed they had been ripped off. Chelsea Corcoran wrote: ‘The shoes I wanted are more expensive in the sale than they were originally, what??’ Eleanor Hampton wrote: ‘Confused how some trainers are now more expensive in the sale than before Xmas’. Helena Emmanuel added: ‘Went on the @ZARA website and a cardigan I saw two days ago in the shop is now more expensive on the sales page. B***** scam.’ High Street stores had record sales this Boxing Day though some shoppers feel they could have been duped into thinking items were cheaper than they ever had been. Meanwhile, Keith from Belfast took a photograph of an apparently dubious ‘sale’ item in the outdoor clothing store Trespass. A huge red sale label claimed the. men’s trousers were reduced from £76.99 to £38.49, while the original. tag showed the usual price was apparently just £34.99. He wrote: ‘Either @trespass don’t know how a sale works, or they’re trying to cheat people. Check the different prices.’ Meanwhile. City worker Colin Jäger, from Hampshire, wrote: ‘@Homebase_uk I’m not. impressed how you increased the prices of what I wanted to buy by 28%. just before your 20% sale.’ ‘It now costs more!!! ‘Disgraceful practice of putting up prices just before announcing your 20% sale – what a con!!’. A spokeswoman for Homebase said: 'Homebase has genuine offers and we fully adhere to the law surrounding pricing and promotion, taking into account pricing guidance. In doing this we work closely with Trading Standards. 'We update our pricing frequently to ensure that we offer customers the best deals in what is a highly complex and competitive trading environment.' Consumer group Which? has urged shoppers. to be vigilant of such tactics and warned them to ‘know their shopping. rights for the Boxing Day sales’. Thousands queued to be first through the doors at Selfridges in London on Boxing Day. Under Trading Standards rules, pre-sale prices should be the last price at which goods were offered –and the goods should have been at that price for 28 consecutive days in the previous six months. Which? has previously attacked supermarkets for pulling a similar stunt. Some stores were found to inflate prices for just a few days, before promoting their products as being half-price or better for weeks afterwards. The consumer group said chains were exploiting loopholes in fair-trading legislation to advertise offers on items such as fruit and wine ‘that might mislead you into thinking you are getting an extra-special bargain when you are not’. Yesterday Guy Anker, managing editor. of MoneySavingExpert.com urged customers to be careful when shopping in. the Boxing Day sales to ensure the discounts advertised were genuine. He. said: ‘We know that prices are being manipulated in some stores, which. is disingenuous. Shops put the price up a few days before they put the. goods in the sale, which dilutes the true value of the sale. It is easy. to get seduced by labels offering 50 per cent off or three for two. What. is more important is whether it is good value. Though record sales were taken, this year marked the first year there were more online shoppers than those on the High Street. ‘Just because it is in the sale it does not automatically mean you are getting the best price.’ Yesterday, retailers were celebrating bumper sales. Selfridges said online sales figures for Christmas Day were double last year’s, but in a sign that shoppers have not yet deserted the high street, 120,000 people visited its Oxford Street store yesterday. Manchester’s Trafford Centre said it believed it was the biggest Boxing Day sale in its history, while in London, 1.4million shoppers spent an estimated £50 million in the West End. Elsewhere, fights reportedly broke out between shoppers keen to snap up the best deals. Twitter user Kopsend wrote: ‘Punch-up in Next in Ipswich. People are going mad’, while Peter Foulkes said: ‘Next sale is manic – a woman started a fight with a guy over a £6 T-shirt’. Georgia Welsh wrote: ‘Fight in River Island sale because someone pushed in.’ Overwhelmed shoppers took to Twitter to describe fights breaking out in stores like River Island and Next. Many shoppers admitted snapping up the discounted designer goods so they could sell them online. Student Richie Ling, 21, who emerged from Harvey Nichols, in Leeds, said: ‘I have spent over £2,000 so far today. ‘I’ve bought three Gucci handbags and four Gucci wallets. Some of them will be gifts for my family, the rest I’ll be putting straight on eBay. ‘I got almost 50 per cent off some of the items so it could potentially be a good earner – the presents might even pay for themselves.’ None of the shops mentioned in the complaints were available for comment last night.

By Jaymi Mccann PUBLISHED: 08:05 EST, 7 February 2013 | UPDATED: 08:20 EST, 7 February 2013 An abandoned pig was found wandering the streets of Leicester after his owners dumped him for getting too big. Eight-month-old Percy, who was found by policemen out on patrol, was left malnourished and suffering from an infectious skin condition on New Year's Day. The piglet was taken in by stunned RSPCA staff who discovered that he refused to eat normal pig food and was malnourished after being fed sandwiches by his former owners. Eight-month-old Percy is now living in an RSPCA centre in Leicester. The staff there are attempting to nurse him back to health street before, it is unbelievably cruel, especially on","completion":"a day meant to bring in new beginnings and celebrations like New Year's Day. Abandoning any animal is heartless, but to leave a piglet like Percy, malnourished and suffering from an infectious skin condition, shows a complete lack of empathy and understanding on the part of his former owners. Pigs are intelligent, social animals, and such treatment would have caused untold emotional distress in addition to the physical suffering Percy had been subjected to. Moreover, feeding Percy sandwiches instead of proper pig food shows the previous owners' negligence towards providing proper nourishment and care. When RSPCA staff took Percy in, they were shocked to find that he refused to eat normal pig food, indicating that his previous diet had affected his eating habits, most likely causing further health problems. The result of such inadequate care was a weakened, and sick piglet who is now being given the love, attention, and care he so desperately needed. RSPCA staff in Leicester are now working tirelessly to help nurse Percy back to health. Under their care, Percy is slowly being introduced to proper pig food with a balanced diet to help him regain his strength and improve his overall well-being. In addition to addressing his malnourishment, the dedicated staff is also treating Percy's infectious skin condition with appropriate medication and care, ensuring that he has a smooth and painless recovery. During his time at the RSPCA centre, Percy has displayed an incredible resilience and eagerness to heal. With the support of his caretakers, the once abandoned piglet is slowly finding his way towards a happy and healthy life. He has shown a great capacity to trust and bond with the staff, despite the mistreatment he experienced at the hands of his former owners. It is sobering to think that Percy's ordeal could have been avoided if his original owners had considered the responsibility of raising a pig before deciding to keep him as a pet. Ensuring that you have the appropriate knowledge, resources, and dedication to care for an animal is vital for the well-being of both the owner and the pet. Percy's story serves as a stark reminder of the sad reality that many animals face each day—abandonment and mistreatment at the hands of those who are supposed to care for them. Despite the hardships Percy has faced, his tale is one of hope and resilience, as the RSPCA staff in Leicester demonstrate a true commitment to giving Percy the chance to live a long, healthy, and happy life. Once Percy has fully recovered, the RSPCA centre will make it their mission to find him a new, loving home where he can continue to thrive and grow. The hope is that Percy's story will also serve as a lesson to others about the importance of treating animals with empathy, respect, and compassion. Furthermore, this tale underscores the essential role that organizations like the RSPCA play in supporting animals in distress and providing them with the care and love they deserve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the version you might be referring to – which is famously known as \\"The Band\\" version – was not originally sung by Dylan himself. The song first gained prominence when it was recorded by The Band, a Canadian-American group that was initially named Levon and the Hawks. The Band's version of \\"I Shall Be Released\\" was featured on their debut album, \\"Music from Big Pink,\\" released in 1968. The Band was comprised of talented musicians, including Levon Helm, the only American member, along with Canadian members Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel, and Garth Hudson. All five contributed vocals throughout their career, creating a unique polyphonic vocal sound that was integral to the group's identity. On the track \\"I Shall Be Released,\\" Richard Manuel was the primary vocalist, with the other members providing background vocals and harmonies. Manuel's distinct, soulful voice brought its emotional quality to the song, helping it become one of The Band's most memorable and enduring recordings. Bob Dylan, who wrote the song, eventually recorded it himself and also included it on his 1971 album \\"Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II.\\" Since its initial release, \\"I Shall Be Released\\" has been covered by numerous artists across different genres, such as Joe Cocker, Nina Simone, The Heptones, and The Jerry Garcia Band, to name a few.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the album whose sales generate royalties used to benefit the charities Feeding America in the USA, Crisis in the UK, and the World Food Programme? from the following article ? Bob Dylan released his album Together Through Life on April 28, 2009. In a conversation with music journalist Bill Flanagan, published on Dylan's website, Dylan explained that the genesis of the record was when French film director Olivier Dahan asked him to supply a song for his new road movie, My Own Love Song; initially only intending to record a single track, \\"Life Is Hard,\\" \\"the record sort of took its own direction\\". Nine of the ten songs on the album are credited as co-written by Bob Dylan and Robert Hunter.The album received largely favorable reviews, although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work. Andy Gill wrote in The Independent that the record \\"features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as flit momentarily across his radar. So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks, it's one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you'll hear all year.\\"In its first week of release, the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., making Bob Dylan (67 years of age) the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart. It also reached number one on the UK album chart, 39 years after Dylan's previous UK album chart topper New Morning. This meant that Dylan currently holds the record for the longest gap between solo number one albums in the UK chart.On October 13, 2009, Dylan released a Christmas album, Christmas in the Heart, comprising such Christmas standards as \\"Little Drummer Boy\\", \\"Winter Wonderland\\" and \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\".

She begins to piece together a narrative about her mother's sexuality and sexual exploitation in a space ordered by gender and class difference, and is re-awakened to her persistent questioning about her father's identity.[4][5] As Alia negotiates her past, she also deals with her current relationship to her lover, Lotfi, who has asked her to have what seems to be yet another abortion.[4] [1] Her development throughout the film contrasts her awakening to a past of sexual and social servitude which many of the female servants experienced in the palace against her own contested independence fraught with pain, conflict and uncertainty.[1] My question: What is Khedija's occupation? A:","completion":"Khedija's occupation is a house servant and mistress in the prince's palace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Process: - Air is brought in through the mouth - Passes through the lungs - And into the bronchial tissue - The carbon dioxide is removed - The lungs bring the oxygen to the rest of the body. Question: suppose the person is dead happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"In the event of a person's death, there would be a significant impact on the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream, ultimately leading to less oxygen being delivered. To understand this, it is essential to analyze each step of the process, and how a person's death would influence these steps. 1. Air is brought in through the mouth: When a person is alive, the involuntary action of breathing allows air to enter the mouth and move to the lungs. In a deceased person, there is no muscular function; therefore, inhalation ceases, and no new air is brought into the body. 2. Air passes through the lungs: As mentioned above, without the muscle function to bring air into the lungs, no oxygen can be delivered to the lungs for exchange in a dead person. 3. Air passes into the bronchial tissue: In a functioning respiratory system, the air travels to the bronchial tissue, where the exchange of gases occurs. However, this relies on a living individual's ability to breathe. Without this critical function, air would not pass into the bronchial tissue in a deceased person. 4. Carbon dioxide is removed: In a living person's respiratory process, oxygen attaches to the hemoglobin in the blood and is carried to cells throughout the body, while carbon dioxide is removed and expelled. With the discontinuation of muscular function in a dead person, there is no exchange of gases in the lungs. Consequently, carbon dioxide is not removed, and the body's pH balance may become toxic as a result. 5. Oxygen is brought to the rest of the body: In an individual who is still alive, the heart continuously pumps blood throughout the body, thereby transporting oxygen and other essential nutrients to every cell. Once a person dies, their heart stops, and blood circulation ceases, preventing vital oxygen distribution. This inevitably leads to cellular damage and decay. To summarize, the death of a person has a tremendous impact on the delivery of oxygen to their bloodstream. Given the cessation of all bodily functions, including breathing, gas exchange, and circulation, the overall result would be significantly less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Therefore, the correct answer is B: less."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Charlie Hebdo: As ‘PEN Award 6′ withdraw, post-attack legacy is still being drawn THE LEGACY of the slain Charlie Hebdo cartoonists continues to find form and definition by the day. And it is ever looking as though their pen line will remain a longstanding dividing line: Should their collective cartoons aimed at Islam — sometimes by depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad — stand as a symbol of free speech, paid for in the highest price of human lives? Or are they a sign of irresponsibly hateful satire wielded with disproportionate venom, ultimately not in the name of a free press, but rather in the vein of pure and reckless provocation? This month, in the wake of Garry Trudeau’s George Polk career-award speech critical of Charlie Hebdo, I asked 15 top cartoonists about where their own satirical “red lines” stand since the Hebdo massacre. Now, we see that members of PEN are similarly divided. On May 5, Charlie Hebdo is due to receive the PEN American Center’s annual Freedom of Expression Courage award, as presented to Hebdo editor-in-chief Gerard Biard and staffer Jean-Baptiste Thoret in a Manhattan ceremony. But now, the “PEN Award 6,” if you will — novelists Peter Carey, Michael Ondaatje, Francine Prose, Teju Cole, Rachel Kushner and Taiye Selasi — are withdrawing from the event because of the Hebdo award, reports the New York Times. In withdrawing Friday, Kushner cited the French satirical weekly’s “cultural intolerance” and promotion of “a kind of forced secular view,” the Times reports — sentiments similar to those of the five other authors. And again, it bears repeating: Their words are not conflating Hebdo’s satirical practice with the horror and tragedy of January’s massacre at Hebdo’s Paris offices that left 12 dead, including five cartoonists. Judging by statements, this is not some broad-brush, “they had it coming” belief. (As Prose told the Associated Press, she “deplored” the killings, but can’t abide the honor’s implied “admiration and respect” for the Hebdo cartoons.) At issue, instead, is whether Charlie Hebdo is to be piously honored as a symbol of free speech. Carey is among those who essentially believe that Hebdo was “punching down” in its satire toward Islam. As he noted in a Times interview: “All this is complicated by PEN’s seeming blindness to the cultural arrogance of the French nation, which does not recognize its moral obligation to a large and disempowered segment of their population.” Vocally standing on the other side of this dividing line, however, is Salman Rushdie, he of the infamous fatwa over “The Satanic Verses.” Rushdie, a former PEN president, said his old friends Ondaatje and Carey are “horribly wrong,” stating: “If PEN as a free-speech organization can’t defend and celebrate people who have been murdered for drawing pictures, then frankly the organization is not worth the name.” (And it’s worth noting: The PEN leadership says membership has surged since the massacre.) [Would you run Charlie Hebdo’s Muhammad cartoons? Pew poll says: Depends on which of these demographic boxes you check] So now, amid this divide, we can expect organizations to examine more deeply than they might have what it means, exactly, to hand a plaque to surviving Hebdo staffers. Is an awarding group celebrating the magazine’s satiric philosophy — does a trophy tacitly applaud Hebdo’s content? Or does a statuette purely honor the principle of free speech as an absolute? And does such an award — as it did at January’s Angouleme comic-art festival — function largely as a memorial to lost lives. Yet again, event after vocal event, where will legacy-shaping influencers draw that demarcation: Will Charlie Hebdo mostly be upheld as a free-speech champion in the line of duty, or did the magazine’s satire toward Islamic targets, especially, cross a moral line? Or, perhaps, can both ideas, and outcomes, be held in our heads as independently true? In the heat of so many black-and-white arguments, after all, even some Charlie Hebdo artists paint with areas of gray. Garry Trudeau’s “Doonesbury” strip in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attack: Writer/artist/visual storyteller Michael Cavna is creator of the \\"Comic Riffs\\" column and graphic-novel reviewer for The Post's Book World. He relishes sharp-eyed satire in most any form. Summary:","completion":"Six authors, including Peter Carey and Michael Ondaatje, have withdrawn from the Pen America Center event on May 5, where Charlie Hebdo is due to receive the annual Freedom of Expression Courage award. The authors cited the French satirical weekly's \\"cultural intolerance\\" and promotion of \\"a kind of forced secular view\\" as their reasons for not participating. Salman Rushdie, former PEN president, has disagreed with the authors' withdrawal, stating that celebrating and defending those who have been murdered for drawing pictures aligns with PEN's role as a free-speech organization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What rank was the composer who composed a piece for the Paris Opera in the 1970s promoted to in 1987? Messiaen's next work was the large-scale La Transfiguration de Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ. The composition occupied him from 1965 to 1969 and the musicians employed include a 100-voice ten-part choir, seven solo instruments and large orchestra. Its fourteen movements are a meditation on the story of Christ's Transfiguration. Shortly after its completion, Messiaen received a commission from Alice Tully for a work to celebrate the U.S. bicentennial. He arranged a visit to the US in spring 1972, and was inspired by Bryce Canyon in Utah, where he observed the canyon's distinctive colours and birdsong. The twelve-movement orchestral piece Des canyons aux étoiles... was the result, first performed in 1974 in New York.In 1971, he was asked to compose a piece for the Paris Opéra. While reluctant to undertake such a major project, he was persuaded in 1975 to accept the commission and began work on his Saint-François d'Assise. The composition was intensive (he also wrote his own libretto) and occupied him from 1975 to 1979; the orchestration was carried out from 1979 until 1983. Messiaen preferred to describe the final work as a \\"spectacle\\" rather than an opera. It was first performed in 1983. Some commentators at the time thought that the opera would be his valediction (at times Messiaen himself believed so), but he continued to compose. In 1984 he published a major collection of organ pieces, Livre du Saint Sacrement; other works include birdsong pieces for solo piano, and works for piano with orchestra.In the summer of 1978, Messiaen retired from teaching at the Conservatoire. He was promoted to the highest rank of the Légion d'honneur, the Grand-Croix, in 1987. An operation prevented his participation in the celebration of his 70th birthday in 1978, but in 1988 tributes for Messiaen's 80th included a complete performance in London's Royal Festival Hall of St. François, which the composer attended, and Erato's publication of a seventeen-CD collection of Messiaen's music including a disc of the composer in...

Movie title: Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths Context: The movie begins in an alternate universe where Lex Luthor and a heroic analogue to the Joker named the Jester are stealing a device from Crime Syndicate headquarters. After securing the \\"Quantum Trigger,\\" Luthor and the Jester attempt to escape, but an alarm makes them realise the Syndicate are approaching. The Jester sacrifices himself with a bomb to allow Luthor a chance to get away, killing J'edd J'arkus (the Martian Manhunter's opposite) and Angelique (Hawkgirl's counterpart) who has just stabbed him with her flaming sword, in the process. Lex Luthor is confronted by the remaining Syndicate members, only to activate his dimensional travel device and escape to the Earth of the heroic Justice League, they are delayed thinking his device is a weapon. Once there, he turns himself over to the police, who he knows will think he's the evil Luthor from this world and thereby summon the Justice League. Superman's x-ray vision confirms Lex Luthor's reversed organs mean that he's from a parallel Earth, and that \\"their\\" Lex Luthor is still in the Stryker's Island prison, so the League agrees to hear Lex out. Lex tells his story and asks the League for help: his Earth is being extorted by the Syndicate, who have taken control of all of Earth and systematically eliminated Luthor's Justice League members. The only thing holding them in check is the threat of a nuclear response. While waiting outside the League's meeting room, he hides the Quantum Trigger. All members of the League agree, except for Batman, who argues that the League is spread too thin for the problems of their own world, let alone Luthor's. Luthor transports the remaining members of the League to his universe, while Batman stays behind to finish building the Watchtower. Arriving at Justice League headquarters on Lex's parallel Earth, they find the Syndicate and must soon retreat. Regrouping at Jester's base, they make plans to attack Syndicate targets, and they even capture Ultraman, the villainous counterpart to Superman. However, United States...","completion":"President Slade Wilson, who is aware of the existence of the Crime Syndicate, frees Ultraman to maintain the balance of power. The Justice League is disappointed by this turn of events but remains undeterred in their mission. They split up to target multiple Syndicate bases, obtain the Quantum Trigger, and attempt to find a way to dismantle the Syndicate's stranglehold on this Earth. Wonder Woman and Firestorm take on Superwoman and find out that her alternate universe counterpart is, in fact, the superhero Wonder Woman's twin sister, Donna Troy. The Flash and Green Lantern face off against Johnny Quick, who is the Crime Syndicate's evil version of the Flash. Meanwhile, Martian Manhunter confronts and defeats the Martian Manhunter's evil counterpart, J'edd J'arkus, who had actually survived the bomb explosion. The Justice League eventually learns that Owlman, the evil counterpart of Batman, has secretly been controlling the Crime Syndicate and planning to use the inter-dimensional device to destroy Earth Prime, the original and central Earth from which all other alternate Earths diverged. His twisted reasoning is that since there are infinite Earths in which every possibility exists, nothing truly matters, and destroying Earth Prime will erase all life across the multiverse. Back in the Justice League's home universe, Batman completes the Watchtower but realizes the potential danger that Owlman poses. He uses Lex Luthor's inter-dimensional transport device to join the other League members in the alternate universe. Batman and the Justice League then confront Owlman, who has transported himself and the weapon to Earth Prime. Batman pursues Owlman to Earth Prime and defeats him, preventing him from detonating the Quantum Trigger and ending all existence across the multiverse. In the end, the Justice League returns to their Earth, having saved countless alternate Earths, including Lex Luthor's. However, Owlman's motivations and actions serve as a stark reminder of the delicate balance and responsibility that comes with great power and the fight for justice. The League gains a deeper understanding of their role as protectors and the potential for darkness even in alternate versions of themselves. In conclusion, in the movie 'Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths', the League battles the Crime Syndicate, evil counterparts from a parallel Earth controlled by them. This conflict forces the Justice League to confront the darker aspects of their own powers, serves as a lesson in responsibility and the need for balance, and ultimately strengthens their resolve to protect justice across the multiverse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One morning, Jan was in a lift of a high building with his window cleaning tools when the building was on fire. There were five other passengers in the lift. All of a sudden the lift stopped. Although they didn't know what had happened outside, they had only 100 minutes to get out of the building before it would fall into the dust. Soon smoke began coming into the lift. The men knew that something was wrong. They tried to open the door but found a wall in front of them. The wall had the number 15 on it and they knew they were on the 15th floor. But their lift usually didn't stop there, so there was no opening for them to escape. Jan decided they would have to make their own. Knowing that the wall was made of a material that could be cut through, Jan took out his window cleaning tools, and began knocking a hole through the wall. When he felt tired, others helped. Starting with one small hole, they cut through the three-inch-thick wall. Then they kicked hard at the wall. The wall cracked apart. They saw before them a tile wall! Refusing to give up, they knocked a hole through the tile, then made the opening big enough to get through.

Which entity is this text about? Toru Takemitsu (Wu Man Che , Takemitsu Toru, October 8, 1930 - February 20, 1996) pronounced [takemitsW to:rW] was a Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory. Largely self-taught, Takemitsu possessed consummate skill in the subtle manipulation of instrumental and orchestral timbre. He is famed for combining elements of oriental and occidental philosophy to create a sound uniquely his own, and for fusing opposites together such as sound with silence and tradition with innovation. He composed several hundred independent works of music, scored more than ninety films and published twenty books. In 1948, Takemitsu conceived the idea of electronic music technology, or in his own words, to \\"bring noise into tempered musical tones inside a busy small tube.\\" During the 1950s, Takemitsu had learned that in 1948 \\"a French [engineer] Pierre Schaeffer invented the method(s) of musique concrete based on the same idea as mine. I was pleased with this coincidence.\\" In 1951, Takemitsu was a founding member of the anti-academic Jikken Kobo (Shi Yan Gong Fang , \\"experimental workshop\\"): an artistic group established for multidisciplinary collaboration on mixed-media projects, who sought to avoid Japanese artistic tradition. The performances and works undertaken by the group introduced several contemporary Western composers to Japanese audiences. During this period he wrote Saegirarenai Kyusoku I (\\"Uninterrupted Rest I\\", 1952: a piano work, without a regular rhythmic pulse or barlines); and by 1955 Takemitsu had begun to use electronic tape-recording techniques in such works as Relief Statique (1955) and Vocalism A*I (1956). Takemitsu also studied in the early 1950s with the composer Fumio Hayasaka, perhaps best known for the scores he wrote for films by Kenji Mizoguchi and Akira Kurosawa, the latter of whom Takemitsu would collaborate with decades later. In the late 1950s chance brought Takemitsu international attention: his Requiem for string orchestra (1957 listen ), written as an homage to Hayasaka, was heard by Igor Stravinsky in 1958 during his visit to Japan. (The NHK had organised opportunities for Stravinsky to listen to some of the latest Japanese music; when Takemitsu's work was put on by mistake, Stravinsky insisted on hearing it to the end.) At a press conference later, Stravinsky expressed his admiration for the work, praising its \\"sincerity\\" and \\"passionate\\" writing. Stravinsky subsequently invited Takemitsu to lunch; and for Takemitsu this was an \\"unforgettable\\" experience. After Stravinsky returned to the U.S., Takemitsu soon received a commission for a new work from the Koussevitsky Foundation which, he assumed, had come as a suggestion from Stravinsky to Aaron Copland. For this he composed Dorian Horizon, (1966), which was premiered by the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Copland.","completion":"This text is about Toru Takemitsu, a renowned Japanese composer and writer on aesthetics and music theory who was born on October 8, 1930, and passed away on February 20, 1996.

As a part number is an identifier of a part design (independent of its instantiations), a serial number is a unique identifier of a particular instantiation of that part design. In other words, a part number identifies any particular (physical) part as being made to that one unique design; a serial number, when used, identifies a particular (physical) part (one physical instance), as differentiated from the next unit that was stamped, machined, or extruded right after it. This distinction is not always clear, as natural language blurs it by typically referring to both part designs, and particular instantiations of those designs, by the same word, \`\`part(s)''. Thus if you buy a muffler of P/N 12345 today, and another muffler of P/N 12345 next Tuesday, you have bought \`\`two copies of the same part'', or \`\`two parts'', depending on the sense implied. Is it true that is part number the same as serial number?","completion":"No, a part number and a serial number are not the same. While they may seem similar, they both serve different purposes in identifying and differentiating parts. A part number is an identifier for a specific part design. It represents the unique design, specifications, and features of a particular part. All instances (physical units) of a part with the same part number will have the same design and specifications, making it easier for manufacturers, suppliers, and customers to identify, order, and replace it when needed. Essentially, the part number is like a blueprint that ensures consistency in manufacturing and maintenance processes regardless of when or where the part was produced. On the other hand, a serial number is a unique identifier assigned to a single instantiation (physical unit) of a part made from the same design. Serial numbers differentiate between individual units of a part, allowing for effective tracking, quality control, and traceability throughout the part's life. For example, if there is a defect or recall on a specific batch of parts, the serial number helps pinpoint the exact units affected, making it easier for manufacturers to address the issue. In summary, while both part numbers and serial numbers are used to identify parts, a part number is used to identify and describe the design of a part, while a serial number differentiates between individual units of that part. Consequently, part numbers ensure consistency in design and specifications, while serial numbers support traceability, tracking, and quality control at the unit level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[ii] This proves girls tell the truth all the time.","completion":"[i] She ended up being very poor. It's unfortunate to hear that your experience with this girl was negative. It's essential to recognize that people can sometimes be deceptive or lie, regardless of their gender. While it is true that some girls may say things they do not mean, we must also consider that this is a trait found among people in general. Miscommunication can be a common issue in relationships or friendships, and it's crucial to develop trust and understanding to overcome these obstacles. When someone tells you something that turns out not to be true, it can be a hurtful experience. However, it's equally important not to generalize negative experiences with one person to the entire gender. In your specific situation, when the girl you were talking to lied about being rich, it may have been essential to consider her motives for doing so. People may lie for various reasons, including insecurity, seeking attention, or even to protect themselves. It is essential to approach these situations with compassion, empathy, and a willingness to understand the underlying reasons. As for your provided options, the natural next sentence, in this case, would be \\"[i] She ended up being very poor.\\" This statement concludes the previously mentioned fact and provides context to the lie you experienced.

Write a summary based on this article: Researchers have uncovered animal bones, flint tools, and evidence of burning that predates the first stones at Stonehenge by nearly 5,000 years. Here, an animal bone, with a point still in it Editor's Note: This story was updated April 24 at 10:20 a.m. ET. A site near Stonehenge has revealed archaeological evidence that hunters lived just a mile from Stonehenge roughly 5,000 years prior to the construction of the first stones, new research suggests. What's more, the site, which was occupied continuously for 3,000 years, had evidence of burning, thousands of flint tool fragments and bones of wild aurochs , a type of extinct giant cow. That suggests the area near Stonehenge may have been an auroch migration route that became an ancient feasting site, drawing people together from across different cultures in the region, wrote lead researcher David Jacques of the Open University in the United Kingdom, in an email. \\"We may have found the cradle of Stonehenge, the reason why it is where it is,\\" Jacques wrote. [In Photos: A Walk Through Stonehenge] The new discovery may also identify the people who first erected structures at Stonehenge. A few gigantic pine posts, possibly totem poles, were raised at Stonehenge between 8,500 and 10,000 years ago, but until now there was scant evidence of occupation in the area that long ago. The new research suggests those ancient structures may perhaps have been raised to honor a sacred hunting ground. Mysterious monument For decades, people have wondered at the enigmatic stone structures erected roughly 5,000 years ago in the plains of Wiltshire, England. No one knows why ancient people built the structure: some believe it was a place of ancient worship or a sun calendar, whereas still others think it was a symbol of unity or even that Stonehenge was inspired by a sound illusion. The large megaliths, known as sarsens, are up to 30 feet tall and weigh up to 25 tons, while the smaller bluestones weigh up to 4 tons. Researchers think the giant boulders came from a quarry near Marlborough Downs, just 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the iconic site, while the bluestones likely came from Preseli Hills in Wales, nearly 156 miles (250 km) away from Stonehenge. Old photographs Jacques was looking through archival photographs of the region surrounding Stonehenge when he spotted a site known as Vespasian's Camp, just a mile from Stonehenge in nearby Amesbury. Realizing that it hadn't been fully surveyed, Jacques began to investigate the area, which harbored a freshwater spring. Because animals like to stop and drink at such watering holes, Jacques wondered whether ancient man may have settled nearby as well. The team uncovered roughly 350 animal bones and 12,500 flint tools or fragments, as well as lots of evidence of burning. Carbon dating suggested the area was occupied by humans from 7500 B.C. to 4700 B.C. — roughly 5,000 years prior to the erection of the first stones at Stonehenge. [See Photos of the Stonehenge Hunting Ground ] \\"The spring may have originally attracted large animals to it, which would have aided hunting and may have led to associations that the area was a sacred hunting ground,\\" Jacques wrote. In addition, the researchers found tools made from stone from one region of England, but fashioned in the style of another region (for instance, a stone tool made from Welsh or Cornwall slate, but made in a style typical of Sussex). That suggests the people from different regions were coming together at the site, Jacques wrote. Ancient builders? The findings could help researchers pinpoint why the ancient builders of Stonehenge chose the place they did, Jacques said. \\"We have found a bridge from which transmission of cultural memory about the 'specialness' of the place where the stones were later being put up was possible,\\" Jacques wrote. \\"We are getting closer to understanding their reasons for putting it up — it is all to do with ancestors, but those ancestors go much further back than has previously been realised.\\" The findings show \\"there was a substantial interest in the Stonehenge landscape well before the stones were hauled there and erected,\\" said Timothy Darvill, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University in the U.K., who was not involved in the study. Excavations dating to 2008 at Stonehenge also confirm earlier use at the megalithic site, Darvill wrote. However, what makes the Amesbury discovery special is the large trove of auroch bones found in the area, which suggests the spring was on a natural migration route for the wild aurochs, he said.

This marks a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to prosecute those responsible for aiding and encouraging terrorism and radicalization. This article delves into the background of the recruiter, details of the case, and the broader implications for counterterrorism efforts. Background of the ISIS Recruiter The recruiter in question, whose identity remains undisclosed for security reasons, is believed to have played a pivotal role in the Islamic State's recruitment network across Europe, particularly in enticing and facilitating the journey of British nationals to Syria. This individual operated both online and in person, exploiting social media platforms as well as direct contact to radicalize vulnerable, disillusioned individuals. According to investigations, the recruiter sympathized with the extremist ideologies espoused by the Islamic State, sharing the group's toxic narrative and vision of a so-called caliphate. By instilling loyalty to this cause, the recruiter was able to strengthen his network, seeking out individuals susceptible to such extremist rhetoric. Details of the Case The recent court hearing revealed the recruiter's involvement in the attempted journeys of two British citizens who were caught attempting to travel to Syria. Evidence gathered by authorities exposed that the recruiter had provided the would-be jihadis with logistical support, navigational advice, and connections to other operatives to ensure their safe passage. Additionally, it was found that the recruiter had helped these individuals acquire necessary, yet falsified, documentation to travel. The British Security Forces' quick and seamless coordination to detain these individuals highlighted the effectiveness of cooperation between intelligence agencies and the criminal justice system in ensuring the swift apprehension of those affiliated with terror cells. This symbiotic relationship is essential to identifying and disrupting potential threats before they can materialize. Implications for Counterterrorism Efforts This conviction sends a strong message to those who consider supporting terrorism or acting upon extremist ideologies that they will be held accountable for their actions. By prosecuting individuals like this recruiter, the United Kingdom demonstrates its hope to deter potential offenders and reinforce the harsh consequences of engaging in terrorist activities. Furthermore, the case reflects the necessity for a multifaceted approach to counterterrorism. This involves understanding the appeal and recruitment strategies of terrorist organizations like the Islamic State, while continually adapting and enhancing tactics designed to prevent radicalization and the proliferation of violent extremism. Closing Thoughts The conviction of the ISIS recruiter marks a significant stepping stone in the unrelenting battle against terrorism and radicalization. This outcome emphasizes that the British Justice System will not tolerate individuals who seek to undermine the security and stability of its citizens through the proliferation of toxic, violent ideologies. Ultimately, the pursuit of justice in cases like these remains critical to safeguard our society from the threat of terrorism, undoubtedly enhancing the safety and well-being of future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the purpose: Determine the specific purpose for which the item needs to be sweetened. Is it for a dessert, a beverage, or enhancing the taste of a savory dish? Understanding the purpose helps to choose the appropriate sweetening alternative. 2. Consider options: Based on the purpose, think of various alternatives to honey that are suitable for sweetening. Some common options include sugar (white, brown, or powdered), maple syrup, agave nectar, stevia, artificial sweeteners (like sucralose, aspartame, or saccharin), molasses, or fruit-based sweeteners (like applesauce, mashed bananas, or dates). 3. Assess taste preferences and dietary restrictions: Consider the taste preferences of those who will consume the sweetened item, as well as any possible dietary restrictions or allergies (e.g., vegan, diabetic, or low-calorie). This could affect the choice of sweeteners to be used. 4. Quantity and sweetness ratio: Determine the appropriate quantity of the chosen sweetener to add to your dish or beverage. Take into account that different sweeteners have different sweetness levels in comparison to honey, so it's important to adjust the amount accordingly to achieve the desired sweetness. 5. Application: Add the chosen sweetener to the item you want to sweeten by either dissolving it in a liquid (such as a beverage or sauce) or incorporating it into a solid mixture (such as dough or batter). Be sure to mix it well to ensure that the sweetness is evenly distributed throughout the item. 6. Taste and adjust: Once the sweetener has been added, taste the item to check the sweetness level. If needed, adjust the sweetness by adding more of the chosen sweetener or a different one until the desired taste is achieved. 7. Serve and enjoy: Once the item has been sweetened to taste, it's ready to be served and enjoyed. By following these steps, you can successfully sweeten something without using honey, while still maintaining a delicious, satisfying taste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: (Reuters) - Omar Abdel-Rahman, the Muslim cleric known as “the blind sheikh” who was convicted of conspiracy in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and of planning a broader “war of urban terrorism” in the United States, died on Saturday in a North Carolina prison, authorities said. Abdel-Rahman, 78, died of natural causes at 9:40 a.m. (1440 GMT) at a medical center at a federal prison compound in Butner, North Carolina, according to Greg Norton, a spokesman. The cleric, who had diabetes and coronary artery disease, had been incarcerated at the complex for nearly 10 years, Norton said. Earlier, the cleric’s son Ammar said his family had received a phone call in Eygpt from a U.S. representative saying his father had died. The Egyptian-born Abdel-Rahman remained a spiritual leader for radical Muslims even after more than 20 years in prison. With his long gray beard, sunglasses and red and white clerical cap, the charismatic Abdel-Rahman was the face of radical Islam in the 1980s and 1990s. He preached a fiery brand of Islam that called for the death of people and governments he disapproved of and the installation of an Islamic government in Egypt. His following was tied to fundamentalist killings and bomb attacks around the world. “Abdel-Rahman was at the vortex of some of the bloodiest and most consequential terrorist incidents of the 1990s - incidents that would establish the patterns of global terrorism that continue to bedevil us today,” said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University in Washington. “He was a tireless and enthusiastic in projecting his message of violence and hatred,” said Hoffman, who served on the U.S. government’s commission that reviewed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington and over Pennsylvania. Abdel-Rahman, who was born in a village along the Nile on May 3, 1938, lost his eyesight due to childhood diabetes and grew up studying a Braille version of the Koran. As an adult he became associated with the fundamentalist Islamic Group and was imprisoned and accused of issuing a fatwa leading to the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, against whom he had railed for years. The sheikh said he was hung upside-down from the ceiling, beaten with sticks and given electric shocks while held but he was eventually acquitted and went into self-imposed exile in 1990. He managed to get to New York after the U.S. Embassy in Sudan granted him a tourist visa in 1990 - despite the fact that he was on the State Department’s list of people with ties to terror groups. U.S. authorities blamed a computer error for the visa, but the mistake was compounded in 1991 when Abdel-Rahman was given a green card and permanent U.S. resident status. The New York Times reported the CIA had approved the visa application for Abdel-Rahman, who had supported the anti-Soviet mujahedin in Afghanistan during the 1980s. Abdel-Rahman preached his radical message and lived in the New York City borough of Brooklyn and nearby Jersey City, New Jersey, building a strong following among fundamentalist Muslims. Even in exile, he remained a force in the Middle East, where followers listened to cassette tapes and radio broadcasts of his sermons decrying the Egyptian government and Israel. While in the United States Abdel-Rahman and his disciples would be linked to the 1990 slaying in New York of militant Rabbi Meir Kahane, the 1992 killing of an anti-fundamentalist writer in Egypt and attacks on foreign tourists in Egypt. U.S. authorities took action in 1992 by revoking Abdel-Rahman’s green card on the grounds that he had lied about a bad check charge in Egypt and about having two wives when he entered the country. He was facing the possibility of deportation when a truck bomb went off in the basement parking garage of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000 in an attack that made Americans realize that they were not immune to international terrorism. Four months later Abdel-Rahman was arrested and went on trial with several followers in 1995, accused of plotting a day of terror for the United States - assassinations and synchronized bombings of the U.N. headquarters, a major federal government facility in Manhattan and tunnels and a bridge linking New York City and New Jersey. The indictment said Abdel-Rahman and his followers planned to “levy a war of urban terrorism against the United States” as part of a jihad - or holy war - to stop U.S. support for Israel and change its overall Middle East policy. The defendants were not directly charged with the 1993 World Trade Center attack but were convicted of conspiring with those who did carry out the bombing. Abdel-Rahman’s convictions also included plotting to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a visit to the United States in 1993, a Jewish New York state legislator and a Jewish New York State Supreme Court justice. Much of the case against Abdel-Rahman and his followers was based on video and audio recordings made with the help of a bodyguard for the sheikh who became an FBI informant. A video also showed four defendants mixing fertilizer and diesel fuel for bombs. After a nine-month trial, the sheikh and nine followers were found guilty in October 1995 on 48 of 50 charges. He did not testify at his trial but at a sentencing hearing Abdel-Rahman gave a passionate speech of more than 90 minutes through a translator, proclaiming his innocence and denouncing the United States as an enemy of his faith. Egyptian Omar Abdel-Rahman speaks during a news conference in this still image taken from February 1993 video footage on January 18, 2013. REUTERS/Reuters TV/Files “I have not committed any crime except telling people about Islam,” he said. Abdel-Rahman was still an important figure in radical Islam even after years in prison. A year before his al Qaeda followers pulled off the most destructive assault on U.S. soil, the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Osama bin Laden had pledged a jihad to free Abdel-Rahman from prison. When Mohammed Mursi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, began his short-lived presidency of Egypt in 2012, he said winning the sheikh’s freedom would be a priority and the jihadists who attacked an Algerian oilfield and took hostages in 2013 also demanded his release. In 2006 one of Abdel-Rahman’s lawyers, Lynne F. Stewart, was sentenced to 28 months in prison for helping smuggle messages from the cleric to his followers in Egypt. ||||| FILE - This April 6, 1993 file photo shows Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman in New York.

(AP) — Omar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik convicted of plotting terror attacks in the United States in the 1990s, has died. He was 78. Kenneth McKoy of the Federal Correction Complex in Butner, North Carolina, said Rahman died at 5:40 a.m. after suffering from diabetes and coronary artery disease. Abdul-Rahman had been at the complex for seven years. Rahman was a key spiritual leader for a generation of Islamic militants and became a symbol for radicals during a decade in American prisons. Abdel-Rahman, blind since infancy from diabetes, was the leader of one of Egypt's most feared militant groups, the Gamaa Islamiya, which led a campaign of violence aimed at bringing down ex-President Hosni Mubarak. Abdel-Rahman fled Egypt to the U.S. in 1990 and began teaching in a New Jersey mosque. A circle of his followers were convicted in the Feb. 26, 1993 truck bombing of New York's World Trade Center that killed six people — eight years before al-Qaida's suicide plane hijackers brought the towers down. Later in 1993, Abdel-Rahman was arrested for conspiracy to carry out a string of bombings against the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland tunnels, the George Washington Bridge and other New York landmarks. |||||Summary:","completion":"Omar Abdel-Rahman, the Muslim cleric known as \\"the blind sheikh\\" who was convicted of conspiracy in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and of planning a broader \\"war of urban terrorism\\" in the United States, died aged 78 on 18 February in a North Carolina prison due to natural causes.

Paragraph: Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania, founded by King Zog in 1938. RTSH runs three analogue television stations as TVSH Televizioni Shqiptar, four digital thematic stations as RTSH, and three radio stations using the name Radio Tirana. In addition, 4 regional radio stations serve in the four extremities of Albania. The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via medium wave (AM) and short wave (SW).

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: make crisp french fries","completion":"To determine the best solution for making crisp French fries, I will compare two popular methods: deep frying and baking. I will consider factors such as taste, texture, and ease of preparation. Deep Frying: 1. Peel and cut the potatoes into even-sized fries. 2. Soak the fries in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch, which helps achieve a crispy texture. 3. Drain the water and pat the fries dry with a paper towel. Removing excess water prevents splattering during frying. 4. Preheat the oil to 325°F (163°C) in a deep fryer or a deep, heavy pot. 5. Fry the fries in small batches to avoid crowding and ensure even cooking, lightly browning them for 5-6 minutes. 6. Remove the fries with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Allow them to cool for a few minutes. 7. Increase the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C). Refry the fries for a second time until they are crisp and golden brown, around 2-3 minutes. 8. Remove from oil, drain on paper towels, and season with salt. Baking: 1. Preheat the oven to 450°F (232°C) and position racks in the middle and upper third of the oven. 2. Peel and cut the potatoes into even-sized fries. 3. Soak the fries in cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove excess starch. 4. Drain the water and pat the fries dry with a paper towel. 5. Toss the fries in a bowl with a small amount of oil and seasoning. 6. Spread the fries on two baking sheets in a single layer, ensuring they are not touching to promote even cooking. 7. Bake for 25-30 minutes, turning the fries and rotating the sheets halfway through, until the fries are golden brown and crisp. Conclusion: While both methods have their merits, deep frying is better for achieving consistently crisp French fries. The process of double frying at different temperatures ensures a crispy exterior and a tender interior while also providing the distinct flavor and texture associated with restaurant-quality fries. Baking can yield satisfactory results, but it may require more effort to achieve a consistently crispy texture throughout the entire batch. Additionally, baking does not provide the same level of the satisfying crunch commonly associated with deep-fried French fries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After helping Devereux push his car to the garage, the young woman again refuses to explain how she knows him or tell him her name. While waiting, the woman suggests they go to a motel nearby, apparently for sex. After checking into a room, and getting ready in the bathroom, Devereux exits and discovers that she is gone, leaving behind a message written on a mirror in red lipstick which says that the time is not yet right.Having collected his repaired vehicle, Devereux encounters a hearse driving on the road ahead.

Skeleton muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs when sarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past each other, which is called the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. ATP provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and filament sliding. Regulatory proteins, such as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. Excitation–contraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. The number of muscle fibers contracting determines how much force the whole muscle produces. Q: The body contains how many types of muscle tissue?

Cabinets provide an ideal solution for concealing electronic devices like televisions when not in use, especially if you want to create a streamlined and clutter-free look in your living space. Cabinets come in a variety of sizes, styles, and materials, offering many possibilities to suit your personal taste and the decor of your home. You can choose a cabinet that complements your existing furniture and matches the overall design theme of your room. There are many types of cabinets specifically designed to store and hide televisions, such as TV lift cabinets or TV armoire cabinets. TV lift cabinets are equipped with a motorized mechanism that lifts the television into view when in use and lowers the TV back into the cabinet when not in use. TV armoire cabinets feature doors that can be opened to reveal the television and closed to hide it when not in use. Apart from these specialized cabinets, you can also use a regular cabinet to store your television. Depending on the size and design of the cabinet, you can either mount the TV on the wall inside the cabinet or place the TV on a shelf. When the doors are closed, the television will be concealed from view. This approach allows for more flexibility in terms of positioning the cabinet in your preferred room and reusing the cabinet for other purposes if needed. In summary, a cabinet is the most suitable option for storing and hiding a television. It not only offers practical storage solutions but also allows you to maintain the aesthetic appeal of your living space. By selecting a cabinet that complements your home's design, you can create a harmonious visual effect while keeping your television concealed and ensuring a neat and organized look."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: Bradley should not have said anything about Gore's campaign-finance practices. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis can be analyzed through the logical connections between the statements. In order to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, one needs to understand the implications of each statement separately and if the latter follows directly from the former. Let's first look at the premise: \\"Meanwhile, Bradley is taking heat for questioning Gore's campaign-finance practices.\\" This statement implies that Bradley, a figure involved in a particular political context, has raised a critical perspective on the campaign-finance practices employed by another political figure, Gore. Consequently, Bradley has faced backlash or criticism for making these accusations. Now consider the hypothesis: \\"Bradley should not have said anything about Gore's campaign-finance practices.\\" The hypothesis posits a normative judgment on Bradley's actions, suggesting that it would have been better if he had refrained from expressing his concerns about Gore's financial practices. To determine if the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise, one must consider whether the fact that Bradley is taking heat for his accusations necessarily implies that he should not have made these allegations in the first place. In this case, the premise does not entail the hypothesis for several reasons: 1. Different interpretations of the situation: The premise only provides information about the consequences of Bradley's actions (i.e., that he is facing criticism), but it does not directly imply whether or not those consequences were warranted. There may be other factors at play that could justify Bradley's decision to raise concerns about Gore's financial practices, even if it led to criticism. 2. Evaluation of risk and consequences: The fact that Bradley is taking heat for questioning Gore's campaign-finance practices does not necessarily imply that he should not have done so. Bradley may have considered and accepted the risks of potential backlash before making his allegations, believing that it was important to bring these issues to light and foster transparency in a political context. 3. Moral and ethical considerations: The hypothesis assumes that not receiving criticism is inherently more valuable than speaking out on potential wrongdoings. However, one could argue that Bradley has a moral or ethical responsibility to disclose information about potentially unethical practices, regardless of the backlash he may face. In conclusion, while the premise reveals that Bradley has faced a negative and perhaps unintended consequence for his actions, it does not entail the hypothesis that he should not have said anything about Gore's campaign-finance practices. The hypothesis suggests a normative judgment that cannot be directly deduced from the premise alone, as the premise does not provide enough information on the rationale, motivations, or potential justifications behind Bradley's decision to question Gore's practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: - There is a fetus in the womb - They are born and are a baby - The baby grows into a child - Puberty turns the child into an adolescent - The adolescent becomes an adult - An adult becomes an elderly person The answer to this question is:","completion":"The final step of the process after an adult becomes an elderly person is the stage of late adulthood, which ultimately leads to the end of one's life cycle. This phase can be described as follows: Late Adulthood: As individuals progress from their adult years into old age, they continue to mature and experience physical, emotional, social, and cognitive transformations. These changes can have numerous variations and characteristics, depending on one's lifestyle, genetics, and any health concerns that may arise. 1. Physical Changes: The aging process often results in a decrease in muscle mass, strength, and flexibility. Elderly individuals may also experience declining bone density, which can increase the risk of fractures. Additionally, there might be a reduced capacity of the various body systems, including the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, as well as a decline in sensory abilities, such as vision and hearing. 2. Cognitive Changes: As individuals reach late adulthood, cognitive functions may decline in certain areas. Memory, processing speed, and problem-solving abilities tend to decline gradually over time. However, cognitive decline is not experienced by everyone to the same extent or rate. Some older adults maintain robust cognitive functioning throughout their golden years, while others may require additional support to perform daily tasks. 3. Emotional Changes: Emotional well-being is a critical aspect of late adulthood, and older individuals often exhibit extraordinary resilience, wisdom, and strength. Some elderly individuals may face life challenges, such as bereavement, loneliness, or health issues. The ability to adapt and cope with these challenges can significantly affect their emotional and mental well-being. 4. Social Changes: Social relationships may continue to evolve in late adulthood as older individuals encounter alterations in their roles and responsibilities. Retirement, grandparenthood, and the loss of friends or family members can generate significant changes in their social circle. Maintaining social connections is essential for overall well-being, as it can provide older adults with a sense of belonging and purpose. 5. Morality and Ethics: Late adulthood allows for a profound contemplation of life, moral values, and personal legacy. Elderly individuals may reflect on their lives, life choices, relationships, and the impact their actions have had on others. This process of introspection can lead to increased wisdom, understanding, compassion, and acceptance of life's complexities. End of the Life Cycle: As the journey of late adulthood progresses, the end of the life cycle approaches. Aging individuals may experience various end-of-life issues, such as preparing for death, managing pain, and discussing their wishes for their final days. The natural process of aging ultimately culminates in death, leading to the conclusion of one's life cycle. However, the legacy that individuals leave behind through their actions, relationships, and contributions to society lives on in the hearts and minds of those they have touched throughout their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Answer the question based on the following text. Question: An elderly person has a higher or lower risk of developing a cardiovascular disease than a young person? Text: The older a person is, the greater their chance of developing a cardiovascular disease. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given text, an elderly person has a higher risk of developing a cardiovascular disease than a younger person. The statement \\"the older a person is, the greater their chance of developing a cardiovascular disease\\" clearly indicates that as age increases, so does the likelihood of experiencing cardiovascular issues. This increased risk can be attributed to various age-related factors, such as the natural aging process of the heart and blood vessels. As a person ages, their arteries can become stiffer and less elastic, leading to a condition known as arteriosclerosis. This reduced elasticity can contribute to a higher risk of developing high blood pressure (hypertension) and other cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and stroke. Additionally, with age, the heart muscle may become less efficient at pumping blood, leading to a decrease in cardiac output. This can result in the heart having to work harder to meet the body's demands for blood and oxygen. Over time, this extra strain on the heart can lead to the development of heart failure or other cardiovascular conditions. Moreover, the body's natural process of repairing and maintaining blood vessels can become less effective as a person ages. This can result in the build-up of plaque, or fatty deposits, on the inner walls of the arteries. This condition, known as atherosclerosis, can further contribute to cardiovascular diseases by obstructing blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Lifestyle factors also play a role in increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease in elderly individuals. Over the years, unhealthy behaviors like smoking, poor diet, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption can accumulate and take a toll on one's cardiovascular health. As a result, these lifestyle choices can make elderly individuals more susceptible to developing heart-related conditions than their younger counterparts. Lastly, older individuals are more likely to have other medical conditions or diseases that can increase their risk of developing cardiovascular disease. These may include diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol levels, which can exacerbate existing heart conditions or contribute to the development of new ones. In conclusion, an elderly person has a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease than a young person due to factors such as age-related changes in the heart and blood vessels, decreased vascular repair and maintenance, harmful lifestyle choices, and the presence of other age-related medical conditions. It is essential for individuals to be aware of these risks and take appropriate steps to maintain their cardiovascular health as they age."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did the team avert from attacking an oil tanker and attempt to attack a warship?\\" is \\"They thought the warship would create a larger explosion\\"?","completion":"Based on the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Why did the team avert from attacking an oil tanker and attempt to attack a warship?\\" is \\"Because Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S. warship instead.\\" The reason for this change in target selection is not explicitly stated in the paragraph, but it can be inferred that Bin Laden chose this target for strategic or symbolic reasons rather than the size of the explosion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Evidence supporting Hypothesis 1: The speaker emphasizes that they think the most important issue is the governance of the public purse, which consists of approving taxation and spending 145 billion of taxpayer money. This demonstrates their belief that managing these aspects of the government is of vital importance. Hypothesis 2: The speaker is concerned about the seriousness with which parliamentary debates in the House of Commons are conducted regarding public spending. Evidence supporting Hypothesis 2: The statement mentions that the speaker expects the House of Commons to take the debates regarding the spending of taxpayer money very seriously, showcasing their concern towards the gravity of the matter. Hypothesis 3: The speaker is likely a member of parliament, addressing others in the House of Commons. Evidence supporting Hypothesis 3: The speaker refers to \\"Mr. Speaker,\\" indicating that they are addressing the presiding officer in the House of Commons. It also suggests that the speaker is a participant in the ongoing debates within the legislative body. To sum up, while we cannot draw a hypothesis regarding the age of the agent based on the given context, we can infer valuable information about their concerns related to public spending, taxation, and the conduct of parliamentary debates."},{"prompt":"This article: Ben Anthony runs a freight line in Texas.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to 0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements.... and the situation: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A. Answer the following question: Which would have higher specific gravity, item A or item B? Answer:","completion":"Item A, the Earth, would have a higher specific gravity compared to item B, the surface rock. The Earth's mean specific gravity is 5.515, whereas the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface ranges from 2.7 to 3.3. This difference implies that the Earth's deeper material is denser than the surface rocks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"Review Title: Unsatisfactory Experience with the WordPress Android Application Rating: 2/5 I'm offering a 2-star rating for the WordPress Android app, the package with the identifier org.wordpress.android, as my experience using it didn't quite meet expectations. The criteria I considered when giving this review revolve around four main aspects: functionality, user interface, reliability, and customer support. Unfortunately, all of these domains proved to be more problematic than I expected when I first downloaded the app. Firstly, let's talk about functionality. The WordPress Android app is designed to provide an easy-to-use mobile interface for managing WordPress websites. While it does offer some useful features, such as the ability to publish new posts, manage comments, and view basic site stats, I regrettably found the overall functionality to be lacking compared to the desktop version. There are many advanced features, like plugins and complex theme setups, that this app partially or entirely fails to handle. It seems only to be nice for basic blogging but not for deeper customizations. On the topic of the user interface, it has not been particularly enjoyable to navigate either. It feels a bit clunky and unintuitive. The tools and options do not seem well-organized and at times, it seems harder to locate certain features without a lot of unnecessary clicking and scrolling. Furthermore, the editor's choice to place HTML and visual interfaces away from each other makes it challenging for users who integrate both into their workflow. The reliability factor of this app didn't impress me too much either. It has been prone to occasional crashes during use, which not only forced me to constantly save my progress to avoid losing any work but also significantly interrupted my workflow. The app occasionally logs me out unexpectedly, which is very inconvenient, especially when I'm in the middle of drafting or editing a post. Lastly, customer support has been a let-down as well. While user queries are responded to eventually, the responses are often delayed, and it seems there are more user complaints than the support team can handle. Also, many times, the solutions provided are either temporary or don’t address the root problem, indicating a lack of depth in understanding customer issues. However, despite my disappointments, I did find some merits in this application. The app allows preparing posts offline, which is a blessing when you're away from a steady internet connection. Also, it has a nice feature to directly upload photos from the phone gallery. Even with these positives, it’s hard not to think that with some more thought and development work, the functionality of this app could significantly improve. I understand making a mobile platform work as well as a desktop version isn't easy, but given WordPress's reputation, my expectations were much higher. Overall, my experience with the WordPress Android app has been less than ideal. While it isn't entirely unusable, it lacks the robustness I would have expected for managing and creating WordPress sites on the go. I hope the team behind the app will take criticisms into account and work towards improving the app's shortcomings. Until then, I would recommend users to manage their expectations when using this app."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Background: Robert Lee \\"Bullet Bob\\" Hayes (December 20, 1942 - September 18, 2002) was an Olympic sprinter turned American football wide receiver in the National Football League for the Dallas Cowboys. An American track and field athlete, he was a two-sport stand-out in college in both track and football at Florida A&M University. He has one of the top 100 meter times by NFL players. Hayes was enshrined in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 2001 and was selected for induction in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in January 2009. Context: At the 1964 Summer Olympics, in Tokyo, Hayes had his finest hour as a sprinter. First, he won the 100m and in doing so tied the then world record in the 100 m with a time of 10.06 seconds, even though he was running in lane 1 which had, the day before, been used for the 20 km racewalk and this badly chewed up the cinder track. He also was running in borrowed spikes because one of his shoes had been kicked under the bed when he was playing with some friends and he didn't realize until he got there. This was followed by a second gold medal in the 4x100 meter relay, which also produced a new World Record (39.06 seconds). His come-from-behind win for the US team in the relay was one of the most memorable Olympic moments. Hand-timed between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds, his relay leg is the fastest in history. Jocelyn Delecour, France's anchor leg runner, famously said to Paul Drayton before the relay final that, \\"You can't win, all you have is Bob Hayes.\\" Drayton was able to reply afterwards, \\"That's all we need.\\" The race was also Hayes' last as a track and field athlete, as he permanently switched to football after it, aged only 21. In some of the first meets to be timed with experimental fully automatic timing, Hayes was the first man to break ten seconds for the 100 meters, albeit with a 5.3 m/s wind assistance in the semi-finals of the 1964 Olympics. His time was recorded at 9.91 seconds. Jim Hines officially broke 10 seconds at the high altitude of Mexico City, Mexico in 1968 (and on a synthetic track) with a wind legal 9.95 which stood as the world record for almost 15 years. The next to surpass Hayes at a low altitude Olympics was Carl Lewis in 1984 when he won in 9.99, some 20 years later (though Hasely Crawford equaled the time in 1976). Until the Tokyo Olympics, world records were measured by officials with stopwatches, measured to the nearest tenth of a second. Although fully automatic timing was used in Tokyo, the times were given the appearance of manual timing. This was done by subtracting 0.05 seconds from the automatic time and rounding to the nearest tenth of a second, making Hayes' time of 10.06 seconds convert to 10.0 seconds, despite the fact that the officials with stopwatches had measured Hayes' time to be 9.9 seconds, and the average difference between manual and automatic times was typically 0.15 to 0.20 seconds. This unique method of determining the official time therefore denied Hayes the record of being the first to officially record 9.9 seconds for the 100 meters. The first official times of 9.9 seconds were recorded at the \\"Night of Speed\\" in 1968. Question: What Olympic events did Hayes participate in?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Bob Hayes participated in two events at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. First, he competed in the 100-meter sprint where he won the gold medal and tied the world record at the time with a time of 10.06 seconds. Second, Hayes was part of the United States' 4x100-meter relay team, where he won another gold medal and helped set a new world record with a time of 39.06 seconds. Hayes' incredible come-from-behind performance during the relay's anchor leg is widely considered one of the most memorable Olympic moments, with his hand-timed split between 8.5 and 8.9 seconds being the fastest relay leg in history. After these successes in the Olympics, Hayes decided to retire from track and field at the age of 21 and pursue his career in American football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

CCTV footage from one attack on their £500,000 crime spree shows a mother sprinting to protect her terrified son as the eight men swamped and then burgled a Carphone Warehouse. On each occasion the criminals caused 'total mayhem' when they stormed high street shops to wrench high-value items from the walls in a series of violent 'steaming' raids. In scenes reminiscent of the recent London Riots, phones and tablet computers worth a total. of £143,000 were ripped out by the thieves, while the attacks caused more than £50,000. worth of damage. Scroll down for video. Terrifying: The gang are shown here dragging electronics from the walls of this Carphone Warehouse in a New Year's Eve raid last year. Aftermath: As they sprint for the door the trail of destruction the criminals left behind shows the violence and speed of their attacks. Violence: As the gang terrorise another store a mother is shown sweeping her young son away from them (bottom right) as they go on the rampage. The criminals, some of whom were just 14,. used the 'steaming' technique, where they rob shops or mug individuals by. swamping them and threatening them with violence. The clean-up operation after the raids, which forced some stores to close temporarily, resulted in Carphone Warehouse losing a total of more than £500,000, the court heard. Passing sentence, Judge Peter Testar said: 'This conspiracy to burgle consists of a series of offences in which a number of young men rushed into branches of Carphone Warehouse and simply grabbed whatever they were able to and ran away. 'In some cases, efforts were made to. disguise appearances, but in many cases the attitude of those who. committed these offences was brazen. 'Those. who have joined the conspiracy have applied themselves to a criminal. operation of which the overall effect was very great. 'The targeting of particular premises and the mob handed means of offending indicates greater harm. 'The success (of the conspiracy) depended on force of numbers and shock. 'Many staff and customers were very frightened. 'In. one incident, a small child found himself, much to his terror and that. of his parents, being surrounded by the marauding group. 'Most of the events saw participation by more than those who have admitted responsibility for them.' Sentenced: (Top L - Bottom R) Ugo Wilson, Jahreau Shepherd, Emmanuel Kakala, and Perry Hedges were part of the gang that raided 40 stores in a £500,000 crime spree across London. Judge Testar also praised the 'good old fashioned police work' involved in bringing the gang to justice. The 'steaming' spree took place between July 1, 2012 and January 11 this year, prosecutor Edward Lucas told the court. 'The. defendants had a total disregard for the presence of customers, old or. young, when they were embarking on their criminal enterprise. 'They were always mob handed and caused total chaos. Children were pushed out of the way and forced to run away. 'These. young men, of various ages, with the youngest being just 14 at the time. of the ending, targeted Carphone Warehouses through the London and. Greater London area. 'In. groups of three or more, they went into the premises, mostly during the. afternoon, and literally ripped telephones from their displays. 'The. shops were operating as normal and the staff were on duty at the time. serving customers, and of course they were terrified by what occurred. 'Children can be seen running for cover to their parents.' Horror: The frozen child is shown in the bottom right of the screen as the criminals pull electronics from the walls around him. Fear: A mother then tears across to protect the young boy from the marauding gang. Shocked shoppers who happened to get in the way of the enterprise were simply told to stand aside or else. 'There was a menace, don't mess with us, if you get in the way there is going to be trouble,' said Mr Lucas. 'The. staff say they were extremely shocked and frightened by what occurred. They were not only frightened for themselves but also for their. customers. 'The. psychological effect cannot be minimised and the reality is that the. consequences (for shop staff and' customers) have been profound. More thugs who took part in the raids remain at large and none of the goods have been recovered. 'The. fact of the matter is the crimes themselves seem to have occurred. within the context of the individuals really not caring who is in the. shop at the time. 'They went in to steal and caused total mayhem,' added Mr Lucas. Jahreau. Shepherd, 22, who was on licence for robbery at the time of the. attacks, was jailed for four years, while Ugo Wilson, 21, was given a. 27-month prison term. Ryan.

The correct answer is d) because it continues the paragraph by providing a relevant and coherent detail about the scene, which takes place outdoors in a park. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: a). This option introduces a cube and the squirrel going mad, which is not relevant to the context of the paragraph. The story is about a cricket game and people playing, not a squirrel encountering an unrelated object or acting strangely. b). The option suggests that the squirrel and its owner are indoors, in the corner of a room playing, which contradicts the paragraph's setting of an outdoor cricket game. Additionally, squirrels are not typically considered as pets with owners, further disconnecting this option from the paragraph's context. c). Squirrels are animals and do not have thumbs, so they cannot give a thumbs up.

Update: they are disabled. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the hypothesis sentence Usage: Hypothesis: It is rude to laugh at other people. This part of the definition establishes the socially normative behavior that we expect from people in general situations. In this case, the general expectation is that laughing at other people is considered rude. Part #2: Identifying the update Usage: Update: they are disabled. This part of the definition provides additional context to the situation. In this case, the context is that the person being laughed at is disabled. Part #3: Determine if the update undermines or supports the hypothesis Usage: Since laughing at disabled people would generally be considered even more rude, the update strengthens the hypothesis that it is rude to laugh at other people.

Throughout a series of TV interviews, Romney sought to clarify his role at the private equity firm, insisting that he in fact retired from an active management role at Bain in February of 1999 and that his continued association with the firm was purely in the capacity of a shareholder. The issue of Romney's tenure at Bain Capital has become a focal point of the 2012 presidential campaign, with opponents of the Republican candidate using his association with the private equity firm to paint him as an out-of-touch millionaire who profited off the misery of others. The Obama campaign has specifically targeted Romney's record at Bain to highlight instances of layoffs and offshoring that occurred during his tenure, while also questioning the veracity of his claims that he left the firm in 1999. Speaking to CNN, Romney defended his association with Bain Capital, stating, \\"There's nothing wrong with being associated with Bain Capital, of course.\\" He reiterated that his departure from the firm took place in February 1999, despite documents listing him as holding key positions at Bain even after that date. To address these discrepancies, Romney told CBS, \\"I still retained an ownership interest. I had the capacity if I were not on leave, if I were actually wanting to run the business to do so, but I did not.\\" He further elucidated the distinction between playing an active management role and being a shareholder: “There is a difference between being a shareholder, an owner if you will, than a person who is running an entity.” Romney also went on the offensive against the Obama campaign's tactics during his media appearances. In response to an Obama adviser's suggestion that he could be guilty of a felony, Romney told ABC News, \\"This is simply beneath the dignity of the presidency of the United States.\\" He implored President Obama to \\"rein in his team\\" and \\"finally take responsibility for what they're saying,\\" during an interview with Fox News. “What kind of a president would have a campaign that says something like that about the nominee of another party?” he remarked. When asked if he believes Obama owes him an apology, Romney responded, \\"Absolutely—my goodness!\\" Politico and the AP provided comprehensive roundups of Romney's flurry of TV appearances, bringing the debate over his role at Bain Capital back into the spotlight. While this renewed focus on his tenure at the firm may prove troublesome for Romney's campaign, his decision to confront the issue head-on and demand an apology from his opponent demonstrates a willingness to take the fight to the president and defend his record as a businessman. As the presidential election approaches, it remains to be seen how these renewed discussions about Romney’s role at Bain Capital will impact his chances of winning the presidency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Blues' run of just two wins in 15 league games since Zola took charge on 14 December has been alarming. \\"If we play like this, we cannot say we are safe,\\" he told BBC WM after Tuesday's 1-0 home defeat by 23rd-placed Wigan Athletic. \\"I have got a lot of anger inside. We looked childish in what we did.\\" From being level on points with sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday when they won at home to Ipswich Town on 13 December, the night before Gary Rowett was sacked, Blues have picked up nine points under Zola out of a possible 45 and are now only eight points clear of the relegation zone. Now they face being further sucked into trouble with a testing four-match run of three away games, starting at Neil Warnock's Cardiff this Saturday, and the visit to St Andrew's of Championship leaders Newcastle United, who knocked Zola's side out of the FA Cup after a replay in January. \\"Too many players are hiding,\\" Zola said. \\"But I am not going to hide from my responsibilities. This is an ambitious club and it deserves better.\\" After failing to earn a win in his first 10 league games in charge of Blues, it looked like Zola's side had turned a corner when they beat promotion-chasing Fulham at home on 4 February. But three more defeats then followed before Blues enjoyed their first away win under the Italian, the local derby win with 10 men against Wolves at Molineux. Although his side played very well for an hour and had enough chances to have won comfortably in Friday night's 3-1 home defeat by Leeds, Tuesday's 1-0 loss to Wigan was generally considered to be their worst performance of the entire campaign. They managed just two shots on target against a side in the relegation zone who had won just once in eight matches. Asked whether he would consider resigning, Zola admitted: \\"If some of the supporters feel the manager needs to change I totally understand that.\\" But, with 10 games of the season left, six of which are away from home, he said he needs time to assess the way forward for both him and the club. \\"It's too early to say something like that,\\" he added. \\"I don't want to consider it now.

Answer this question: what is the largest mountain free land area in europe??","completion":"The largest mountain-free land area in Europe is the European Plain, sometimes referred to as the European Lowlands or the North European Plain. The European Plain spans across multiple countries, predominantly situated in the northern and central regions of the continent. It extends from the Atlantic coast of France in the west, through central Europe, to the Ural Mountains in Russia, which acts as the natural border of Eastern Europe. This vast, generally flat, lowland region covers an area that includes significant parts of several countries such as France, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, along with parts of Denmark, Belgium, Czech Republic, Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania). Moreover, it also covers a significant portion of eastern Russia, stretching almost 4,000 kilometers from west to east. The European Plain has a diverse climate, largely influenced by its vast size and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Temperatures vary widely across the region, with milder climates in the west and more continental climates towards the east. The plain experiences substantial precipitation due to westerly winds from the Atlantic Ocean, creating fertile farmlands ideal for agriculture. The terrain of the European Plain ranges from gently rolling hills to entirely flat land, with elevations that do not surpass 200 meters above sea level. The region is characterized by several major rivers such as the Danube, Rhine, Elbe, Oder, and Vistula that shape the landscape and provide crucial water sources for human settlements and agriculture. Overall, this extensive plain is a topographical anomaly in a continent known for its diverse mountain ranges, such as the Alps, Carpathians, and Pyrenees. In conclusion, the largest mountain-free land area in Europe is the European Plain, which spans thousands of kilometers across various countries in the northern and central regions of the continent. This extensive, flat expanse of land encompasses numerous major rivers, supports diverse ecosystems, and is home to a significant portion of Europe's population due to its favorable conditions for agriculture and human habitation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Recorded originally by Willie Mae \\"Big Mama\\" Thornton on August 13, 1952, in Los Angeles and released by Peacock Records in late February 1953, \\"Hound Dog\\" was Thornton's only hit record, selling over 500,000 copies, spending 14 weeks in the R&B charts, including seven weeks at number one. Thornton's recording of \\"Hound Dog\\" is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's \\"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\\", and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in February 2013. \\"Hound Dog\\" has been recorded more than 250 times. The best-known version is the July 1956 recording by Elvis Presley, which is ranked number 19 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time; it is also one of the best-selling singles of all time. Two records were released that were neither cover versions of nor answers to Thornton's release, yet used a similar melody without any attribution to Leiber and Stoller. The first was Smiley Lewis's \\"Play Girl\\", credited to D. Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label (Imperial 45-5234) by the end of March 1953. Described as a \\"stomping uptempo boogie rocker\\", it began: \\"You ain't nothin' but a Play Girl / Staying out all night long\\". In April 1955, female impersonator Jesse \\"Big 'Tiny'\\" Kennedy recorded \\"Country Boy\\" accompanied by His Orchestra that was released by RCA's Groove Records (Groove 4G-0106) by May 21. While credited solely to Kennedy, this song has a similar melody to \\"Hound Dog\\": \\"'Country Boy' has a deceptively slouching flip on the 'Hound Dog' motif - this time with Tiny proclaiming proudly that he 'ain't nothing but a country boy'\\". In the early 1970s Robert Loers, owner of Dutch label Redita Records, found a song with the same melody as \\"Hound Dog\\" called \\"(You Ain't Nuttin' But a) Juicehead\\" on an anonymous acetate at Select-o-Hits, the Memphis distributorship owned by Sam Phillips' brother, Tom, where Sun artifacts were stored. When Juice Head first appeared on a Redita Records LP [in 1974], it was credited to Rosco Gordon. But it's not Rosco. It simply is not him. Really. Even Rosco confirmed that. It might not even be a Memphis Recording Service demo. Just substitute the words \\"Hound Dog\\" for \\"Juice Head\\" and what have you got? Of course the inspiration for this song came from Big Mama Thornton's \\"Hound Dog\\" or perhaps even from Rufus Thomas' \\"Bear Cat\\". But the song's other parent is Eddie Vinson's slowed down \\"Juicehead Blues\\" which harks to the previous decade...If indeed this originated from Sam Phillips' studio, it was nothing that Phillips needed to touch because it was another lawsuit waiting to happen.\\" Philip H.

My three sisters and I grew up in a small bedroom with two sets of beds. We shared a closet, a dresser, and just about everything else. I had friends who were only children. I looked longingly at their perfect dolls and toys placed carefully on their perfect shelves in their perfect little girl bedrooms. They had bathrooms to themselves. _ . Our bedroom always had stuff hanging about. There just wasn't room to store the paraphernalia of four girls who had definite ideas about how they wanted their space to be.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth. Question: \\"What did Gandhi disagree about with Winston Churchill?\\" Answer: \\"Indian independence\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"Yes, this answer is correct. Gandhi and Winston Churchill disagreed on the issue of Indian independence. While Gandhi was a staunch advocate for Indian independence from British rule and worked tirelessly to achieve this, Winston Churchill was against granting independence to India and wanted to maintain British control over the country."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question 1: What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an electoral college over a popular vote? Question 2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of the Electoral College? Select from the following. a). no. b). yes. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. The Electoral College is an indirect method of selecting the President of the United States, wherein citizens vote for electors who then cast their votes on the citizens' behalf. A popular vote, on the other hand, directly counts the votes of citizens to determine the winner. Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of the Electoral College: 1. Balance of power: The Electoral College prevents highly populous states from dominating presidential elections. Since each state has a certain number of electors based on its number of Congressional representatives, smaller states still have a voice in the process. 2. Discourages election fraud: The Electoral College can make it more difficult for a candidate to win solely through election fraud. Attempts to fraudulently manipulate votes would need to happen across multiple states, making it more complex and harder to coordinate. 3. Decisive outcome: The Electoral College often produces clear winners and prompts presidential nominees to win a higher percentage of the popular vote in each state. This often means that the president-elect has a greater mandate to govern when they win under this system. 4. Promotes a two-party system: The Electoral College encourages a stable, two-party system by making it challenging for third-party candidates to win electoral votes. This helps ensure that candidates are more moderate and less likely to have extremist views. Disadvantages of the Electoral College: 1. Not directly reflective of popular will: The candidate with the most popular votes may not win the presidency because of the way electoral votes are allocated. This has happened multiple times in U.S. history, where the candidate winning the popular vote did not win the presidency. 2. Focus on swing states: Candidates mainly target battleground or swing states, where elections are closely contested. As a result, they may ignore the needs and concerns of citizens in states that are firmly aligned with one party or another. 3. Diminished voter motivation: Voters in non-swing states may feel their vote carries less weight, as their state's electoral vote outcome is relatively predetermined. This could lead to apathy and reduced voter turnout. 4. Disproportionate representation: The allocation of electoral votes gives greater weight to some states' votes due to the relationship between population size and the number of electors. Voters in smaller states have more influence per person than voters in larger states, which can create a disparity in representation. Advantages of a popular vote: 1. Equal representation: A popular vote does not prioritize any state or group of citizens, ensuring that every vote counts equally and making the process more democratic. 2. Nationwide campaign focus: Candidates would be encouraged to address the needs and concerns of all citizens across the country, rather than just battleground states. 3. Higher voter participation: Knowing that their vote carries equal weight, voters may be more likely to participate in the election process, increasing voter turnout and engagement. 4. Simplified vote counting: Directly counting the popular vote eliminates the need for complex Electoral College calculations, making the process simpler and more transparent. Disadvantages of a popular vote: 1. Potential for increased electoral fraud: With a single vote pool, a concentrated effort in one location could potentially sway the entire election outcome, making vote manipulation more impactful. 2. Disruption of the two-party system: The current two-party system, which provides stability in government, may be disrupted, leading to a rise in third-party candidates and potentially less moderation in viewpoints. 3. Close elections may create administrative challenges: In elections with tight margins, there may be an increased need for recounts and legal battles, which could delay the confirmation of the winner and generate uncertainty. 4. Urban focus: In a popular vote system, candidates might focus their campaigns on densely populated urban areas, neglecting the unique needs and concerns of rural and small-town citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will Kai want to do next?\\", is \\"be less forgetful\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"\\"Be less forgetful\\" may be an overarching goal for Kai, but it does not directly address the immediate problem of forgetting their wallet at home. Therefore, while it's a valid concern related to the situation, it isn't a valid answer to the question, \\"What will Kai want to do next?\\". A more appropriate answer should focus on how Kai can address the current issue of having left their wallet at home and the possible steps they might take. To provide a detailed and long answer, we can consider several scenarios based on the importance of having the wallet, the distance to their home, and other important factors. Immediate Action: If Kai has realized they forgot their wallet shortly after leaving home and they are not far away, they might want to go back and retrieve the wallet before proceeding with their plans. This would ensure that they have necessary identification, payment methods, and other items that might be in the wallet. Alternatives: If returning home is not an immediate option, Kai might consider alternative solutions based on their current needs. For instance, if they need to make a payment, they could find alternative means such as using a mobile payment app or borrowing money from a friend or family member. Safety Concern: Another consideration would be ensuring their wallet is secure. If Kai is worried that their wallet might be lost or stolen, they might want to call a family member or roommate to check if the wallet is safe at home. Also, they should keep an eye on their bank accounts and credit cards for any unusual activities. Planning Ahead: In case Kai is unable to resolve the situation immediately, they might need to plan their day accordingly. They could prioritize activities that do not require the wallet, such as visiting places where no payment or identification is needed, or rescheduling appointments that require identification for a later time. Preventive Measures for Future: As for addressing the issue of forgetfulness, Kai might consider adopting habits or strategies to avoid leaving important items behind. Some suggestions include having a designated place for their wallet, using reminder apps, or establishing a routine to double-check important items before leaving the house. In conclusion, while \\"be less forgetful\\" is a valid concern for Kai to address in the long term, it doesn't properly answer the question of what they would want to do next in this specific situation. Instead, focusing on immediate actions, safety concerns, alternatives, and plans for the day would provide a more accurate and actionable response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: practices by considering the scope of various types of audits and Here is a hypothesis: There is only one type of audit.

First, let's break down the premise: \\"Practices by considering the scope of various types of audits.\\" This statement suggests that the approach one takes involves analyzing different types of audits. It implies that there is a variety of audit types with differing scopes. Now, let's examine the hypothesis: \\"There is only one type of audit.\\" This statement contradicts the premise as it claims there is just a single type of audit. In other words, the hypothesis denies the existence of various audit types implied by the premise. Given the premise's indication that there are multiple audit types with varying scopes, it is not reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The contradiction between the premise and hypothesis suggests that they cannot both be accurate. If the premise is assumed to be true, claiming multiple types of audits, then the hypothesis, which asserts only one type of audit, must be false. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the premise, it is not possible to accept that the hypothesis is true. The premise and hypothesis are in opposition, and one must be inaccurate if the other is deemed true.

News article: 2 Deputies Killed and 2 Hurt in Louisiana Shootings Two sheriff’s deputies in Louisiana were killed and two others were wounded in separate but related shootings on Thursday morning in what the authorities described as an “ambush” in a rural town northwest of New Orleans. Many details remain unclear about the shootings, which occurred about 5:30 a.m. in an industrial section of LaPlace, in Saint John the Baptist Parish, Sheriff Mike Tregre said at a news conference. “I lost two good officers today,” Sheriff Tregre said as he fought back tears. “Please pray for the officers who were ambushed.” Sheriff Tregre said the events unfolded as two of his deputies working a traffic detail in an oil refinery parking lot were shot by someone inside a car they had stopped. The reason for the stop was not immediately known, but deputies were able to arrest the gunman, the sheriff said. Moments later, Sheriff Tregre said, the authorities received an emergency call about a speeding car that had just left the refinery lot and had gone to a nearby trailer park. When deputies located the car outside a trailer, they were greeted at the door by a man with a dog, but were able to see inside, where they saw a man who appeared to be hiding, fully clothed, under a blanket, Sheriff Tregre said. Within seconds, the deputies found themselves being shot at by a man with an assault rifle, according to the sheriff. “For some unknown reason, a gunman opened fire,” said Sheriff Tregre, who has been in office for only 45 days. The deceased officers were identified as Brandon Nielson, 34, and Jeremy Triche, 28. The two wounded deputies are in surgery with multiple gunshot wounds.

In a press conference held earlier today, Facebook announced the launch of its brand-new location features designed to allow users to interact with their surroundings more dynamically than ever before. Mark Zuckerberg himself provided a comprehensive walkthrough of the latest additions, giving the audience an exclusive inside look at what's in store for the millions of Facebook users worldwide. The Location Features Revolution: The primary focus of Facebook's new location features is to bring innovative ways for users to share their real-world experiences with their online friends and community. The latest update contains three core elements: Interactive Maps, Live Location Tracking, and Community Collaboration, making it easier than ever before to see what's happening around the world at any given moment. 1. Interactive Maps: Interactive Maps offers users a visual representation of their surroundings, allowing them to access information about local businesses, events, attractions, and other points of interest. This feature is more than just a map, however; it's designed as a social platform where users can see what their friends are recommending, check into locations, leave reviews, and even partake in discussions or ask questions about a specific place. Facebook's integration of the Interactive Maps will grant users the ability to customize their personal maps based on their preferences, whether it's a map focused on nearby restaurants, museums, or parks. Users can create and save multiple maps for different purposes or share them with friends for collaborative planning and exploration. 2. Live Location Tracking: The Live Location Tracking is Facebook's answer to the increasing demand for real-time location sharing across different applications. This feature allows users to share their current location with friends or a specific group of people for a set period. It's an excellent tool for coordinating meet-ups, ensuring everyone's safety during events, or just keeping in touch with loved ones. Users can choose who has access to their Live Location, ensuring that their privacy is maintained while still enjoying the convenience of real-time location sharing. The feature also works seamlessly across devices – one can share their Live Location from their mobile device and others can view it on desktop computers, tablets, or any platform where Facebook is accessible. 3. Community Collaboration: Facebook's Community Collaboration takes social engagement to new heights, paving the way for users to contribute to the local community by sharing recommendations, reviews, or even reporting neighborhood problems. This feature encourages users to become responsible citizens and foster a more sustainable living environment. Elements of Community Collaboration include the ability to explore neighborhood-focused groups, report and discuss local issues, and even collaborate on crowdfunding projects for community improvement. By fostering a collective sense of responsibility, Facebook's new location features bring communities closer together and create a more connected world. In Conclusion: The introduction of Facebook's new location features is a gamechanger in the world of social media, allowing users to immerse themselves in their environment and integrate online interactions with real-life experiences. As millions of users eagerly await the live roll-out of these features, it's clear that Facebook is leading the charge in revolutionizing the future of digital engagement. So, what are you waiting for? Fire up your Facebook account, dive into the new location features, and explore the world around you with the support and companionship of your virtual community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Parisians are from which continent?\\" is in \\"During his time as an American envoy to France, Benjamin Franklin, publisher of the old English proverb, \\"Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise\\", anonymously published a letter suggesting that Parisians economize on candles by rising earlier to use morning sunlight. This 1784 satire proposed taxing shutters, rationing candles, and waking the public by ringing church bells and firing cannons at sunrise. Despite common misconception, Franklin did not actually propose DST; 18th-century Europe did not even keep precise schedules.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Place the items together in one area. A plastic mixing container Wooden chopstick Dry pigment Painting spatula An acrylic base Solution (water or an alcohol like rubbing alcohol) Acrylic retarder You can use the flat side of a painting spatula to apply pressure until you do not feel any “grittiness. Paint pigments sold in arts supply stores usually come in powdered form. Many artists also choose to find alternative pigments based on crushed dried plants or other substances. Grind the pigment until you do not feel any \\"grittiness\\" as you apply pressure. Most pigments will break down fairly easily, so just make sure that there are no irregular lumps remaining. If the pigment has come in powdered form, you may not need to grind it unless it is lumpy. Before you begin mixing the components together, you should measure and record the quantity of pigment and base used. You may need to make more of a color before you finish a painting or to retouch a painting. You can only do so with consistency if you know how much pigment and acrylic base you used. Acrylic base is essentially paint without pigment. It will usually come in a squeezable tube and the substance itself will appear white. There are several different sorts, such as glossy or matte, and you must determine which type you need for your painting. Use the wooden chopstick to mix them thoroughly together, until the pigment is evenly dispersed throughout the acrylic base. Read the instructions that came with your acrylic binder because the preferred ratio of base to solution varies from brand to brand. Some pigments (especially organic ones) have a tendency to float on water. In this case you would substitute alcohol. Make sure you are using a solution appropriate for the pigment. It’s not ideal to mix alcohol into acrylic paints because alcohol dries quickly, causing the paint to also dry quickly. If you are using a pigment that mixes best with alcohol but want the paint to dry more slowly, you can add water after you have mixed the pigment with alcohol. Too much water or alcohol will dilute the acrylic binder, so be careful. Acrylic retarder helps to slow how quickly acrylic paint dries. It’s important to follow the instructions that came with your acrylic retarder. However, a general rule of thumb is that more retarder used, the slower the acrylic paint will dry. You can figure out ratios of your own liking as you become accustomed to its use. Acrylic retarders are especially necessary if you are attempting to create photorealistic paintings or portraits of a human subject. Colors must be blended together on the canvas to create the contours of complex shapes, but fast-drying acrylics will set before a second color can be added. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article provides a detailed guide on how to create customized acrylic paints by mixing dry pigments with an acrylic base.

I remember back in the late 1970’s when I first started investing in property as a young guy, being taken to a house that felt EXTREMELY cold, strange, and rather chilling. Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property. However despite that being a good location, it was reputation that deterred me on that occasion. Sometimes there are situations where even the best makeover will not work.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Illinois, 1994. As part of his college thesis, 18-year-old Jason Moss (Jesse Moss) decides to write to serial killers and attempt to gain their trust through impersonating a typical victim or admirer. He reasoned that gaining their trust, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.He sends a carefully crafted letter to John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe) in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable boy. The film unfolds as Gacy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through intense emotional tests via letters and collect calls, and an eventual face-to-face visit in prison.The story opens with Moss's fascination in Gacy's case as Gacy, having spent 14 years on death row, awaits the court's decision regarding his final appeal. Moss, an apt criminology student, forms a plan to \\"get inside the head\\" of Gacy, hoping to uncover new information regarding Gacy's murders and write a standout term paper on Gacy in the process.He sends Gacy his first letter, and is at first untruthful, telling him he has no girlfriend and a bad relationship with his supposedly controlling and abusive parents. He also states that his little brother, who is being bullied at school, sees him as a hero and would do anything for him. Gacy's first response is to send a questionnaire regarding Moss's personal and sex life. Moss, seeing an interview in which Gacy admits to engaging in sodomy, adopts a different tact. He begins working out, taking pictures of himself posing topless, and portraying himself as increasingly vulnerable and lonely in his letters. He informs Gacy that he has considered hustling or nude dancing in order to earn extra money. Gacy, beginning to open up, acts understanding and supportive in his letters, encouraging Moss to take up hustling and even giving him advice on technique and safety precautions, asking Moss to \\"tell me all about it... don't hold back.\\"Moss, not wanting to lose the connection he has made with Gacy, but unwilling to go quite so...

During his retirement, Johnson began intense workouts to help his fight against HIV, raising his bench press from 135 to 300 pounds, and increasing his weight to 255 pounds. He officially returned to the team on January 29, 1996, and played his first game the following day against the 1995–96 Golden State Warriors season. Coming off the bench, Johnson had 19 points, 8 rebounds, and 10 assists to help the Lakers to a 128–118 victory. On February 14, Johnson recorded the final triple-double of his career, when he scored 15 points, along with 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a victory against the 1995–96 Atlanta Hawks season. Playing Power forward (basketball), he averaged 14.6 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds per game in 32 games, and finished tied for 12th place with Charles Barkley in voting for the MVP Award.

Nick Van Exel received a seven-game suspension for bumping referee Ron Garretson during a game on April 9. Johnson was publicly critical of Van Exel, saying his actions were \\"inexcusable.\\" Ironically Johnson was himself suspended five days later, when he bumped referee Scott Foster, missing three games.

Write a summary based on this article: President Obama on Wednesday delivered a sharply personal rebuke of GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz Ted CruzMichele Bachmann: God picked Trump to be the GOP nominee Trump at immigration crossroads Poll: Majority of GOP voters wish they chose another presidential nominee MORE for his call to institute surveillance on Muslim communities in response to the Brussels terrorist attacks. During a press conference in Argentina, Obama called such a proposal “wrong and un-American” and said it would undermine the U.S. campaign against Islamic extremists. ADVERTISEMENT Obama invoked Cruz’s Cuban heritage, arguing the Texas senator was ignoring the personal journey of his father, who fled the island nation for the United States to escape political oppression. “I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance, which, by the way, the father of Sen. Cruz escaped for America,” the president said. “The land of the free. The notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense.” It was the second day in a row Obama addressed the series of blasts in the Belgian capital that killed at least 31 people and injured more than 180, including a dozen Americans. The Brussels attacks shook up the presidential campaign with fresh concerns about the threat of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. Some Republican candidates have called for drastic measures to prevent a similar strike in the U.S. Cruz said Muslim neighborhoods should be put under special watch by authorities in order to preempt any future attacks in the U.S. GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump Donald Trump5 things to watch for in Trump's immigration speech Deportations under Obama could hit 10-year low Trump softens rhetoric in pitch to black voters MORE backed Cruz on the patrols and renewed his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country and for waterboarding to be used on terrorism suspects. The proposals touched off a fierce political debate, with Democrats accusing Trump and Cruz of encouraging Islamophobia to win over conservative votes. Candidates on both sides of the aisle called for tougher security measures in the U.S. and demanded Obama take a more aggressive approach to fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which claimed responsibility for the attacks. But Obama indicated he would not make significant changes to his anti-ISIS strategy \\"simply because it's political season.\\" The president said defeating the group is his “No. 1 priority,” but it must be done in a “smart” way. “As our strategy evolves and we see additional opportunities, we will go after it,” Obama said. But he said the U.S. should not “take approaches that will be counterproductive,\\" such as carpet-bombing Middle Eastern countries, an idea Cruz proposed. “Not only is that inhumane, not only is that contrary to our values, but that would likely be an extraordinary mechanism for ISIL to recruit more,\\" Obama said, using an alternate acronym for the group. “That’s not a smart strategy.” The president pledged he would \\"continue to go after ISIL aggressively until it is removed from Syria and removed from Iraq and is finally destroyed.\\" The U.S. has relied on airstrikes to fight the extremist group and has mostly turned to local forces on the ground, resisting calls for a large-scale ground campaign. American special operations forces have carried out strikes against certain ISIS targets, and the Marines recently set up a base in northern Iraq with around 200 troops. One Marine was killed in an ISIS rocket attack there last Saturday. At the same time, Obama reiterated his belief that the group does not pose \\"an existential threat\\" to the U.S. and said that its activities should not disrupt the daily lives of Americans. \\"Even as we are systematic and ruthless and focused in going after them ... it is very important for us to not respond with fear,\\" the president said. \\"We defeat them in part by saying, 'You are not strong. You are weak.' \\" ||||| REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado US President Barack Obama called out Ted Cruz, a Republican presidential candidate and Texas senator, for suggesting amped-up surveillance of Muslim neighborhoods in the US as a way to prevent terrorist attacks. Obama's remarks came Wednesday in a press conference during a visit to Argentina, a day after terrorists hit Belgium, killing at least 31 people and injuring more than 230 in bombings at a Brussels airport and metro station. The president emphasized that fighting the terrorist group ISIS — aka the Islamic State, ISIL, or Daesh — is his \\"top priority.\\" But he criticized Cruz for proposing what he termed a \\"counterproductive\\" strategy that might isolate American Muslims. Cruz said in a Tuesday statement that the police should be empowered to \\"patrol and secure\\" neighborhoods with large Muslim populations \\"before they become radicalized.\\" \\"I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighborhood surveillance, which, by the way, the father of Sen. Cruz escaped for America, the land of the free,\\" Obama said, referencing a historic visit to Cuba earlier in the week. He added: \\"The notion that we would start down that slippery slope makes absolutely no sense. It's contrary to who we are, and it's not going to help us to defeat ISIL.\\" Obama's visit to Cuba marked the first time in 88 years that a sitting US president traveled to the communist country. Cruz's father fled Cuba for the US in 1957. The president also criticized Cruz for saying that the US should \\"carpet bomb\\" ISIS in Iraq and Syria, a strategy that military experts have called ineffective and possibly illegal. \\"When I hear somebody saying we should 'carpet bomb' Iraq or Syria, not only is that inhumane, not only is that contrary to our values, but that would likely be an extraordinary mechanism for ISIL to recruit more people willing to die and explode bombs in an airport or in a metro station,\\" Obama said. \\"That's not a smart strategy.\\" Obama noted that what sets the US apart from Europe, which sees higher rates of foreign fighters traveling to join terrorist groups, is that Muslims are better integrated into American society. He said: One of the great strengths of the United States, and part of the reason why we have not seen more attacks in the United States, is we have an extraordinarily successful, patriotic, integrated Muslim-American community. They do not feel ghettoized, they do not feel isolated. Their children are our children's friends, going to the same schools. They are our colleagues in our workplaces. They are our men and women in uniform, fighting for our freedom. And so any approach that would single them out or target them for discrimination is not only wrong and un-American, but it also would be counterproductive. Because it would reduce the strength, the antibodies that we have to resist terrorism. President Obama answering questions during a joint news conference with Argentine President Mauricio Macri. AP Photo/Victor R. Caivano Obama also defended the US strategy for defeating ISIS, saying that the US's approach has been \\"continuously to adjust to see what works and what doesn't.\\" \\"What has been working is the air strikes that we're taking on their leadership, on their infrastructure, on their financial systems,\\" he said. \\"What has been working is special operators partnering with Iraqi security forces and going after leadership networks and couriers and disrupting the connection between their bases in Raqqa and their bases in Mosul,\\" he continued. But he acknowledged the challenges of identifying threats in Western countries. \\"It's challenging to find, identify very small groups of people who are willing to die themselves and can walk into a crowd and detonate a bomb,\\" Obama said. He continued: \\"And my charge to my team is to find every strategy possible to successfully reduce the risk of such terrorist attacks even after we go after their beating heart in places like Iraq and Syria.\\" ||||| President Obama joined the growing chorus Wednesday condemning Sen.

UPDATED:. 00:08 EST, 8 June 2012. Though most of Congress is likely looking forward to the summer recess, the Federal Reserve chairman offered a grim warning as the Bush-era tax cut expiration date looms. ‘If you all go on vacation,’ Ben Bernanke said, ‘(Taxmaggedon is) still going to happen, so it’s important to be thinking about that and working with your colleagues to see how you might address that concern at the appropriate time.’ He spoke urgently of the Bush-era tax cuts that will cost taxpayers 130billion in increases if nothing is done to extend them. Grim warning: Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke warned Congress Thursday to make a decision on the Bush-era tax cuts that are set to expire. Arms crossed: Bernanke is pictured before testifying at a Joint Economic Committee hearing on economic outlook and policy on Capitol Hill in Washington. Speaking at the Joint Economic Committee, Bernanke painted a grim warning. ‘If allowed to occur…(it would) pose a significant threat to the recovery,’ he said. ‘If no action were taken and the fiscal cliff were to kick in its full size, I think it would be very likely that the economy would being to contract or possibly go even into recession.’ He also added that unemployment would again rise from its current high at 8.2 per cent. However, he said the Fed is prepared to take steps to boost the U.S. economy if it weakens. But he said Fed officials still need to study the most recent economic trends, including job growth. For now, Bernanke said he foresees moderate growth this year. He said he's mindful that all that could change, if Europe's crisis quickly worsened or U.S. job growth stalled. 'As always, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to take action as needed to protect the U.S. financial system and economy in the event that financial stresses escalate,' he told the Joint Economic Committee. The Fed could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long-term interest rates, which might encourage more borrowing and spending. Or it could extend its plan to keep short-term rates near zero beyond late 2014 until an even later date. Don't let it happen: He said that the tax cuts cannot expire, as more unemployment and even another recession could result. But most economists don't expect a major announcement at the Fed's next policy meeting June 19-20, despite signals this week from some other Fed members in favour of considering further action. For one thing, long-term U.S. interest rates have already touched record lows. Even if rates dropped further, analysts say they might provide little benefit for the economy. ‘If allowed to occur (Taxmaggedon) would pose a. significant threat to the recovery. If no action were taken. and the fiscal cliff were to kick in its full size, I think it would be. very likely that the economy would being to contract or possibly go even. into recession.' They say it's unlikely that many businesses and consumers who aren't borrowing now at super-low rates would do so if rates declined a bit more. And Bernanke could face pressure not to pursue further stimulus before the November election because such steps could be perceived as helping President Barack Obama win re-election. 'The Fed simulative effects have really run their course,' Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, argued in a television interview last week. John Ryding and Conrad DeQuadros, economists at RDQ Economics, said there was nothing in the testimony to 'tip Bernanke's hand' before the June meeting of the Fed's policy committee. 'Yes, the Fed chairman said the Fed stands ready to act if Europe poses a threat to the U.S. financial system or the economy,' they wrote in a note to clients. 'However, he gave no specifics.' An early rally on Wall Street faded after Bernanke signalled no immediate further steps from the Fed to help the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average had been up as much as 140 points. It closed up about 46 points, or 0.3 per cent. Presiding: Bernanke presides over a meeting of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, from second left to right, Federal Reserve Board of Governors: Janet Yellen; Elizabeth Duke; Daniel Tarullo; Sarah Raskin; Jeremy Stein; Jerome Powell. Many analysts are worried that the U.S. economy is suffering a midyear slump just as in 2010 and 2011. They're concerned in particular about the job market. From December through February, the economy added an average 252,000 jobs a month. But since then, job growth has slowed to a lacklustre 96,000 a month. In May, U.S. employers added just 69,000 jobs - the fewest in a year. Bernanke said the Fed is still assessing the most recent employment data. Like many economists, Bernanke suggested that a warm winter might have prompted some hiring that normally would have occurred later. That could have weakened hiring temporarily in the spring. If that's true, hiring might bounce back. Still, Bernanke said some of the winter hiring might have made up for excessive job cuts during the recession. If so, and if those companies have completed such 'catch-up' hiring, then stronger economic growth might be needed to boost hiring, Bernanke said. 'That is the essential question we will have to look at,' he told the panel. The government said last week that the economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.9 per cent in the first three months of 2012. Paul Edelstein, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said he thought Bernanke didn't seem alarmed by the weak hiring in May. 'His view is that it isn't a sign that the economy is falling apart,' Edelstein said. Options: The Fed could buy more bonds to try to further reduce long-term interest rates, or it could extend its plan to keep short-term rates near zero beyond late 2014. Bernanke's message to financial markets, Edelstein said, was, 'Don't expect anything drastic from the Fed at the June meeting.' That said, if the Fed does announce some new action at its meeting later this month, Edelstein said the most likely step would be to extend a program, known as Operation Twist, that will expire at the end of June. Under Operation Twist, the Fed sells shorter-term securities and buys longer-term bonds. As with other Fed bond purchases, the idea has been to drive down long-term rates so that mortgages, auto loans and other consumer and business loans become more attractive. The Fed's policy committee has been split between those who favor doing everything possible to strengthen the economy and reduce unemployment, and those more concerned about inflation risks. On Wednesday, Janet Yellen, the vice chairman of the Fed, Dennis Lockhart, the head of the Atlanta regional Fed Bank, and John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed bank, all suggested that the Fed might need to do more to provide support. But Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, warned at Thursday's hearing against more bond buying. He and other critics worry that ever-lower borrowing rates could eventually ignite inflation. 'It is my belief that the Fed has done all that it can do and has perhaps done too much,' said Brady, vice chairman of the committee. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Second question: Does GPA matter for an entry level software position at a great company? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First Question: Does GPA matter for a CS student who wants to work at a tech company? GPA, or Grade Point Average, is a measure of a student's academic performance. It can be an important factor for a Computer Science student who wants to work at a tech company, but it is not the only consideration. There are several aspects to consider on the subject. While a high GPA is generally regarded as an indication of a student's proficiency in their field of study, tech companies often look for more than just good grades when evaluating potential employees. They also consider the technical and soft skills, project experience, internships, and extra-curricular activities that shape a well-rounded candidate. Having a good GPA can give you an edge in securing interviews, especially with large and reputable tech companies, as they tend to employ strict filters when examining the plethora of applications received. However, smaller and more flexible companies might be more inclined to look past the numbers and focus on a candidate's skills and potential instead. In addition to GPA, companies like to see that a candidate has practical experience working on real-world projects, either independently or as part of a team. This experience can come from internships, freelance work, or personal projects that demonstrate your proficiency in particular programming languages or tools. Soft skills are also crucial, as they play a significant role in teamwork, problem-solving, and communication. Moreover, participating in hackathons, coding competitions, and open-source projects can help showcase your expertise and dedication outside the classroom. In summary, although GPA can be an important factor when applying for a job at a tech company, it is not the sole determinant. Technical and soft skills, project experience, internships, and extra-curricular activities are just as important in presenting yourself as a desirable candidate. Second Question: Does GPA matter for an entry-level software position at a great company? When pursuing an entry-level software position at a well-regarded company, having a good GPA can be beneficial, but it is not the only consideration. Companies generally look at a combination of factors and qualities that contribute to the candidate’s overall suitability for the role. As in the previous response, factors such as technical and soft skills, project experience, internships, and extra-curricular activities play crucial roles in hiring decisions. Larger and prestigious companies often have GPA cut-offs to manage the volume of applications they receive. In this case, having a good GPA can help to secure an interview or get your foot in the door. However, it is essential not to solely rely on your GPA – working on your other skills and experiences can make a significant difference in your job prospects. Smaller companies or start-ups are more likely to value hands-on experience, adaptability, and technical know-how over a high GPA. Demonstrating project management, collaboration, communication, and problem-solving skills through internships, freelance work, personal projects, or open-source contributions can help you stand out in the eyes of potential employers. Comparing the two questions: While these two questions have subtle differences in context and focus, they are, in essence, asking the same thing: How important is GPA when seeking a position within the technology sector? Both questions emphasize the desire to work either at a tech company or in an entry-level software role at a reputable company. In both cases, the answer remains that GPA holds a certain degree of importance, but it is not the sole factor affecting hiring decisions. Technical and soft skills, hands-on experience, internships, and extra-curricular participation are equally crucial in presenting yourself as a strong candidate. It is essential to strike a balance between academic performance and practical experience, ensuring you gain the competencies that employers are looking for."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This development comes after weeks of escalating tensions and violent confrontations in the area. Step 1: Establish the context The announcement of the cease-fire brings a temporary halt to the exchange of gunfire between Palestinian militants and Israeli soldiers that has terrorized the town's residents for several weeks. Numerous casualties have been reported on both sides amid growing concerns of a further escalation of the conflict. Step 2: Describe the cease-fire agreement The cease-fire agreement, facilitated by international mediators, outlines a framework wherein both sides agree to halt their hostility and refrain from any offensive action. In return, Palestinian authorities promise to prevent militants' attacks on Israel, while Israel agrees to halt its military operations around the town. Step 3: Highlight the significance of the agreement The Beit Jalla cease-fire marks a critical milestone in the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The negotiation process signals a willingness from both parties to engage in a peaceful resolution despite the immense challenges they have faced thus far. This agreement is an essential first step towards establishing a longer-lasting peace in the region. Step 4: Discuss potential challenges While the cease-fire brings much-needed respite for the residents of Beit Jalla, upholding the agreement depends on both sides' commitment to maintain the terms put forth. Possible obstacles include rogue militants who might not abide by the cease-fire and the risk of either party retaliating if provoked. Step 5: Conclude Despite potential challenges, the confirmation of the Beit Jalla cease-fire agreement by Shimon Peres offers a glimmer of hope in the conflict-ridden region. It is crucial for both Israelis and Palestinians to work together and adhere to the agreement terms to pave the way towards a sustainable peace in this volatile area."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - skin - membrane - nerves - immunity A: Answer:","completion":"To find the correct answer, first, we need to understand the options given and the meanings of the terms. Then, determine which option aligns with natural immunity acquired passively. 1. Think about each choice: - Skin: the barrier to pathogens, providing physical protection against infection. - Membrane: biological barriers that could prevent pathogens from entering the body. - Nerves: a part of the nervous system responsible for transmitting messages, not directly related to immunity. - Immunity: the body's defense against pathogens. 2. Define terms: - Natural immunity: immunity one is born with or develops naturally without medical intervention. - Acquired passively: immunity obtained without the person's immune system actively generating a response, e.g., through the transfer of antibodies. 3. Analyze the choices: - Skin and membranes could be considered as examples of natural immunity, but they are not passively acquired since they are part of our innate immune system. - Nerves are unrelated to immunity, so they don't fit the description. - Immunity is the general term for the body's defense against pathogens, which encompasses both innate and adaptive immunity. As none of the provided choices align with the concept of natural immunity acquired passively, analyzing the context of the question, it is reasonable to assume that there might be a small error in the given alternatives.

Given the question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Given the fact \\"an animal needs to eat food for nutrients\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"Which of these things will supplement a squirrel's caloric needs?\\" Select from the following. I. fish; II. tree bark; III. nuts; IV. leaves;","completion":"A squirrel's diet typically consists of a variety of plants, including nuts, seeds, conifer cones, fruits, fungi, and green vegetation. However, squirrels are versatile animals, and their diet varies significantly depending on their environment. I. Fish - While it's not impossible for a squirrel to eat fish, particularly if nothing else is available, it's highly unlikely. Squirrels are not effective predators of mobile, aware prey like fish. Additionally, their digestive systems are not designed to process meat effectively. The way a squirrel's teeth are designed makes it difficult for them to consume and digest meat or fish. II. Tree Bark - Squirrels are known to strip tree bark, particularly in the winter when other food sources are scarce. Certain tree bark can be a source of nutrition, but a squirrel cannot survive on bark alone. Plus, eating too much bark can be damaging to a squirrel's teeth. III. Nuts - This is the primary and favorite food source for many squirrels. They have a particular liking for walnuts, hickory nuts, and acorns. Nuts are a rich source of proteins, vitamins, essential oils, and help in the growth and development of squirrels. Almonds and hazelnuts are rich in protein and fat and help the squirrel to maintain its body temperate in the harsh winter season. That extra fat layer is vital to their survival during the colder months when food is scarce. Nuts are also efficient calorie sources for squirrels, as they are both energy-dense and readily available in many environments where squirrels live. IV. Leaves - Leaves offer little in the way of nutrition or caloric content for most herbivores, including squirrels. However, some squirrels would consume leaves, primarily if other food options are scarce. They would be a far less efficient food source than nuts or seeds, though. So among the options given, nuts (III) are the most suitable to supplement a squirrel's caloric needs. Nuts provide the high-energy, nutrient-dense food source that squirrels require for their active lifestyle. While tree bark (II) and leaves (IV) might occasionally be part of a squirrel's diet, they are not as nutritious or energy-dense as nuts. Fish (I), on the other hand, is not a typical part of a squirrel's diet and wouldn't likely provide the type of nutrients a squirrel needs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Story: Jordan was planning on moving to Mexico. Jordan decided that he should learn Spanish. He ended up purchasing a language learning program from Amazon. Everyday he worked on the program for at least 2 hours. What happened next?","completion":"As the days went by, Jordan's confidence in speaking and understanding Spanish began to grow. His dedication to the language learning program and commitment to practicing for at least two hours daily soon started to show results. He diligently followed the program and made it a point not to miss any sessions. Feeling motivated by his progress, he expanded his learning techniques even further. Realizing that immersion in the language was crucial for his success, Jordan started looking for opportunities to practice his Spanish outside of the online program. He researched local language institutes and found a nearby Spanish-speaking meetup group that he could join. At these meetups, Jordan met other Spanish learners as well as native speakers who were eager to share their language and culture with him. Together, they engaged in conversation, played games, and participated in activities related to the Spanish language. The more Jordan progressed with his studies, the stronger his desire to connect with Spanish-speaking individuals both offline and online grew. He ventured into Spanish forums and started watching movies and shows in the language with the purpose of improving his listening comprehension skills. At first, he watched with subtitles to make it easier to understand the content. As time passed and his skills improved, he eventually began watching without subtitles – a true testament to his enhanced language abilities. To complement his online program and come as close as possible to native-level fluency, Jordan even started reading books, newspapers, and magazines in Spanish. These resources helped expand his vocabulary and offered valuable insights into the culture of Mexico and other Spanish-speaking countries. As the months went by and his departure to Mexico approached, Jordan felt increasingly ready for the big move. He began looking for a place to live and researching the best options for work and necessities. Armed with newfound knowledge about the culture and a solid grasp of the language, he was able to secure a great job opportunity that aligned with his skills and interests. Finally, the day came when Jordan boarded his flight to Mexico. As he stepped off the plane and into his new life, he was filled with excitement and anticipation. His hard work and commitment to learning Spanish had well prepared him for this moment – the beginning of an amazing adventure in a new country. Throughout his time in Mexico, Jordan continued to polish his Spanish skills, forming deep connections with the locals and embracing their customs wholeheartedly. He actively participated in the community, attending events and gatherings with his newfound friends. As he integrated into the Mexican way of life, Jordan found that the hours he had spent investing in learning the language were not only useful but also essential for a fulfilling and successful life in his adopted country. His dedication to learning Spanish paved the way for both personal and professional growth. In the end, Jordan's journey to Mexico and the decision to learn Spanish proved to be a life-changing experience.

First question: Is cheating ever acceptable? Second question: Can you ever justify cheating? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"To answer both questions, let's break down each question individually and determine the similarities and differences in their meanings. Question 1: Is cheating ever acceptable? This question asks whether there are conditions or situations where cheating may be considered tolerable or permissible. Step 1: Define cheating in its broadest sense. Cheating is acting dishonestly or unfairly to gain an advantage. Step 2: Consider different contexts in which cheating could occur (academic, personal relationships, sports, etc.). Step 3: Analyze whether there may be instances where cheating, despite its negative connotation, could be deemed acceptable by some people or according to certain moral, ethical, or philosophical viewpoints. Question 2: Can you ever justify cheating? This question asks whether there are circumstances or reasons that can be used to defend or vindicate cheating. Step 1: Identify reasons or arguments one might make to justify cheating (e.g., survival, self-defense, greater good). Step 2: Consider if these reasons are morally or ethically valid under various moral and ethical frameworks. Step 3: Reflect on the potential consequences or risks of cheating in different situations, weighing the justification provided against the potential harm and overall outcome. Comparing the two questions, we can see that they are asking similar but slightly different things. The first question is focused on the acceptability of cheating, whereas the second question is focused on providing reasoning or justification for cheating. Both questions probe the moral and ethical boundaries around cheating, but the first question is more focused on overall perception, while the second question is examining the rationale behind a specific instance of cheating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Expose is an American Latin freestyle vocal group. Primarily consisting of lead vocalists Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless, and Gioia Bruno, the group achieved much of their success between 1984 and 1993, becoming the first group to have four top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from its debut album, including the 1988 #1 hit \\"Seasons Change\\". In March 2015, Billboard magazine named the group the eighth most-successful girl group of all-time. The group was popular in dance clubs, mainstream Top 40 and adult contemporary charts in the United States. During the recording of the group's first studio album Exposure, the personnel of the group changed. Reports vary based on the source. According to People magazine, one of the original singers quit while two of the girls were fired midway through the recording of the first album, but according to Billboard, all three were fired. Arista records felt that the three original singers lacked star potential. Martinee states that he made the decision himself to replace the three girls, while Miller maintains it was all their choice, and Jurado confirms that Lorenzo wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, Casanas pursued a solo career and Lorenzo pursued other ambitions; they were replaced by Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno. Miller began a solo career; she was replaced by Ann Curless. Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with the Vendetta Records releases \\"I Wanna Know\\" in 1988, and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love\\" in 1990, while Laurie Miller released the 12\\" single \\"Parallels\\" on Atlantic Records and a second single \\"Love is a Natural Magical Thing\\" on Meet Me In Miami Records. Laurie evolved into a headline performer frequently showcasing her talents on cruises with a more intimate jazz style, and formed her own entertainment company called Xica productions. Casanas later resurfaced as a solo artist (Sandee) and released a solo album, Only Time Will Tell, which garnered the club hits \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\", and the Clivilles & Cole-produced bassline-heavy hit \\"Notice Me\\". She continued to tour actively in dance clubs and freestyle shows, until her death on December 15, 2008, of a seizure at the age of 46. All three original members: Casanas, Lorenzo and Miller later contributed vocals on songs on the Miami group Will to Power's eponymous 1988 debut album.

Kaiser Chiefs are an English indie rock band from Leeds who formed in 2000 as Parva, releasing one studio album, 22, in 2003, before renaming and establishing themselves in their current name that same year. Since their formation the band consists of lead vocalist Ricky Wilson, guitarist Andrew \\"Whitey\\" White, bassist Simon Rix, keyboardist and occasional drummer Nick \\"Peanut\\" Baines and since 2013 drummer Vijay Mistry, who replaced founding drummer Nick Hodgson who left the band in late 2012. Primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s, the band have released six original studio albums: Employment (2005), Yours Truly, Angry Mob (2007), Off with Their Heads (2008) When they were around eleven years old, Nick Hodgson, Nick Baines and Simon Rix met in the same class at St. Mary's Catholic High School, Menston, West Yorkshire. After leaving school, Rix and Baines left for university in 1996 whereas Hodgson remained in the Leeds area, meeting both Andrew White and Ricky Wilson. Hodgson, White and Wilson formed the band Runston Parva, its name a deliberate misspelling of a small East Yorkshire hamlet called Ruston Parva. After Runston Parva failed to secure a record deal, the group re-formed as Parva upon the return of Rix and Baines from university. Parva's career went beyond the boundaries of Leeds, and the band was able to obtain both a record and publishing deal. However, after Beggars Banquet closed the Mantra label, Parva were dropped and left desolate and without any direction after the release of an album (22) and three singles (\\"Heavy\\", \\"Good Bad Right Wrong\\" and \\"Hessles\\"). According to manager James Sandom in an interview with HitQuarters, as a dropped band they had become damaged goods, \\"No one would touch them because they had a history. A lot of people used their history against them.\\" The band decided that they would aim for a longer term record deal and started afresh with new songs and a new name: Kaiser Chiefs. The new name was taken from South African football club Kaizer Chiefs, the first club of ex-Leeds United captain Lucas Radebe. Manager James Sandom was tipped off about the band by Drowned in Sound founder Sean Adams and persuaded him to go and see them live. Sandom said: \\"I went to see a couple of shows and you were just bombarded by a series of potential hit singles.\\" Soon after Sandom became their manager, Kaiser Chiefs signed to B-Unique Records. Atlantic Records had also made an offer for the band. In July 2004, while still relatively unknown inside the UK, Kaiser Chiefs performed their first festival outside the UK at a festival in Moscow. One of the major factors in the band's breakthrough in 2005 was their involvement in the NME Awards Tour at the beginning of the year. Like Coldplay and Franz Ferdinand before them, their position as opening act proved an influential one, attracting a lot of positive media attention. The group's debut album Employment was released in March 2005, being primarily inspired by new wave and punk rock music of the late 1970s and 1980s. The album was well received by music critics, described as \\"thrilling from beginning to end\\" and \\"quintessentially British, without pretension and most importantly, a whole lot of fun\\". It reached number two on the UK albums chart, and was certified five times platinum. In 2005, Employment was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, an annual music prize awarded for the best British or Irish album from the previous year. Bookmakers made it favourite to win the award, but they eventually lost out to Antony and the Johnsons. In 2006, Employment won the Ivor Novello award for 'Best Album' The first single released from the album was \\"Oh My God\\" in 2004, which reached number six on the UK singles chart when it was reissued in February 2005. In 2007, the song was covered by Mark Ronson and Lily Allen for Ronson's album Version. \\"I Predict a Riot\\" soon followed as the album's second release. In 2007, the song was ranked number thirty-six on the NME \\"Greatest Indie Anthems Ever\\" countdown. The top twenty singles \\"Everyday I Love You Less and Less\\" and \\"Modern Way\\" followed in late 2005. The band opened and performed several of their singles at the Philadelphia Live Eight concert in 2005. The song \\"Saturday Night\\" was featured in a pre-release video for the Xbox 360 gaming console. It was posted on the official Xbox 360 page before its launch. In 2006, the band received NME awards for 'Best Album' for Employment and 'Best Dressed' for Ricky Wilson. On 4 August 2008, the band confirmed the name of their third album as Off with Their Heads. It was released on 20 October 2008. The first single \\"Never Miss a Beat\\" was released on 6 October 2008. The band also released a DVD of their live performance at Elland Road from 24 May where they played to a sold out capacity crowd of 40,000 people. The DVD contains the full set from the home of Leeds United as well as highlights from the Kaiser Chiefs performance for the 2007 BBC Electric Proms. Kaiser Chiefs set out on a UK tour in October 2008 with Castle Donington band Late of the Pier and The Hair. The tour started at Leeds Academy, a new venue where they were the first headlining band to play. Other dates included Manchester Academy, Southampton Guildhall, Reading Rivermead, Glasgow Barrowlands, Leicester De Montfort Hall and London Forum. Kaiser Chiefs headed out on a UK Arena tour between February and March 2009, kicking off in Nottingham and ending in London. The tour visited Sheffield, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Newcastle, Manchester, Liverpool, Cardiff and Dublin. This was the new album tour to promote Off with Their Heads. The band featured on several shows over Christmas 2008 including performing \\"Never Miss a Beat\\" with Girls Aloud on their TV Special and playing the same song on the Christmas Day edition of Top of the Pops. On 16 July 2009, they played at Mares Vivas in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal as headliners on that day. They, along with Republic of Loose, opened for U2 in Croke Park in Dublin on 25 July 2009.

Based on the premise \\"While it would be a crime to ignore the churches, palazzos, and museums chronicling the unparalleled glories of Italy's history, the best way to enjoy them is also to spend plenty of time soaking it in from a front-row seat in a cafe, or from under a canvas beach umbrella watching seaside life unfold.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Taking in the sights by observing the locals will tell you what Italy is really like.\\" is true?","completion":"Yes, one possible interpretation of the premise provided could lead to the conclusion that \\"Taking in the sights by observing the locals will tell you what Italy is really like.\\" is true. However, let's discuss this in greater detail to fully understand how we can arrive at this conclusion. The premise opens with the acknowledgment of Italy's rich historical heritage, mentioning aspects such as the church, palazzos, and museums that create a compelling portrayal of the country's past. This part suggests that visiting these places, absorbing the history, art, and culture they represent, is crucial to understanding Italy. And while ignoring these would be considered a \\"crime,\\" it does not mean that it is the only way to learn about Italy. On the contrary, the premise suggests that a complementary - if not equally important – method of experiencing the Italian cultural landscape is embodied in spending time amid the daily life of its citizens. This is where the recommendations of spending time in cafes and watching life unfold on the beach come in. These settings are often less formal and more relaxed, allowing tourists to absorb the Italian way of life in a much more personal and close-to-life manner. Soaking in the atmosphere, listening to the hum of Italian conversations, watching the everyday interactions between people - all this provides insight into the local mindset, traditions, and social norms. From these observations, one can glean the nuances of the Italian lifestyle, which museums and monuments might not wholly capture. The character, rhythm, and pulse of a city are reflected not only in its static monuments but also in its dynamic citizens, whose daily life paint a vivid representation of what the place is \\"really like\\". Therefore, observing locals and partaking in everyday Italian activities isn't just a useful supplement to visiting historical sites; it's a crucial part of indulging in and understanding the nation's unique identity. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"taking in the sights by observing the locals will tell you what Italy is really like\\" can be seen as a valid extension of the given premise. It indicates that there is a live, vibrant, and evolving side of Italy living concurrently with its historical persona, best understood by becoming part of it, even if temporarily.

Retinerea unor imagini si mesaje puternice din ceea ce vedem şi auzim este o parte naturală a procesului percepţiei umane. Din momentul in care deschidem ochii sau ascultam ceva, creierul nostru prelucrează informațiile primite și decide ce informații să păstreze și ce informații să elimine. Acest proces este influențat de diferiți factori, cum ar fi atenția noastră, emoțiile, experiențele anterioare și importanța informațiilor. Dacă o anumită imagine sau un anumit mesaj ne impresionează profund, suntem predispuși să le reținem mai ușor pentru a le utiliza ulterior în diverse circumstanțe. Imaginile și mesajele impresionante sunt, de obicei, încărcate cu emoții puternice - precum fericire, tristețe sau furie - și pot conține un element surprinzător sau neobișnuit, care atrage și menține atenția noastră. Spre exemplu, o reclama care prezintă un peisaj uluitor sau o situație de viață în care se transmite un mesaj emoționant, ne poate rămâne în minte mult timp după ce am văzut-o. Memorarea acestor imagini și mesaje ne poate ajuta să învățăm lucruri noi, să ne formăm opinii și să ne adaptăm comportamentul în funcție de diferite situații.

Jackson) promoting his two brands -- the \\"Booty Sweat\\" energy drink and \\"Bust-A-Nut\\" candy bar -- while performing his hit song, \\"I Love Tha' Pussy.\\" The first trailer shows action star Tugg Speedman's (Ben Stiller) latest film, Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, a film so much like its five predecessors that even the trailer narrator sounds shaky about it. In another trailer, funnyman Jeff \\"Fatty\\" Portnoy (Jack Black) plays every member of \\"America's favorite obese family\\" in the highly flatulent The Fatties: Fart 2. The final trailer, for a film called Satan's Alley, features Australian \\"five-time Oscar winner\\" Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and Tobey Maguire (as himself) as two monks who begin an impassioned affair.We are taken, via the narration of John \\"Four Leaf\\" Tayback (Nick Nolte), into a gruesome battle of the Vietnam War. This is actually a scene from Tropic Thunder, a big-budget adaptation of Tayback's wartime memoir. Starring as the central platoon are Speedman, Lazarus, Chino and Portnoy, as well as young character actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). To play the role of Sgt. Lincoln Osiris, an African American, Lazarus has dyed his skin dark and refuses to break character. (\\"I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.\\") A take of Osiris crying over Tayback's (Speedman's) blown-off hands is ruined when Speedman is unable to cry and Lazarus dribbles uncontrollably into Speedman's face.

Answer:","completion":"The crew gets footage for the film Tropic Thunder by employing standard filmmaking techniques, such as using multiple cameras, lights, and staging scenes with actors and extras. The film is primarily shot on location in jungle settings, which helps create authenticity and realism. The director, Damien Cockburn, guides the actors through their scenes, while working with a crew of cinematographers, sound technicians, and other specialists to capture the necessary footage. Additionally, the movie incorporates mock trailers and commercials within its narrative, which are filmed and edited in the style of real advertisements and movie trailers to enhance the satire and spoof elements of the film. Tropic Thunder is a metatextual comedy, which means that it not only portrays the storyline of the actors' misadventures in the wilderness, but also pokes fun at the Hollywood filmmaking process. As a result, much of the crew's footage is meant to capture both the humor and tension among the characters, as well as to satirize the conventions and excesses of the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oatmeal is also added to the bulk of your bread..","completion":"Instead of white bread, you can try using whole wheat bread for a healthier alternative. Although it may not be as traditional as white bread, whole wheat bread offers more nutritional value and can be a good choice if you want to add a twist to the classic fairy bread recipe. If you'd like to maintain the authenticity of the original recipe, feel free to try other options like strawberry shortcake cream bread, scones, and popcorn squares, which are commonly made with white bread. Be sure to pick your bread based on your taste preference and the type of event you are making the fairy bread for. When preparing the fairy bread, decide whether you want to leave the crust on or not. For children's parties or picky eaters, removing the crust may be beneficial. However, if you prefer a more rustic touch and added texture, feel free to keep the crust on. This choice is down to your personal preference and the preferences of your guests. Now, if you'd like to experiment with the shape of your loaf, you can try repeating the bread recipe over and over again to achieve a round loaf. Adding oatmeal to the bulk of your bread can also yield an unique texture and give a different spin to your fairy bread recipe. After selecting and preparing the bread of your choice, follow these simple steps to make the perfect fairy bread: 1. Soften butter: Let some butter reach room temperature so that it’s easily spreadable. This will prevent the bread from tearing during the spreading process. 2. Spread butter: Generously spread the softened butter on one side of each slice of bread. Make sure to cover the entire surface, as the butter acts as a glue for the sprinkles. 3. Add sprinkles: Pour rainbow-colored sprinkles or nonpareils onto a plate. Gently press the buttered side of the bread into the sprinkles, making sure that they stick evenly and completely cover the surface. You may also opt for different colored sprinkles, depending on the theme of your event or to match personal preferences. 4. Cut into shapes: Using a knife or cookie cutters, cut the fairy bread into triangles, squares, rectangles, or fun shapes like hearts and stars. Smaller, bite-sized shapes work best for parties and easy snacking. 5. Arrange and serve: Place the fairy bread pieces on a serving platter or tray, creating a colorful and enticing display. Serve immediately or store in an airtight container for a short period to maintain freshness. Enjoy your homemade fairy bread, a delightful and whimsical treat that is sure to bring smiles to everyone's faces, regardless of age!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A woman urinates on the grass by the side of the road. She then pulls up her underwear and enters the nearby car, where her husband is waiting for her. Then they drive away. The couple have lost their way in the night, and subsequently run off the side of the road. The next scene occurs in daytime, and depicts their corpses. The man has lost an eyeball, but remains inside the vehicle. While the woman was thrown off the vehicle, and her body was cut in two pieces.[4] The film centers on Rob Schmadtke, the tragic hero, who works for \\"Joe's Cleaning Agency\\", a company that removes bodies from public areas. They clean up the mess after traffic collisions. Their emblem is the Totenkopf symbol (skull and crossbones variant) within a pentagram.[4][5] This job leaves him the perfect opportunity to pursue his full-time hobby: necrophilia. He returns home from his job to his apartment and girlfriend, Betty. He plays with his assortment of preserved human remains and watches television while Betty takes a bath in blood-laden water. Their apartment is decorated with centerfolds featuring models, pictures of famed killers, and jars containing human parts, which are preserved in formaldehyde.[4] Rob watches a televised interview of a psychiatrist, speaking on the topic of arachnophobia and ways to overcome phobias.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided movie plot, a suitable question to generate might be: How does Rob Schmadtke's traumatic childhood experiences and exposure to death and violence through his job at \\"Joe's Cleaning Agency\\" contribute to the development of his disturbing behavior and necrophilia, and what is the significance of the seemingly unrelated scene featuring a man accidentally killing a gardener in understanding Rob's character and the overall narrative of the film? In this question, we address several critical aspects of the film, including the protagonist's mental state, the influence of his past and job, and the potential symbolism in the seemingly unrelated character's actions. To answer this question, we can delve into the effects of Rob Schmadtke's childhood trauma and his work at the cleaning agency. The film establishes a connection between his fascination with death and his past, as evidenced by his daydream of a childhood pet being brutally killed - presumably a memory from his past, which implies that exposure to violence has been a part of Rob's life since he was young. This connection is further strengthened by the subsequent memory of witnessing a human autopsy, indicating that death fascinates Rob just as much as it traumatizes him. Similarly, Rob's job at \\"Joe's Cleaning Agency\\" exposes him to death and violence regularly, albeit with a different context. The fact that his job allows him to engage in his necrophilia hobby underscores how his work only serves to feed his twisted desires. This idea is reinforced by his home decorated with killer's memorabilia and human body parts, exhibiting the extent of his obsession with death. Regarding the seemingly unrelated scene involving a man accidentally killing a gardener, its significance could be twofold. Firstly, it might symbolize how seemingly normal individuals can also be capable of causing harm or engaging in violence – thus, drawing a parallel between Rob and this character. Additionally, it confirms the thematic preoccupation with death and violence in the movie. Secondly, since the gardener's corpse becomes Rob's new obsession, the scene acts as a catalyst for the film's primary conflict or turning point, directly impacting Rob's character development and the unfolding events. In conclusion, Rob Schmadtke's dark past, his job at the cleaning agency, and the film's rampant symbolic violence all contribute to his character's disturbing nature. Furthermore, the seemingly unrelated scene with the accidental killing of a gardener serves as both a thematic reinforcement and a direct influence on Rob's actions within the film's narrative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She was the eldest of four children of William Mickle Paul I (1850-1902) and Tacie Paul (nee Parry), and a descendant of William Penn, the Quaker founder of Pennsylvania. Her siblings were Willam, Helen, and Parry. She grew up in the Quaker tradition of public service; her ancestors included participants in the New Jersey Committee of Correspondence in the Revolutionary era and a state legislative leader in the 19th century. Context: In the US presidential election of 1916, Paul and the NWP campaigned in western states where women could already vote against the continuing refusal of President Woodrow Wilson and other incumbent Democrats to actively support the Suffrage Amendment. In January 1917, the NWP staged the first political protest and picketing at the White House. The pickets, participating in a nonviolent civil disobedience campaign known as the \\"Silent Sentinels,\\" held banners demanding the right to vote. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, many people viewed the picketing Silent Sentinels as disloyal. In June 1917, picketers were arrested on charges of \\"obstructing traffic.\\" Over the next six months, many, including Alice, were convicted and incarcerated at the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia (which later became the Lorton Correctional Complex) and the District of Columbia Jail. When the public heard the news of the first arrests some were surprised that leading suffragists and very well-connected women were going to prison for peacefully protesting. President Wilson received bad publicity from this event, and was livid with the position he was forced into. He quickly pardoned the first women arrested on July 19, two days after they had been sentenced, but reporting on the arrests and abuses continued. The Boston Journal, for example, stated, \\"The little band representing the NWP has been abused and bruised by government clerks, soldiers and sailors until its efforts to attract the President's attention has sunk into the conscience of the whole nation.\\" Suffragists continued picketing outside the White House after the Wilson pardon, and throughout World War I. Their banners contained such slogans as \\"Mr. President, How Long Must Women Wait For Liberty?\\". Although the suffragists protested peacefully, their protests were sometimes violently opposed. While protesting, young men would harass and beat the women, with the police never intervening on behalf of the protesters. Police would even arrest other men who tried to help the women who were getting beaten. Even though they were protesting during wartime, they maintained public support by agitating peacefully. Throughout this time, more protesters were arrested and sent to Occoquan or the District Jail. Pardons were no longer offered. Question: what was her biggest accomplishment?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Alice Paul's biggest accomplishment was her instrumental role in the passage of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted women the right to vote. As a suffragist, feminist, and women's rights activist, Paul dedicated her life to the fight for gender equality. As the leader of the National Woman's Party (NWP) in the early 20th century, she played a crucial role in organizing and orchestrating protests and demonstrations that raised public awareness and garnered national attention for the suffrage movement. This included her decision to organize the Silent Sentinels, who picketed outside of the White House to demand voting rights for women and placed continuous pressure on President Woodrow Wilson to act. Alice Paul's persistence, courage, and creative tactics, despite being faced with arrests, imprisonment, and violence, directly contributed to the eventual passage of the 19th Amendment on August 18, 1920. This historic amendment not only recognized women's right to vote but also laid the groundwork for subsequent efforts to advance women's rights and gender equality in the United States. Alice Paul's lasting impact can be observed through her relentless activism on behalf of women and her role in one of the most significant milestones in the American women's rights movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Where did the mascot of Notre Dame first appear? Context: Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W. Drake in 1964, the leprechaun was first used on the football pocket schedule and later on the football program covers. The leprechaun was featured on the cover of Time in November 1964 and gained national exposure.

Nader Shah dreamed of an empire which would stretch from the Indus to the Bosphorus. Therefore he raised an army of 200,000, which consisted largely of rebellious Central Asian tribesmen, and he planned to march towards Constantinople, but after he learned that the Ottoman ulema was preparing for a holy war against Persia, he turned eastward. He captured Kirkuk, Arbil and besieged Mosul on 14 September 1743. The siege lasted for 40 days. The Pasha of Mosul, Hajji Hossein Al Jalili, successfully defended Mosul and Nader Shah was forced to retreat. The offensive was halted due to revolts in Persia over high taxes. Hostilities also spilled into Georgia, where Prince Givi Amilakhvari employed an Ottoman force in a futile attempt to undermine the Persian influence and dislodge Nader's Georgian allies, Princes Teimuraz and Erekle.

Review: I can't believe that so many are comparing this movie to Argento's. His work is far more imaginative and vicious--and a lot more fun. The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension. The murder scenes--and let's face it, that's what this genre is all about--aren't interesting. It was not hard to guess who the murderer was, and I really didn't care when it was revealed. The cinematography isn't memorable, and the much-praised 19th century Gothic atmosphere just didn't draw me in. Several of the actors are quite good (especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students), but they're given very little to do.

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer is: Pele is the goddess of volcanoes in Hawaiian mythology. Pele, also known as Pelehonuamea, is revered as the powerful and passionate goddess of fire, lightning, wind, and volcanoes in the ancient Hawaiian religion. Pele is part of a large family of gods and goddesses, known as the Pele family, that play a significant role in Hawaiian spiritual practices and the forces of nature that are present in the islands. According to legend, Pele was born in the land of Kuaihelani, a far-off mythical land, and she traveled across the ocean with her sister Hi'iaka and brother Kamohoali'i, in search of a new home, eventually settling in Hawaii. Accounts of Pele's origin and relationships among her relatives vary, but she is prominent in Hawaiian folklore and is commonly known as Ka wahine 'ai honua (\\"the woman who devours the land\\") due to her volcanic eruptions and the destructive nature of her powers. Pele is said to reside in Halema'uma'u crater located at the summit of Kīlauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes on Hawai'i Island. This particular volcano is one of five that make up the island of Hawai'i, also known as the Big Island, and is considered sacred by native Hawaiians due to its connection with Pele. Hawaiian chants and oral history contain numerous tales about Pele and her exploits, which often portray her as a fiery, passionate, and volatile figure. These tales often depict her as having a dynamic character that embodies many emotions, such as love, jealousy, anger, and grief. In addition to being the creator of the beautiful Hawaiian landscape, Pele is also thought to be responsible for both the destructive aspects of volcanic eruptions and the regenerative aspects of volcanic activity, as new earth is created from her molten lava flows. Today, Pele continues to be an essential figure in Hawaiian culture and is respected by many native Hawaiians and residents of the islands. Her influence can be seen in various art forms, from hula dancing to traditional chants, which celebrate and honor the powerful goddess. In contemporary times, the name \\"Pele\\" is also given to unusual volcanic phenomena or physical manifestations such as Pele's hair, delicate strands of volcanic glass formed by lava fountains, and Pele's tears, small solidified droplets of lava. Thus, Pele is the goddess of volcanoes in Hawaiian mythology and plays a prominent role in the culture and spiritual practices of the Hawaiian people."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Anti-Flag are an American punk rock band from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The band is well known for politically charged lyrics and activism, focusing on anti-war activism, anti-imperialism, class struggle, human rights, and various sociopolitical sentiments. The line-up includes singer/guitarist Justin Sane and drummer Pat Thetic, who founded the band; later members are guitarist Chris Head, and singer/bassist Chris Barker (#2) who replaced Jamie \\"Cock\\" Towns, who had replaced original bassist Andy Flag in 1997 following his departure one year prior. Anti-Flag is known also for their advocacy of progressive political action groups such as Greenpeace and Amnesty International. In 1996, the band released their first album, Die For the Government, on New Red Archives. Andy Flag left the band in the summer of 1996 because of personal disputes between himself and Justin. For a brief time after Andy's departure in 1996, Sean Whelan of Pittsburgh band the Bad Genes filled in on bass. It was during this time that Sean was also playing in another band (57 Defective) with guitarist Chris Head, whom he introduced to the band. In early 1997, Pittsburgh guitarist Chris Head began filling in on bass. In late 1997, Jamie Cock took over as the new bassist, moving Chris Head over to second guitar, which he preferred. The current line-up finalized in 1999 when Chris Barker, also known as Chris No. 2, replaced Jamie Cock on bass. In 1998, the band released their second full-length release, Their System Doesn't Work For You. The album contained all nine Anti-Flag songs from the 1996 Anti-Flag/d.b.s. split album North America Sucks, as well as 10 new unreleased songs. The band decided to release the album independently, and Their System Doesn't Work For You became the debut release for the band's own A-F Records. In 1999, Anti-Flag released the album A New Kind of Army on Go-Kart Records/A-F Records. The album addressed topics such as abortion, political corruption, racism, fascism, troubled youth, police brutality, and unity within the American youth. The cover art page unfolded into a poster featuring the phrase \\"Too smart to fight. Too smart to kill. Join now.

The 1992 Local Government Act, which was enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, was responsible for the reorganization of local government on that date. Under this legislation, extensive changes were made to the administrative structures within England and Wales. The 1992 Local Government Act established a new system of unitary authorities, which were designed to simplify and streamline local government by providing a single tier of local administration responsible for all local government functions within their areas. This replaced the previous two-tier system that had been in place, consisting of county councils and district councils. In the specific example mentioned in the statement, the city referenced became administratively independent from Hampshire County as a result of the reorganization under the 1992 Local Government Act. It was made into a unitary authority, meaning it assumed responsibility for all local government functions within its borders, which allowed it to have greater control over its own affairs. The 1992 Local Government Act aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of local government, reduce bureaucracy, and provide a clearer line of accountability between local authorities and their constituents. The Act was a key component of the wider reform of the local government system in the United Kingdom during the 1990s, and its effects can still be observed today in the organizational structures of many local authorities in England and Wales."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

What is the answer: The 1937 novel ‘The Road to Wigan Pier’ was written by which British author?","completion":"The 1937 novel 'The Road to Wigan Pier' was written by the renowned British author George Orwell, born Eric Arthur Blair on June 25, 1903, in Motihari, India. Orwell was a prolific writer and esteemed social and political commentator known for his sharp insights and powerful literary works. He authored several other notable books, including 'Animal Farm' and '1984,' both of which have become classics in the realm of political satire and dystopian fiction. 'The Road to Wigan Pier' is an insightful non-fiction account of Orwell's experience living among the working-class communities in the North of England for several weeks in the early 1930s during the Great Depression. The book is divided into two parts: the first part is a detailed examination of the social conditions and living standards of the coal miners and industrial workers in Lancashire and Yorkshire, while the second part is an extended essay reflecting on his own middle-class upbringing and the broader sociopolitical issues surrounding class distinctions, poverty, and the rise of socialism in Britain at the time. Orwell's observations on the appalling living conditions and labor exploitation faced by the working class, as well as their resilience in the face of adversity, provided a stark depiction of the harsh realities of life during this tumultuous period in British history.

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: QINGDAO--Water and power supplies have been _ in the East Chinese city of Qingdao, the site of an oil pipeline explosion on Friday, the local government said on Monday. Crude oil began leaking from the pipeline at 3:00 an Friday in Qingdao in Shandong province. The valves of the Huangdao oil warehouse were shut about 15 minutes later. The oil spill then flowed into the city's rainwater pipe network, which empties into Jiaozhou Bay. Explosions occurred at two locations around 10:30 am Friday when workers were clearing the spill. According to the local government, about 85 percent of public heating and 90 percent of the gas supply were also brought back to normal as of Monday. Residents who have been taken to the temporary settlements are receiving bottled water and bread. Many schools and kindergartens have reopened classes after Friday's oil pipeline explosion. No injures and deaths of students or teachers have been reported following the explosions at an underground pipeline operated by Sinopec. The school buildings of one middle school in the district were seriously damaged during the explosions. Education authorities have arranged psychological help for students and teaching staff. All other 18 schools and kindergartens in the district reopened classes on Monday. As of Monday noon, the death toll from the explosion had risen to 55, with 9 people still missing and 136 hospitalized. According to local police, 49 bodied have been identified so far, and 42 of them were male victims. As of Monday morning, the blood supply in Qingdao was enough for the injured after more than 950 people in the city donated more than 340,000 ml of blood in the wake of the incident. Question: We can learn from the passage that _ . Options: A: everything was brought back to normal right after the explosion B: no measures were taken to help the suffering people out of trouble C: no more dead body was found after Monday noon D: all the 19 schools in the district were affected by the explosion The answer is:","completion":"To find the correct answer among the given options, I will analyze the information in the article step-by-step and verify it with the options provided. 1. The article states that public heating, gas supply, and schools were brought back to normal after the incident. Therefore, option A (everything was brought back to normal right after the explosion) is not correct because it implies that everything was fixed immediately. 2. The passage mentions several measures taken to help suffering people, like providing bottled water, bread, temporary settlements, opening schools, and blood donations. So, option B (no measures were taken to help the suffering people out of trouble) is incorrect. 3. The article does not provide information about whether any more dead bodies were found after Monday noon. Thus, option C (no more dead body was found after Monday noon) cannot be confirmed. 4. The passage states that 18 schools and kindergartens out of 19 in the district reopened classes, and one middle school building was seriously damaged. This means that all 19 schools were affected in some way. Option D (all the 19 schools in the district were affected by the explosion) is correct. So, based on my analysis, the answer is D: all the 19 schools in the district were affected by the explosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is an article: A 23-year-old black man named Sylville K. Smith was fatally shot by a black officer in Milwaukee on Saturday, Aug. 13. Here's what you need to know. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) Violent unrest continued in Milwaukee late Sunday and early Monday morning, a second night of tension after a fatal police shooting over the weekend. While the unease did not reach levels seen a night earlier, when multiple buildings were set on fire, it still suggested that the simmering anger could linger for days in Wisconsin’s biggest city. In a sign of how officials were trying to manage the situation and considering further steps, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett (D) on Monday said a 10 p.m. weekday curfew would be strictly enforced for teenagers. He also said that officials had spoken to the city attorney’s office to be prepared in case they decide a “more widespread curfew” is needed. “Parents, after 10 o’clock, your teenagers better be home, or in a place where they’re off the streets,” Barrett said at a news briefing. Speaking of the areas where demonstrations have occurred, he said: “This is not the place where you go to gawk. It is not the place you go to take pictures. It’s not the place you go to drive your car around right now.” Police said an 18-year-old man was shot Sunday night in the Sherman Park area, which has been the center of the demonstrations, and officers said they used an armored vehicle to get the teenager to the hospital. The 18-year-old was shot in the neck at 11 p.m., and was continuing to receive medical treatment Monday, police said. Milwaukee police also said that seven law enforcement officers were injured during the unease overnight Sunday and into Monday, and they said at least one officer was taken to the hospital for treatment. Four Milwaukee officers were injured, including two of whom had glass fragments in their eyes after concrete was thrown through the glass of their squad car, said Edward A. Flynn, the Milwaukee police chief. He also said three Milwaukee county sheriff’s deputies were injured by bricks and rocks thrown at their bodies. Flynn also said that a riot helmet worn by one officer had a “graze wound to the back of it, probably from a firearm,” he said. “This was not an evening of insignificant risk for our officers,” Flynn said. “But I am grateful to report, and they would be proud to know, that they successfully protected the community last night.” According to police, 14 people — 11 men and three women — were arrested overnight Sunday and into early Monday morning for disorderly conduct. All of the people arrested were from Milwaukee. Three police cars were damaged, while one store had its windows broken, the police said. Authorities also said that their ShotSpotter system — which tracks gunshots — was activated 30 times. “Gunfire remained a problem last night, as well as gunfire in the vicinity of officers that were attempting to … restrain what disorder did occur,” Flynn said at a briefing Monday. He said police officers never returned fire overnight Sunday, adding that there was “one reported use of police force,” though he did not elaborate on what force was used. .@MilwaukeePolice squad car damaged by thrown bricks, rocks and glass bottles near Sherman and Burleigh. pic.twitter.com/FRtRvRc4iL — Milwaukee Police (@MilwaukeePolice) August 15, 2016 Protesters are blocking Fond du Lac and Burleigh St. #MilwaukeeUprising pic.twitter.com/RduFfN7PtA — James E. Causey (@jecausey) August 15, 2016 There were reports of shots fired in parts of the city throughout the night, police said, and video footage from the scene showed crowds facing off with police officers clad in riot gear. Authorities said they used armored vehicles to move into the crowds, while police were also ordering people gathered on the streets to disperse. Even as the city reeled in the aftermath of the demonstrations, authorities also released more details about the shooting that sparked the protests. Police said that the man who was shot Saturday — identified as 23-year-old Sylville K. Smith — was chased by an officer after fleeing a traffic stop about 3:30 p.m. According to Flynn, the Milwaukee police chief, Smith ran to a fenced area and turned to the officer while holding a gun. The officer, who has not been identified, fired at Smith, hitting him twice and killing him. Flynn said there was no evidence that Smith fired the gun he had, which he said held 23 bullets at the time. This shooting was captured by the officer’s body camera, Flynn said during a news conference Sunday. On Monday, Flynn pushed back at suggestions that Smith was unarmed when he was shot, saying again that Smith had a gun in his hand when he was shot. Barrett also said that while he had not seen the full video of the shooting, he saw a still image showing a gun in Smith’s hand. Flynn also said Monday that the autopsy of Smith showed that the 23-year-old was shot in the chest and arm. Smith was the 16th person shot and killed by police so far this year in Wisconsin, according to a Washington Post database tracking such shootings. [Police release more details of fatal shooting] In the hours after that shooting, protests in Wisconsin’s largest city gave way to heated demonstrations that drew national attention. Police said six businesses were set on fire Saturday night and early Sunday morning, while four officers were injured during the chaos. On Sunday morning, community members gathered to help clean up debris from the fires. Smith’s relatives pleaded for peace after the shooting, saying they were heartbroken by his death but adding that the violence would not help anyone. Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a prolific conservative commentator on cable news and social media, blamed “failed liberal urban policies” for Saturday night’s riots. Clarke, who frequently appears on Fox News and pillories President Obama, was a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention last month, where he compared the Black Lives Matter protesters to anarchists. “The social order in Milwaukee totally collapsed on Saturday night,” Clarke told Fox Business Network on Monday. “And when the social order collapsed, tribal behavior takes over. And when tribal behavior takes over, the law of the jungle replaces the rule of law, and that’s why you end up with what you saw.” Clarke had asked that the Wisconsin National Guard be mobilized after the violence Saturday night. Gov. Scott Walker (R) said Sunday he activated the Wisconsin National Guard to be ready to help if called upon by law enforcement officials in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee Police Department said in the middle of the night that it had not called on the National Guard, saying that local police and other agencies were still responding. “I join Milwaukee’s leaders and citizens in calling for continued peace and prayer,” Walker said in a statement. “It is also important for citizens to know that Wisconsin is the first state in the nation to have a law requiring an independent investigation anytime there is a shooting by a law enforcement officer that leads to a death. I will not comment on the specifics of the case as it is now under this investigation. I do, however, hope people will give law enforcement the respect that they deserve for working so hard to keep us safe.” Officer taken to hospital for injury after thrown rock breaks windshield of squad near Sherman & Burleigh. pic.twitter.com/At5HDBOXHm — Milwaukee Police (@MilwaukeePolice) August 15, 2016 Cities across the country have been propelled into national headlines in recent years after unrest sparked by how police use force, particularly deadly force. This summer, the nation has also remained on edge after police shot and killed black men in Minnesota and Louisiana, followed quickly by shooting attacks that killed officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Police said the officer who shot and killed Smith is a 24-year-old who has been with the department for six years, three of them as an officer. He was not injured and has been placed on administrative duty during the investigation. Flynn, the police chief, said that the officer is African American, as was Smith. He also said that police were concerned about the officer’s safety and that he was with relatives outside Milwaukee. The shooting on Saturday is being investigated by Wisconsin’s Division of Criminal Investigation, under a state law signed in 2014 that requires the agency to investigate such deaths. “I am saddened by the senseless destruction caused by a handful of citizens in Milwaukee and appeal for calm,” Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel said in a statement. “I know the vast majority of Milwaukee residents are law-abiding citizens who want and deserve safe neighborhoods and communities. … I pray that the law enforcement officers and firefighters who are working to protect the citizens of Milwaukee will be safe throughout this ordeal and that no other journalists or innocent citizens will be further harmed.” Schimel vowed that the state would “work expeditiously to ensure a thorough and transparent gathering of the facts.” The state agency also investigated the shooting death last year of Anthony Robinson Jr. in Madison. When it concluded its probe, it handed the findings to the local district attorney, who said he would not pursue charges. The current unrest in Milwaukee follows protests and anger last year when the Justice Department said that a former Milwaukee police officer who shot and killed Dontre Hamilton — a man with mental-health problems killed in 2014 — would not face civil rights charges stemming from that shooting. Not long after, the Justice Department said that its Office of Community Oriented Policing Services would begin what is known as a collaborative reform process with the Milwaukee police force. These kinds of reviews are not like the “pattern or practice” probes carried out by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division — like the one just concluded in Baltimore — which can end with agreements involving court orders. Collaborative reviews, by comparison, involve a review of a police department’s polices and practices, followed by an assessment and publicly released progress reports. Milwaukee is one of several major American cities still dealing with a recent spike in bloodshed and violence. Last year, homicides in the city spiked significantly, increasing to 146 deaths from 86 a year earlier. The city also saw increases in the overall numbers of violent crimes, according to police statistics. This story, first published at 8:44 a.m., will be updated throughout the day.

Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.","completion":"Based on the information provided, Paul, who studied the Gaia hypothesis, would have learned more about carbon dioxide levels.

Is it true that does the colorado river make it to the ocean based on the following text? Reduction in flow caused by dams, diversions, water for thermoelectric power stations, and evaporation losses from reservoirs -- the latter of which consumes more than 15 percent of the river's natural runoff -- has had severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. Historically, the delta with its large freshwater outflow and extensive salt marshes provided an important breeding ground for aquatic species in the Gulf. Today's desiccated delta, at only a fraction of its former size, no longer provides suitable habitat, and populations of fish, shrimp and sea mammals in the gulf have seen a dramatic decline. Since 1963, the only times when the Colorado River has reached the ocean have been during El Niño events in the 1980s and 1990s.","completion":"Based on the given text, it can be concluded that the Colorado River does not consistently make it to the ocean.

These factors have led to severe ecological consequences in the Colorado River Delta and the Gulf of California. The Colorado River Delta has shrunk due to decreased freshwater outflow, and thus, it no longer supports suitable habitat for aquatic species.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1939, Nazi Germany's largest and most powerful battleship, Bismarck, is launched in a ceremony at Hamburg with Adolf Hitler attending. The launching of the hull is seen as the beginning of a new era of German sea power. Two years later, in 1941, British convoys are being ravaged by U-boats and surface raider attacks that cut off supplies essential for Britain's abilities to continue the war. In May, British intelligence discovers the Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen are about to break out of the Baltic and into the North Atlantic to attack convoys. Meanwhile, a spy in Norway spots the Bismarck and its escort Prinz Eugen; he attempts to alert the British by telegraph but he is discovered by the Germans and killed. The spy is only able to message that one of the ships is Prince Eugen but is shot before he can message that the second ship was the Bismarck. The man assigned to co-ordinate the hunt is the Admiralty's chief of operations, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More), who has been distraught over the death of his wife in an air raid and the sinking of his ship by German ships commanded by Admiral GÃ¼nther LÃ¼tjens (Karel Å tÄpÃ¡nek). Upon receiving his new post, Shepard discovers LÃ¼tjens is the fleet commander on the Bismarck. Shepard's experience of conflict with Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and his understanding of LÃ¼tjens allow him to predict the Bismarck's movements. Shepard acts coldly to his staff but comes increasingly to rely on the coolness and skill of his assistant, WRNS Second Officer Anne Davis (Dana Wynter). LÃ¼tjens is also bitter. After the First World War, he considered that he had received no recognition for his efforts in the war. LÃ¼tjens promises the captain of the Bismarck, Ernst Lindemann (Carl MÃ¶hner), that this time, he and Germany will be remembered in greatness.

Here is an article: Pro-Russian activists in Ukraine's industrial centre of Donetsk have proclaimed their independence from Kiev and pledged to hold a referendum in the next month, provoking fears that Moscow could be orchestrating a second Crimea scenario in Ukraine's east. \\"Seeking to create a popular, legitimate, sovereign state, I proclaim the creation of the sovereign state of the people's republic of Donetsk,\\" said a man into a loudspeaker outside the seized regional administration building to a cheering crowd. The protesters said they would hold a referendum no later than 11 May on the region's status, and also asked Russia to ready \\"peacekeeping troops\\", in a scenario reminiscent of the events that led to the annexation of Crimea last month. In Kiev, the interim prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, said events in the east were being carried out according to a script written in Moscow. \\"An anti-Ukrainian plan is being put into operation … under which foreign troops will cross the border and seize the territory of the country,\\" Yatsenyuk told a cabinet meeting in Kiev. \\"We will not allow this.\\" Russia is believed to have massed tens of thousands of troops on the border. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said last week that Putin told her those troops would be removed, but on Monday, Daniel Baer, US ambassador to the OSCE, said there was no sign of this. \\"We have strong evidence that there are tens of thousands of forces on the border and again not in their normal peacetime positions or garrisons,\\" he said. The White House claimed pro-Russian demonstrators in eastern Ukraine were paid outsiders, but declined to specify who it believed provided the money, simply blaming Moscow in general for renewed \\"provocation\\" The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, told reporters: \\"We are concerned about several escalatory moves in Ukraine over the weekend. We see these as a result of increased Russian pressure on Ukraine. We saw groups of pro-Russian demonstrators take over government buildings in the eastern cities of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk. \\"If Russia moves into eastern Ukraine, either overtly or covertly, this would be a very serious escalation. We call on President Putin and his government to cease all efforts to destabilise Ukraine and we caution against further military intervention.\\" Writing in the Guardian, however, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, says it is the west, and not Russia, that is guilty of destabilising Ukraine. He says the EU and US have been pursuing an \\"unproductive and dangerous\\" policy in the region. \\"They have been trying to compel Ukraine to make a painful choice between east and west, thus further aggravating internal differences,\\" writes Lavrov, adding that Russia wants Ukraine to carry out constitutional reform and guarantee its status as a non-aligned state that will never accede to Nato. \\"We are not imposing anything on anyone. We just see that if it is not done, Ukraine will continue to spiral into crisis with unpredictable consequences,\\" writes Lavrov. Russia's foreign ministry said it was \\"carefully observing\\" events in the east and south of Ukraine, and again called for \\"real constitutional reform\\" to turn the country into a federation. Moscow told Ukraine to stop blaming Russia for its problems. At a meeting with security chiefs in Moscow on Monday, Putin called for vigilance against foreign-funded NGOs promoting political unrest in Russia. \\"We will not accept a situation like what happened in Ukraine, when in many cases it was through non-governmental organisations that the nationalist and neo-Nazi groups and militants, who became the shock troops in the anti-constitutional coup d'etat, received funding from abroad,\\" he said. How much current events in eastern Ukraine are under the control of the Kremlin is unclear, but when Putin appealed to the Russian parliament for authorisation to use troops in Ukraine in February, the resolution did not specify that it applied to Crimea only, leaving the door open for a further incursion into the east. In Donetsk and other eastern Ukrainian cities, which are largely Russian-speaking, there is real discontent with the new government in Kiev, which has been in power since President Viktor Yanukovych fled at the culmination of months of street protests. Nevertheless, the region is far less pro-Russian than Crimea, and analysts say Russia would find it harder and more complicated to introduce troops there. In Donetsk on Monday, the regional administration centre was surrounded with tyres and razor wire and the Russian flag was flying. In Lugansk, another eastern city, activists seized a building beloning to security services. In Kharkov, two protests, one in favour of Ukrainian unity and the other pro-Russian, clashed across police lines in the afternoon. The protests are believed to be being carried out by a small minority in each city. Nevertheless, Russian complaints that the east and south of the country are not being given a voice in the new government have been echoed by some in Kiev itself. Mustafa Nayem, a journalist who was one of the instigators of the protest that led to the ousting of Yanukovych, complained that the new government had not done enough to reassure the east. \\"Since Viktor Yanukovych fled, more than a month has passed, and during that time not a single leader from the new government has been to Donetsk, Kharkov or Lugansk. It is unclear who is representing the interests of people in these regions at a national level,\\" he wrote on Facebook on Sunday. He said the government should hold cabinet meetings in the east, visit local elites and involve them in decision making, rather than \\"sitting in Kiev like cowards\\". Also on Monday, Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister who is standing in presidential elections planned for 25 May, flew to Donetsk for consultations. Ukraine is already reeling from losing the Crimea peninsula to Russia, where there were reports in the morning that a Ukrainian army officer had been shot dead by a Russian soldier. Russia now has full control over the region, and Ukraine's natural resources minister estimates that Ukraine lost 10.8bn of natural resources and other assets in the annexation. Russia, meanwhile, has claimed that Ukraine has accrued a de facto debt of 11bn after the cancelling of a gas discount that it says was given in advance. Even Ukraine admits that it has a 2.2bn debt for gas, and Gazprom said it had not received any money towards this amount of, nor any payment for March deliveries. It is unclear what the next step will be and whether Gazprom will turn off supplies. Last week Gazprom raised the price by 80% to 485 per 1000 cubic metres, meaning Ukraine would pay a higher price for gas than western European countries. Yatsenyuk called the price \\"political\\" and said Ukraine would not pay.

Context: U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why was RealClearPolitics involved? Answer: Choose your answer from: 1). not enough information. 2). analysts are a key indicator of Republican strength heading into midterms. 3). analysts are a key indicator of party strength heading into midterms. 4). analysts are a key indicator of Democratic strength heading into midterms.

I have so much I want to do first.\\" In a book published last year, Hawking wrote that God did not create the universe, in what he said was an attempt to banish a divine creator from physics. Hawking says in the book \\"The Grand Design\\" that given the existence of gravity, \\"the universe can and will create itself from nothing.\\" \\"Spontaneous creation is the reason why there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist,\\" he wrote in the introduction of the book, which was published in September. \\"It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper (fuse) and set the universe going,\\" Hawking wrote.

Here is an article: A rapper and his wife were found dead in an upscale Los Angeles apartment on Monday in an apparent murder-suicide, police said. Songwriter Earl Hayes and Stephanie Moseley, an actress and dancer on VH1′s drama series “Hit the Floor,” were discovered Monday morning after police responded to a call reporting gunshots. Los Angeles police officer Liliana Preciado told The Washington Post investigators are treating the shooting as a murder-suicide in which Hayes, who once signed with professional boxer Floyd Mayweather’s record label, allegedly killed his wife before turning the gun on himself. The motive is unknown. “I suddenly heard screaming,” Hayes’s neighbor Charles Segal told NBC Los Angeles, “and then the screaming stopped and the next minute cops all over.” The initial caller reported about 10 shots in the Park La Brea housing complex on Hauser Boulevard, police told CBS Los Angeles. Officers arrived at about 7:30 a.m. and, once inside, heard two more shots. A room in the apartment was locked, and officers believed someone was barricaded inside. A SWAT team later entered a bedroom and found two bodies. The investigation is “moving very slow and methodical … because they want to get it right,” LAPD Sgt. Barry Montgomery told NBC Los Angeles. Burrel L. Wilks said he was Hayes’s life coach and knew the couple well. “I’ve had sit downs with both of them so whatever happened behind those doors we’ll never know, but I heard out of her own mouth, he never raised a hand on her so this is kind of stunning,” he told the station. Moseley starred on “Hit the Floor,” a show about NBA cheerleaders, and danced for many artists, including Beyonce, Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna, Britney Spears as well as Chris Brown, who paid tribute to the dancer on his Instagram. “RIP baby girl,” Brown wrote. “Danced with me on tour and was always the coolest person. My prayers go out to you and HAZE family.” Celebrities such as Ashley Tisdale, 50 Cent and “Dancing With the Stars” performer Allison Holker also commented on social media. “Today we bow our heads and send prayers to our special Stephanie and her beautiful family,” Holker wrote on Instagram. “Stephanie was a bright, inspiring, talented woman and I am honored I could call her my friend. We shared cries, laughter and more importantly a friendship that I will never forgot. Moseley you taught me so much, and I will hold our memories close to my heart. Heaven is lucky to have you.

As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections.

As the world's most wanted man, his capture seemed an almost impossible feat. However, on one fateful day, with the help of cutting-edge technology and vital intelligence, authorities successfully closed in on Guzman, signaling a major victory against drug cartels. This article delves into the details of the operation that led to Guzman's capture, illustrating the complexities behind it, and shedding light on the risks involved in bringing him to justice. The Capture of Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman: (Step 1: Explain the situation during the raid. Mention the AK-47 next to his bed.) During the raid, Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman was found lying in his bed with an AK-47 placed next to him. The presence of the weapon signaled the danger posed to the law enforcement officers involved in the operation, making it clear that Guzman was prepared to take extreme measures to protect himself and resist capture. (Step 2: Discuss his capture after more than a decade on the run.) After more than a decade of evading capture and slipping through the hands of the authorities, the Sinaloa cartel boss was finally captured, bringing an end to a long-drawn manhunt that spanned continents and captivated the attention of the world. Authorities managed to navigate through a tangled web of deception, danger, and secrecy to finally apprehend Guzman, marking a significant moment in the war against drug cartels. (Step 3: Explain the use of modern technology in the form of infrared scanners during the investigation.) In a fascinating twist, it was the use of infrared scanners that ultimately helped pinpoint Guzman's location. These advanced surveillance devices enabled investigators to accurately detect the heat signatures emitted by the cartel boss, his associates, and surrounding equipment, giving them a crucial advantage in their pursuit. By employing this groundbreaking technology, officials were able to overcome the challenges posed by Guzman's carefully crafted protective measures, thereby closing in on him more effectively. (Step 4: Mention the use of wiretaps and informants in the operation.) Furthermore, the operation leveraged an intricate network of wiretaps and informants that aided investigators in understanding Guzman's operations, movements, and—the crucial piece—his whereabouts. These invaluable sources of intelligence allowed authorities to better plan their assault on the Sinaloa cartel boss, ensuring maximum chances of success with minimum risks to law enforcement personnel. Conclusion: The capture of Joaquin \\"El Chapo\\" Guzman is a testament to the determination, skill, and innovation of law enforcement officials who relentlessly pursued one of the world's most feared cartel leaders. The story of the operation highlights the importance of collaboration, advanced technology, and solid intelligence networks in the fight against organized crime and drug cartels. Ultimately, Guzman's capture serves as a beacon of hope that justice can be delivered, no matter how elusive or powerful the nemesis may be."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chicagoan Chester \\"Chet\\" Ripley, his wife, Connie, and their two sons, Buckley \\"Buck\\" and Ben, are on vacation at a lake resort in Pechoggin, Wisconsin during the summer. All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy.

[-] no [-] yes","completion":"First question: How can one overcome ophthalmophobia? To answer this question, we need to explore the various steps to overcome ophthalmophobia, which is a fear of being stared at or a fear of eyes. Here are some steps: 1. Education: Learning about the phobia, its causes, and the reasons behind the fear can help in understanding and managing the phobia better. Knowledge is power, and the more informed one is about their phobia, the easier it is to work through it. 2. Therapy: Seeking professional help, such as from a psychologist or a psychiatrist, can provide support and guidance on how to overcome the phobia. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Exposure Therapy are common therapeutic approaches to overcome phobias. 3. Relaxation techniques: Practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce anxiety and stress associated with ophthalmophobia. 4. Support groups: Joining a support group for people with phobias can provide a safe and encouraging environment to share experiences and learn from others who are going through similar challenges. 5. Gradual exposure: Gradually exposing oneself to the trigger, in this case, eyes or being stared at, can help desensitize the person to the fear, making it more manageable over time. This should be done under the guidance of a professional. Second question: How do I overcome it? This reiterates the question of how one can overcome ophthalmophobia but with a personalized aspect. The steps mentioned above would still apply. However, the person asking this question might be seeking a more personalized approach to tackle their specific case of ophthalmophobia. In such a case, it would be important to consult a mental health professional who can tailor the treatment according to individual needs. Are these two questions asking the same thing?

The answer you provided is accurate in terms of describing the development, collaborators, and advancements made on the solar engine, but it does not directly answer the question asked. Frank Shuman, an American inventor, patented his solar engine on March 2, 1912. This invention was an early attempt to harness the power of the sun for practical applications. Shuman, along with the technical assistance of A.S.E. Ackermann, a German science educator, and the support of British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system that aimed to increase the efficiency of solar energy collection. Their innovative approach involved the use of mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, which in turn would increase the heating capacity of the system. This enhancement enabled the use of water as a working fluid to capture and store solar energy, as opposed to the more volatile and less effective ether that was previously used. By utilizing water, the efficiency and storage capacity of solar power increased and opened the door to many potential applications. The development of Shuman's solar engine, though not commercially successful at the time, can be seen as a critical development in the history of solar energy technology. It was a pioneering effort in finding innovative ways to harness solar power, with the potential to provide clean and sustainable energy for various uses. This laid the groundwork for more advanced research and development of solar energy systems, which now play an increasingly important role in the global push for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources as we face growing environmental concerns and demands for increased energy production."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Sometimes the best advice doesn't come from a book, a microphone, from behind a desk in Washington or even from the people who are the leaders in their fields. Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day. The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \\"together\\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation. I now have my Dad's pocket Bible. It is one of my most treasured possessions, and it serves... Question: While building the new shed with his father, the author_.

Elvis arrives at the church of Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt). He watches his sermon from the back of the church and then follows him and his family, including his wife Twyla (Laura Harring), son Paul (Paul Dano) and daughter Malerie (Pell James), to their home. Pastor Sandow confronts Elvis, who shows him a snapshot of his mother Yolanda, with whom he had relations many years ago before becoming a Christian. Pastor Sandow becomes agitated and tells Elvis that he has a family now and is a popular member of the community. He tells Elvis to call him so they can talk, though later tells his family that the young man simply wanted to become a member of the church and to not associate with him. Elvis moves in to a local motel and gets a job as a pizza delivery man. Having met Pastor Sandow's teenage daughter Malerie earlier at the church, he soon begins to pick her up from school where they go on drives and take walks at a local park. They start a passionate affair and have sexual relations on a regular basis. Meanwhile, Pastor Sandow's son Paul leads a high school movement where he attempts to change the school's science curriculum from evolution to intelligent design, though his plans are rejected by the school board. Disappointed by this setback, Paul, who leads a Christian rock band at his father's church, performs an intimate song before the congregation about his frustrations, the song being a cover of Sparklehorse's \\"Sad and Beautiful World\\". Pastor Sandow severely chastises his son for such indulgence. One evening, Elvis sneaks into the Sandow's home to spend the night with Malerie.

Steps: 1. Calculate the area of the rectangular grass field. 2. Calculate the area of the entire rectangle including the path. 3. Subtract the grass field area from the area calculated in step 2 to find the area of the path. 4. Multiply the area of the path by Rs. 2 per sq m to find the cost of constructing the path. 5. Choose the correct answer from the given options. Solution: 1. Area of the grass field = length * width = 65 m * 55 m = 3575 sq m. 2. The width of the path is 2.5 m.

Benjamin is taking care of his friend Randy's moss roses, because","completion":"Randy had to leave town for a few weeks on a business trip. Benjamin, being a good friend and quite the gardening enthusiast, happily agreed to help. Randy had given him explicit instructions to ensure the plants thrive in his absence. Step 1: Analyzing the situation Before diving in, Benjamin took note of the location, sunlight exposure, and overall condition of the moss roses currently in Randy's garden. The plants seemed healthy and well-established, indicating that Randy had been taking good care of them up to this point. Step 2: Researching care requirements Benjamin took some time to research the specific needs of moss roses, which included the preferred amount of sunlight, water, and appropriate soil conditions. He learned that moss roses thrive best in full sunlight and well-draining soil, and they require regular watering, but not too much as to avoid root rot. Step 3: Checking the soil Benjamin checked the soil where Randy's moss roses were planted to ensure it was well-draining and contained the right nutrients for the plants. He also verified that the plants were spaced adequately to promote healthy growth. Step 4: Monitoring sunlight exposure Since moss roses require full sunlight, Benjamin made sure the spot they were planted in received a minimum of six hours of direct sunlight per day. He also observed the movement of the sun across the garden to guarantee no large obstacles were obstructing the light and that there was no need to transfer the plants to another location. Step 5: Watering routine Benjamin established a watering routine based on Randy's recommendations and his own research. This entailed providing the plants with approximately one inch of water per week, either through rainfall or manual watering. To prevent overwatering, he monitored the soil moisture regularly to ensure it didn't become waterlogged. Step 6: Pruning and deadheading Benjamin made sure to prune any dead or unhealthy branches from the moss roses, as well as remove any spent blooms. This would encourage new growth and keep the plants looking neat and well-maintained. Step 7: Pest and disease control Benjamin kept an eye out for any signs of pests or diseases in the moss roses and treated them promptly using organic and environmentally friendly solutions. This would ensure that the plants remained healthy and flourishing during Randy's absence. Step 8: Fertilizing Randy had instructed Benjamin on the fertilizing schedule he had been following for the moss roses. Benjamin continued using the recommended fertilizer, making sure to apply it carefully and sparingly, to avoid burning the plants or causing excessive growth. Step 9: Regular check-ins Throughout the weeks, Benjamin stayed vigilant in examining the overall health and progress of Randy's moss roses. He adjusted his care routine as needed, making sure the plants always had the best chance at thriving. Upon Randy's return, he was greeted with a beautifully blooming garden of moss roses. He was grateful to Benjamin for the exceptional care provided and delighted to see his cherished plants flourishing under his friend's diligent supervision. The two friends then savored their shared appreciation for the beauty of nature, strengthening their bond over their common love for gardening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Options: A. new york B. washington state C. valley D. rainforest E. park A:","completion":"D. Rainforest An apple tree is not likely to be found in a rainforest, as these environments are not suitable for the tree to grow properly. Apple trees, which belong to the genus Malus, thrive in cooler climates with adequate sunlight, well-draining soil, and proper moisture levels. Rainforest environments, on the other hand, are characterized by high levels of humidity, precipitation, and dense vegetation. The climate in rainforests is usually warm and moist, with reduced sunlight reaching the ground level due to the dense canopy layer. In contrast, other options, such as New York (A), Washington State (B), a valley (C), or a park (E), are more suitable for apple tree growth given that climate and soil conditions are more favorable in these areas. New York and Washington State, both located in the United States, have regions known for apple production. These climates are more temperate and provide the ideal conditions necessary for the growth of apple trees. In particular, Washington State is widely regarded as a prime location for apple farming due to its combination of sunny days, cool nights, and the right amount of moisture from the Cascade Mountains. This environment allows for the cultivation of high-quality and flavorful fruits. Valleys (C) can also provide suitable environments for growing apple trees, depending on the specific location. Some valleys offer moderate climates and rich soil conditions that support a variety of fruit trees, including apple trees. Generally, valleys with moderate temperature fluctuations, good sunlight exposure, and well-draining soil can provide ideal conditions for apple trees to flourish. Lastly, parks (E) may also contain apple trees. Depending on the park's location, climate, and landscape design, apple trees can be planted and maintained in parks for recreational and aesthetic purposes. In conclusion, the rainforest (D) is the least likely location to find an apple tree due to the unfavorable climate and environmental factors associated with such ecosystems, while the other options offer more suitable conditions for apple tree cultivation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - energy - frequency - amplitude - voltage A: Answer:","completion":"A: Within a circuit in an analog signal, what is continuously changing is the voltage. An analog signal is a continuous signal that fluctuates over time, representing varying levels of information. Unlike digital signals, which represent information using discrete binary values (0 or 1), analog signals can have infinite variations in their levels. In the context of an electrical circuit, the analog signal can be represented by the continuous variation of voltage or current across various components of the system. The voltage in an analog circuit changes perpetually, representing the different values and characteristics of the input information. This characteristic is vital because it means that analog signals can provide a more accurate representation of the input information compared to digital signals, especially in scenarios where precise and continuous variations are essential, such as audio or video signals. Although energy, frequency, and amplitude are all related to analog signals, they are not the primary aspects continuously changing within a circuit. Energy, in the context of analog signals, typically refers to the power supplied to the circuit or the energy consumed by the components of the circuit. Frequency refers to the rate at which the signal changes or oscillates, and amplitude represents the signal's maximum value or strength. While frequency and amplitude might change as the signal processes or filters, they are not constantly varying elements in the circuit. In summary, voltage is the essential element that changes continuously within a circuit in an analog signal. This continuous variation allows analog signals to provide more accurate and precise representations of the input information over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Location The PTK site was discovered in 2012 by The Olduvai Paleoanthropology and Paleoecology Project (TOPPP) at the junction of the main and secondary branches of Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The site is situated ~500 m south of the well-known FLK 22 Zinjanthropus (FLK 22 Zinj) site and, to date, it is known to comprise three distinct archaeological levels (Supplementary Fig. 2). Two of these levels, corresponding to what has been defined as ‘upper Zinj’ and ‘lower Zinj’21, occur in the same clay stratum as the FLK 22 Zinj level, underlying volcanic Tuff IC, dated by 40Ar/39Ar to 1.832 + 0.003 Ma (ref. 22). PTK’s third archaeological level underlies the Zinj clay, within the tuffaceous layer known as the ‘Chapati Tuff’23, and corresponds stratigraphically to the top of the Olduvai Bed I archaeological level designated as FLK NN 2. TOPPP’s 2014 excavation of this third level at PTK yielded abundant Mode I stone artefacts and a large faunal assemblage, which includes the MHL hominin proximal phalanx OH 86, described here. Figure 1: Geographic location of the ‘PTK’ site. The location of the new PTK site (from which the OH 86 proximal phalanx was excavated) compared with two other major and penecontemporaneous Middle Bed I (Olduvai Formation) sites of FLK 22 Zinjanthropus and FLK NN that also occur near the junction of the Main and Side Gorges.

Full size image (208 KB) Figures index Next Specimen identification and anatomical description OH 86 is a complete manual proximal phalanx that is nearly entirely encased in a very thin layer of the carbonated tuffaceous silt from which it derives (that is, the ‘Chapati Tuff’; Fig. 2). Although the areal spread of this concretion on OH 86 is encompassing, its submillimetre thinness guarantees little impact on the gross measurements that we derived on the specimen and analyse and discuss in this study. Basic osteometrics of OH 86 are listed in Supplementary Table 1. On the basis of several lines of morphometric evidence (see below), as well as qualitative features, we assign OH 86 to the fifth ray of the left hand. Applying published qualitative criteria36—including asymmetry of the specimen’s flexor ridges and distal trochlea, as well as the orientation of the latter, and its base’s palmar outline—OH 86 compares most favourably to a modern human manual proximal phalanx from ray V. Quantitative data—including head mediolateral width/base mediolateral width ratio=0.72, base mediolateral width/overall superoinferior length ratio=0.39—corroborate this qualitative diagnosis. Last, we tested this corresponding qualitative/quantitative ray assignment by conducting a discriminant function analysis of OH 86 and a comparative sample composed of modern human proximal phalanges from rays II and V (which tend to be more similar to each other because of asymmetries caused by muscle insertions, among others). This analysis confirms the results of the initial qualitative and quantitative tests, also indicating that OH 86 most probably derives from a fifth ray (with a probability six times more likely than ray II, using the seven shape variables, and with a probability 10 times more likely than ray II, using the seven raw dimensions; Supplementary Fig. 3). Assuming that the assignment of OH 86 as a fifth proximal phalanx is correct, it must also derive from a left hand on the basis of the pattern of asymmetry of the distal condyles: in palmar and dorsal views, the presumed radial condyle projects more inferiorly than does the presumed ulnar condyle. Further, the putative ulnar basal tubercle (insertion for the hypothenar muscles) is larger and protrudes more ulnarly and proximally than does the radial basal tubercle. Mosimann shape ratios. The overall size (as approximated by the geometric mean, GM) of OH 86 is within the range of modern humans and chimpanzees (Supplementary Fig. 4a), as it is the case of other hominins except Au. sediba (below the human range). In terms of relative length, OH 86 is in the midrange of humans and the upper range of gorillas, but below chimpanzees and monkeys (Supplementary Fig. 4b). OH 86 exhibits a MHL, dorsopalmarly short trochlea, although this value also overlaps with the lowermost range of African apes (Supplementary Fig. 4c). No trend is evident in mediolateral trochlear width, although it is worth noting that the trochlear proportions of OH 86 are virtually identical to those of the fossil Qafzeh 9 (H. sapiens; Supplementary Fig. 4d). With regard to midshaft dimensions, OH 86 is dorsopalmarly short (but still overlaps with the modern human outlier range; Supplementary Fig. 4e), and as a consequence it is also mediolaterally wider than are the midshafts of the proximal phalanges of other hominins (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Extant taxa exhibit similar values of relative basal dorsopalmar height as does OH 86 (Supplementary Fig. 4g), although Pan clearly stands out in its having relatively higher bases (but still overlapping with the remaining sample). In this respect, although all hominins fall within the modern human variation, a clear trend is evident: fossil Homo and OH 86 show very similar values, in the low interquartile range of H. sapiens, whereas all australopiths are in the upper interquartile range. Last, with regard to relative basal breadth (Supplementary Fig. 4h), modern humans (and cercopithecid monkeys) possess wider bases than do African apes. Pliocene australopiths fall in the African ape range, whereas the early Pleistocene Au. sediba, fossil Homo and OH 86 all exhibit values within the human range. When all these dimensions of proximal phalanx form variation (that is, the seven Mosimann shape ratios and the associated GM) are summarized by means of a principal components (PCA; Fig. 3a) and a cluster (Fig. 3b) analyses, the closest form affinities of OH 86 are revealed to be with Homo. In fact, based solely on the two major axes of form variation, our PCA (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5) clearly separates H. sapiens from Pan, Gorilla and cercopithecoid monkeys (Fig. 3a). Further, although all fossils exhibit their closest form affinities to H. sapiens, OH 86 is the oldest hominin phalanx within the modern human form space (as represented by the two first axes, accounting for 90.1% of total form variation). In addition, when all dimensions of phalangeal form are summarized using an unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram based on group centroids (Supplementary Fig. 4), it reveals a ‘Homo’ cluster nested within the ‘hominin’ group—with OH 86 being the oldest fossil in the sample placed within this ‘Homo’ cluster (Fig. 3b). In sum, modern human phalangeal form (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5) is characterized by moderate relative total proximodistal length, midshaft mediolateral robusticity and overall size (that is, intermediate values of PC1, similar to Pan) in combination with a mediolaterally wide and dorsopalmarly short trochlea and base (which, together with their shorter lengths, differentiate human and Pan proximal phalanges). More specifically, the bases of Homo proximal phalanges are mediolaterally wider and dorsopalmarly shorter than are those of australopiths (Supplementary Fig. 4g,h). In addition, on the basis of trochlear shape, the intermediate phalanges of australopiths—as well as those of OH 7—are clearly distinct from those of extant and fossil Homo7. This previous finding regarding manual intermediate phalanges corresponds to our independent analyses of complete manual proximal phalanges, indicating together that modern human phalangeal morphology can be accurately characterized quantitatively. Importantly, OH 7 does not conform to the modern human characterization, even though it is penecontemporaneous with the MHL OH 86. Figure 3: The form of the human proximal phalanx. (a) Plot showing the two major axes of proximal phalanx V form variation (that is, shape and size space).

(b) UPGMA cluster analysis summarizing eight dimensions of phalangeal form space: OH 86 is the oldest specimen within the Homo cluster.

Full size image (121 KB) Previous Figures index Phalangeal curvature. From functional and evolutionary perspectives, it is highly relevant that all australopith fifth proximal phalanges exhibit higher values of phalangeal curvature than do any of the extant and fossil Homo specimens (Fig. 4), denoting a biological transition in hominins towards less (if any) commitment to arboreal locomotion (at least as it is revealed from manual proximal phalanx anatomy). As with overall phalangeal form (Fig. 3), OH 86 falls exclusively within the modern human range of variation of fifth proximal phalanx curvature (Fig. 4); pooling results for curvature of all non-pollical proximal phalanges place OH 86 once again within the modern human range and in the lowermost range of Gorilla (Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, compared with the manual phalanges of O. tugenesis, Ar. ramidus, Au. afarensis, Au. sediba, the Swartkrans hominins and OH 7—whose powerfully built flexor insertions result in proximal phalanx diaphyseal morphology that includes distinctive, palmarly concave ‘outbowing’—the diaphysis of OH 86 lacks such pronounced flexor insertions and is thus much straighter in medial and lateral views (Fig. 2). ||||| The hominin finger bone likely came from the pinky finger of an adult left hand. Scientists have discovered the oldest known fossil of a hand bone to resemble that of a modern human, and they suggest it belonged to an unknown human relative that would have been much taller and larger than any of its contemporaries. This new finding reveals clues about when modern humanlike hands first began appearing in the fossil record, and suggests that ancient human relatives may have been larger than previously thought, researchers say in a new study. A key feature that distinguishes humans from all other species alive today is the ability to make and use complex tools. This capability depends not only on the extraordinarily powerful human brain, but also the dexterity of the human hand. \\"The hand is one of the most important anatomical features that defines humans,\\" said study lead author Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo, a paleoanthropologist at Complutense University of Madrid. \\"Our hand evolved to allow us a variety of grips and enough gripping power to allow us the widest range of manipulation observed in any primate. It is this manipulation capability that interacted with our brains to develop our intelligence.\\" [The 10 Biggest Mysteries of the First Humans] How the hand evolved Past analysis of fossils of hominins — the group of species that consists of humans and their relatives after the split from the chimpanzee lineage — has typically suggested that ancient hominins were adapted for a life spent in the trees. For instance, ancient hominin hands often possessed curved finger bones that were well suited for hanging from branches. Modern humans are the only living higher primates to have straight finger bones. Scientists have often suggested that modern hands evolved to use stone tools. However, recent hominin fossil discoveries have suggested a more complex story behind the evolution of the modern hand. For instance, the hand bones of some ancient hominin lineages are sometimes more similar to modern hands than those of more recent lineages are. \\"A modernlike hand in the past would tell us when humans became fully terrestrial and when and how efficiently our ancestors used tools,\\" Domínguez-Rodrigo told Live Science. To learn more about the evolution of the modern hand, scientists analyzed a newly discovered hand bone dated to more than 1.84 million years ago, dug up from Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. Previous excavations at Olduvai helped confirm that Africa was the cradle of humanity. The new bone was probably part of the little finger of the adult left hand of an unidentified hominin lineage similar to Homo erectus, the first hominin known to regularly keep tools it made. The bone is about 1.4 inches (3.6 centimeters) long — \\"the same size as the equivalent bone in our hand,\\" Domínguez-Rodrigo said. [See Photos of the Oldest Stone Tools] The straightness and other features of this new bone suggest adaptations for life on the ground rather than in the trees. It adds to previous findings suggesting that several key features of modern human body shape emerged very early in hominin evolution. (This unknown hominin was not, however, a modern human.) Previous research had suggested that hominins began walking on two legs about 6 million years ago, potentially helping to liberate their hands for tool use. Still, until about 2 million years ago, all known hominin hands showed a double function, allowing hominins to both climb trees and walk on two legs on the ground. (The human lineage Homo is thought to have evolved about 2 million to 3 million years ago; the oldest known extinct human species, Homo habilis, lived at least 1.8 million years ago.) Before this oldest known hand-bone fossil was discovered, scientists weren't certain when hominin hands began looking like modern hands and became specialized for manipulation. \\"Our discovery fills a gap — we found out that such a modern-looking hand is at least 1.85 million years old,\\" Domínguez-Rodrigo said. Big hominin These findings also reveal that this unknown hominin was larger than other hominins living at the same time or before it. If this newfound finger bone had belonged to a modern human, that person would likely be about 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters) tall, Domínguez-Rodrigo said. \\"Why is this important? Archaeologists have gathered enough information to understand that early sites like those of Olduvai are central places where hominins repeatedly transported carcasses up to more than 350 kilograms (770 lbs.), which were obtained via hunting,\\" Domínguez-Rodrigo said. \\"As a specialist on this topic, I always had trouble understanding how Homo habilis, barely taller than 1 meter (3.3 feet), could efficiently hunt animals that big.\\" \\"Now, the new discovery shows that a bigger and more modern-looking creature existed at the time these sites were formed,\\" he added. \\"This makes this creature a better candidate to explain the creation of these early archaeological sites.\\" The scientists detailed their findings online Aug. 18 in the journal Nature Communications.

These differences continue into adult life,she says.In public conversations,men talk most and interrupt other speakers more.In private conversations,men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style.Professor Tannen believes that,for women,private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy(,).For men,private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship. Teaching is one job where the differences between men's and women's ways of talking show.When a man teaches a woman,says Professor Tannen,he wants to show that he has more knowledge,and hence(,)more power in conversation.When a woman teaches another woman,however,she is more likely to take a sharing approach and to encourage her student to join in. But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful.She says women feel they achieve power by being able to help others.Although the research suggests men talk and interrupt people more than women,Professor Tannen says,women actually encourage this to happen because they believe it will lead to more intimacy and help to establish a relationship.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution? Solve o - 6*o = 25 for o.","completion":"To solve the algebraic equation o - 6*o = 25 for o, you should first simplify the left side of the equation. The left side of the equation consists of o - 6*o. You should perform the operation of multiplication before the operation of subtraction because of the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, on the left side of the equation, you're taking o and subtracting six times o (or 6o) from it. Mathematically, this may be simpler if we represent the first o as 1o. So the equation is now: 1o - 6o = 25 Subtract 6o from 1o and you get -5o, so the equation now looks like: -5o = 25 Next, to solve for o, we need to isolate o on one side of the equation. In order to do this, we need to get rid of the -5 that is currently multiplied by o. We do this by doing the opposite of multiplication which is division. We divide both sides of the equation by -5 because whatever operation we perform on one side of the equation, we must also perform on the other side to maintain equality. So now the equation looks like: -5o /-5 = 25 / -5 The -5's on the left cancel out leaving us with o. On the right side of the equation, 25 divided by -5 is -5. So: o = -5 So, o equals -5. This is the solution of the equation o - 6*o = 25."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following review positive or negative? I am moving to Ocotillo so I was really really really hoping the CHoP was great. I wanted a nearby steak place that we could love. So far CHoP underperformed. We called ahead for reservations. When we arrived on time, there were no seats available so we were allowed to sit at the bar and order drinks. 45 minutes later still no seats so we just ordered food at the bar. The bartender was very nice, and the drinks tasted great. Finally we took our seats an hour after arrival at the same time our food arrived. The Maui Rib Eye tasted great, but not incredible. We saw our waitress once. My wife ordered a salad which was pretty good. For what it is the price is pretty high; they are trying to be a middle-high end place without the service or experience to match. With incredible service, the food would cut it. But as it is, based on our experience, acceptable food with unacceptable service, means that without a groupon, we probably won't be back Despite not having seats for our reservation and despite having to order food at the bar and then move to a table we did not even get an \\"I'm sorry\\" or what would seem like a near obligatory drink or appetizer on the house for such a mistake.

The reviewer highlights their disappointment in several aspects of their experience at CHoP, contributing to an overall negative tone. They mention the establishment's underperformance and highlight the problems they encountered, such as not having seats ready despite having a reservation, having to wait for 45 minutes to an hour before being seated, and the lack of adequate service. However, there are some positive elements mentioned in the review. The bartender is described as very nice, the drinks are deemed great, the Maui Rib Eye is said to taste good, and the salad is considered pretty good. The review also expresses hope that their experience was a one-time occurrence and suggests that they might give the restaurant another chance due to its proximity to their new residence. Overall, the negative aspects of the review outweigh the positives, resulting in a mostly negative impression of CHoP. The reviewer sees potential for improvement with better service, but their current experience is not enough to make them eager to return without using a Groupon or living close to the establishment."},{"prompt":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who described Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God as \\"self-consciously musically written and less sample-based?\\" , can you please find it? After two more EPs on Kompakt, the Orb (now composed of only Paterson and Fehlmann) released Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt, which featured new material in addition to tweaked versions of their previous Kompakt output. By this stage, Allmusic observed, Thomas Fehlmann had become the primary creative figure in the Orb, \\"inhibiting Alex Paterson's whimsical impulses\\". Because of this, Okie Dokie was considerably more focused and less \\"goofy\\" than Cydonia and Bicycles & Tricycles. Fehlmann's trademark hypnotic loops and delays made him the centre of Okie Dokie production and, according to Pitchfork Media, made it \\"difficult to say where [Paterson] is in the picture\\". The Orb's releases with Kompakt gained them back much of their musical credibility with the press and showed that they could \\"age gracefully\\".In August 2006, the founders of the Orb - Paterson and Cauty - released Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God, their debut album as the Transit Kings with Guy Pratt and Pratt's associate, Dom Beken. The album featured appearances from Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr and comedian Simon Day. Beken described Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God as \\"self-consciously musically written and less sample-based\\" compared to the members' previous work.

Summarize: More than 200 civilians left, joining hundreds allowed out since the truce was agreed on Friday. But concerns remain over the fate of men of military age who face questioning by the Syrian authorities. Meanwhile, talks between the warring sides have continued in Geneva, with no sign of any breakthrough. In other developments: Meanwhile sharp words have been exchanged by Washington and Moscow after Russia again objected to a draft UN Security Council resolution - this time, one that would call on all sides to allow aid workers access across Syria. That was criticised by US President Barack Obama, who called Russia a \\"holdout\\" and suggested that by blocking the resolution it too was responsible for \\"starving civilians\\", along with Syria. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman dismissed the criticism as a \\"biased distortion\\", highlighting Russia's role in helping achieve the ceasefire in Homs and insisting Russia was as concerned about the humanitarian situation in Syria as Washington. But the BBC's Nick Bryant at the UN in New York says that although Russia has rejected this present draft, it has not slammed the door on an alternative resolution. Government troops have besieged Homs for 18 months. By Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The \\"humanitarian pause\\" in the Old City of Homs is a rare glimmer of light in a dark and devastating war. The UN says the mission has already helped a \\"significant\\" number of people to leave the besieged area and a \\"limited\\" amount of aid is getting through. The UN's resident humanitarian co-ordinator, Yacoub El Hillo, told me they were \\"baby steps\\" that, he hoped, could lead to the \\"giant steps\\" that were needed. But a rare truce also meant to build trust is exposing deep enmities. The longer the mission goes on, the more sensitive it becomes. Some pro-government forces are vehemently opposed to an operation that is allowing fighters to escape an area that has been the focus of heavy fighting for nearly two years. And the opposition is angry that young men who leave are being taken in for questioning. More than 100 have been released, but more than 200 are still being held. In Syria's brutal conflict, even humanitarian pauses cannot escape the cruel logic of war. Lyse on the ground in Homs Evacuations over the weekend were facilitated by a three-day truce, which was then extended until Wednesday, though the relief operation was halted by a day on Tuesday due to logistical reasons. Nearly 200 parcels containing flour, rice, vegetable oil and other foodstuffs were delivered on Wednesday. The UN's local humanitarian co-ordinator, Yacoub El Hillo, and Homs Governor Talal Barazi said more than 200 civilians had been taken out of Homs in Wednesday's operation. But hundreds of civilians remain trapped inside the Old City. Mr Barazi said an extension to the current ceasefire, due to end late on Wednesday, could be agreed. UN agencies have also expressed concern over the fate of dozens of men who were taken in by Syrian security personnel after they fled Homs. Mr Barazi said 111 men had been questioned and released, while 190 others were still being held. \\"I just want to say I hope that that the bigger percentage will all be released,\\" he told the BBC. \\"They are living in a shelter in very good conditions.\\" The Syrian authorities said the screening was necessary to weed out \\"terrorists\\". In Geneva, Syrian government and opposition negotiators met face-to-face again on Wednesday. The opposition proposed a transitional governing body (TGB) be set up to oversee a UN-monitored ceasefire across Syria and steer it out of the nearly three-year war. It would expel all foreign fighters, allow full humanitarian access and achieve a political solution to the war. But regime representatives refused to discuss the plan, saying it was broaching political questions prematurely, reported AFP news agency. UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has lamented a lack of progress in the talks - bringing forward a meeting with Russian and US officials by one day to Thursday in an apparent attempt to get them to apply pressure to the opposed Syrian sides. The first round of talks ended last month with no firm agreements and both sides trading insults. Meanwhile, the bloodshed continues inside Syria, with the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights saying Syrians are being killed at a faster rate than ever. The British-based group, which has links to the opposition, said at least 4,959 people had died in the three-week period since 22 January, when the first round of Swiss talks began. The opposition wants the government to commit in writing to the 2012 Geneva Communique, which called for the formation of a transitional administration with full executive authority. President Bashar al-Assad's government has ruled out any transfer of power. The civil conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives and has driven 9.5 million people from their homes.","completion":"A humanitarian pause in the besieged Syrian city of Homs has allowed more than 200 civilians to leave, while talks continue between warring sides in Geneva.

Question: Roland felt his stomach knotting. Having ridden out of the city through the Saint-Denis Gate, he now was nearly home, and the hurt inside was cutting so deep that he thought it would drive him mad. He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily. Why was Roland sweating? A. not enough information B. He wanted to make love to Nicolette C. Diane had died D. He was worried he has lied to Nicolette Answer:","completion":"D.

Article: Speak can be a fun command to teach any dog. If you want your Manchester Terrier to learn to speak, begin by finding something that causes your dog to bark. This may be a toy, a treat, or a particular noise. During training sessions, wave the object around or make the noise until your dog barks. Praise your dog for barking and give your dog a treat. Once your dog consistently barks in response to a certain stimuli, begin incorporating a command or hand gesture. For example, snap your fingers to get your dog to speak. Keep training each day, offering rewards each time your dog completes the behavior. Gradually phase out the object or noise you use and use only your command or gesture. Eventually, your Manchester Terrier should learn to speak on command. Roll over is taught in increments. To teach roll over, start by commanding your dog to lie down. Then, kneel down beside your dog and hold a treat near its nose. Gently press your dog's shoulder to get it to lie on its side. Use the treat to hold your dog's attention. Praise and reward your dog each time it moves on its side. From there, move your hand from your dog's shoulder to its backbone. While you do this, move the treat over slightly. Your dog should roll on its back to get closer to the treat. Keep moving the treat until the dog has completely rolled over. Say the command \\"Roll over\\" and reward your dog. Keep up this routine every day in brief sessions. Eventually, your dog should start going through the motions on its own. You will be able to reduce touching your dog during the trick and will not have to use a treat as lure. To teach shake, start by holding your hand in front of your dog while its sitting with your palm up. If you hold out your hand long enough, your dog may eventually sniff or lick your hand on its own. This can lead to pawing Once your dog paws your hand, say \\"Shake\\" and reward your dog with a treat and praise. Repeat this process until your dog lifts its hand naturally. If you do short training sessions like this each day, your dog will eventually learn to shake on command. Some dogs will not paw at their owners hands naturally. If your dog does not paw on its own, gently tap your dog's paw until it places its paw in your hand. To begin, command your dog to \\"sit.\\" From there, hold a treat over your dog's head to get it to stand. Say \\"Beg\\" or \\"Sit up\\" while your dog does this. If your dog jumps to grab the treat, say \\"No,\\" and then have your dog return to the sitting position. Repeat training sessions each day. Give your dog a treat as soon as it's standing on its hind legs. Say your command while your dog is standing. With daily training sessions, your dog will eventually learn to beg on cue.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable... answer the following question: What is the name of the person whose talent was recognized by an award of £100 from the British Institution in 1828?

The Majestic was converted to accommodate vaudeville shows in the 1920s and eventually into a movie house in the 1950s. The change to film came with renovations that transformed the lobby and covered up much of John Galen Howard's original Beaux-Arts architecture. Context_4 : Pacific Place is a Class-A office skyscraper located at 1910 Pacific Avenue in the City Center District of Dallas, Texas. The structure contains 20 floors of office space and stands adjacent to the historic Majestic Theatre.

Located in Boston's Washington Street Theatre District on the edge of the Boston Common, the school also maintains buildings in Los Angeles and the town of Well, The Netherlands. Context_6 : The Piano Row District is a historic district encompassing two blocks of buildings facing Boston Common at the corner of Tremont Street and Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts. The district extends along Boylston from Park Square to Tremont, and along Tremont to Avery Street. The district also includes two buildings on Tremont just south of Boylston: the Cutler Majestic Theater, and the 1925 Union Savings Bank building at 216-218 Tremont. This area was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and became known as \\"Piano Row\\" because of the concentration of music-related businesses, including several piano showrooms. The flagship store for M. Steinert and Sons, Boston's longtime Steinway dealoer, has been located here since 1896, and features a fine underground performance hall, which has unfortunately been virtually abandoned due to fire codes.

Question: suppose a bigger satellite is designed happens, how will it affect a crew builds a smaller physical satellite. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"When a bigger satellite is designed, it will have more effect on the crew building a smaller physical satellite. This is because the bigger satellite will likely have an increased complexity due to larger size, additional components, and more intricate systems. This may require the crew working on the smaller satellite to adapt their building techniques and allocate additional resources, such as manpower and equipment, for effectively constructing and assembling the bigger satellite. However, the specific impact on the smaller satellite construction process would primarily depend on the shared resources and personnel involved in both projects. If the designs and construction of the two satellites are being carried out by separate teams with separate resources, then the perturbation caused by the new requirements for the bigger satellite might have less or no effect on the construction process of the smaller one. In summary, the influence of a bigger satellite design on the crew building a smaller physical satellite largely depends on the extent to which the projects share resources and workforce. If there is a significant overlap, it could have a more substantial effect, but if the projects are mostly independent, the effect might be less or nonexistent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. FIFA were in turmoil on Wednesday after their World Cup corruption investigator quit in protest at the systematic cover-up of his own report. Michael Garcia’s resignation statement could not have been more damning. The New York lawyer accused FIFA — and especially their ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert — of a wholesale whitewash of the murky Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cup bid campaigns. Garcia’s bombshell plunged world football’s wholly discredited ruling body into yet another crisis. UEFA president Michel Platini was the first to react, calling the sorry saga a ‘new failure for FIFA’. Michael Garcia has resigned from FIFA's ethics committee and cited a 'lack of leadership' Garcia alleged that FIFA had not only swept his findings under the carpet but tried to silence him by reporting him to their own disciplinary committee for speaking out. He also accused Eckert of having no independence and claims FIFA’s ingrained culture of self-preservation under Sepp Blatter meant it was impossible to bring about change. Garcia said: ‘It is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end. No independent governance committee, investigator or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation.’ And Garcia, who was head of FIFA’s ethics investigatory arm, went as far as saying about his colleague Eckert’s conclusions: ‘When viewed in the context of the report it purported to summarise, no principled approach could justify the Eckert decision’s edits, omissions and additions.’ He added that he had ‘lost confidence in the independence of the adjudicatory chamber’. Garcia's report was only published as a summary by FIFA, something Garcia himself quickly denounced. Garcia believes there has been a massive cover-up which he also fears will be the last word on the 2018 and 2022 bids. He chose to resign on the eve of FIFA’s executive committee meeting in Marrakech, which is due to vote on making his full report public, albeit with redactions where there are issues of confidentiality. Clearly, he believes there is no chance of this happening, especially as the FIFA appeals committee earlier this week turned down his complaint about Eckert’s ‘numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions’. His appeal was dismissed on the bizarre grounds that Eckert’s summary was not legally binding. The timing of his exit, along with his incendiary comments, now puts huge pressure on the 26-strong ExCo to vote for full publication. The move to publish was unlikely to have received the necessary majority before Garcia’s intervention but his views might have changed a few minds. Russia, Qatar and England were accused of breaking rules during the 2018 and 2022 bids in the report. JULY 2012. FIFA appoint US lawyer Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert to their Ethics Committee. Garcia is brought in to investigate bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. September 2014. Garcia submits his 350-page report. Eckert says it will not be made public, with only his summary published. OCTOBER 2014. Garcia, among others, calls for the report to be published in full and says of FIFA: ‘(The) investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard... (it) might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution.’ NOVEMBER 2014. Eckert publishes his summary, which clears Russia and Qatar of corruption, but claims England had undermined the integrity of bidding during their 2018 bid campaign. Garcia says the findings contain ‘erroneous representations ’, and says he will appeal. DECEMBER 2014. FIFA dismiss Garcia’s complaint to their Appeal Committee. Garcia resigns from the Ethics Committee. Garcia, who was appointed by FIFA to probe the two World Cup bid campaigns in July 2012, announced through his law firm Kirkland & Ellis: ‘For the first two years I felt that the ethics committee was making real progress. But in recent months that changed. ‘The report myself and deputy Cornel Borbely submitted identified serious and wide-ranging issues with the bidding and selection process. ‘Soon after, Hans-Joachim Eckert indicated only limited information would be made public. Concerned that insufficient transparency would not serve FIFA’s interests, I issued a public statement calling on the FIFA ExCo to authorise appropriate publication. ‘The ExCo took no action on this subject other than to refer me to the disciplinary committee for violating the ethics code through my public comments about publication and watches given to certain football officials.’ Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert pictured together earlier this year at FIFA headquarters in Switzerland. The disciplinary committee, not surprisingly, rejected FIFA’s complaint against their investigator. Garcia, who will not take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, had a final swipe at FIFA’s tarnished leadership. He said: ‘It now appears that at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert decision will stand as the final word on the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process. ‘And while the Eckert decision made me lose confidence in the independence of the adjudicatory chamber, it is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude my role in this process is at an end.’ However the prosecutions launched by Garcia against five senior football officials — including German great Franz Beckenbauer and FIFA ExCo members Angel Maria Villar of Spain, Thailand’s Worawi Makudi and Michel D’Hooghe of Belgium — can still be carried on by Garcia’s deputy Borbely. FIFA President Sepp Blatter (right) hands over the World Cup trophy to Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani. Meanwhile Domenico Scala, chairman of the compliance committee, has the role of deciding today what portions of Garcia’s work the ExCo should see. Prince Ali of Jordan, an advocate of reform who was the first inside the FIFA ExCo to call for the report to be published, said last night: ‘It’s a shame that we have lost Michael Garcia, for whom we had tremendous respect. It was a shock to hear and he must have done it for a reason. It is emblematic of some of the challenges FIFA have.’ FIFA’s British vice-president Jim Boyce said: ‘I am totally shocked. The ethics committee was our most important group.’ For the first two years after my July 2012 appointment as independent chairman of the FIFA Ethics Committee's Investigatory Chamber, I felt that the Ethics Committee was making real progress in advancing ethics enforcement at FIFA. In recent months, that changed. On September 5, 2014, I and Cornel Borbely, the deputy chair of the Investigatory Chamber, sent a 'Report on the Inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process' (the 'Report') to the FIFA Ethics Committee's Adjudicatory Chamber. The Report identified serious and wide-ranging issues with the bidding and selection process. (Mr Borbely also filed separate reports from his inquiries into the activities of the bid teams from Russia and the United States.) Soon after, the chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber, Hans-Joachim Eckert, indicated publicly that only limited information from the Report would be made public. Concerned that insufficient transparency would not serve FIFA's interests, I issued a public statement calling on the FIFA Executive Committee to authorise the appropriate publication of the Report. The Executive Committee took no action on this subject during its September 2014 meetings - other than to refer me to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for allegedly violating the Code of Ethics through my public comments, namely, my public request that the Executive Committee authorise appropriate publication of the Report and the on-the-record statement Mr Borbely and I released concerning watches given to certain football officials. The chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, Claudio Sulser, ultimately rejected the Executive Committee's referral. On November 13, 2014, Mr Eckert issued a 42-page 'Statement of the Chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee on the Report on the Inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process prepared by the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee' (the 'Eckert Decision'). In a cover letter, Mr Eckert described the statement as his 'findings, including certain descriptions of the contents of the Investigatory Chamber's report.' The issues raised by Mr Eckert's selection and omission of material from the Report, and his additional comments, went far beyond the initial transparency concerns. As my public statement at the time explained, the Eckert Decision contained 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions.' Accordingly, I appealed. A brief I filed with the FIFA Appeal Committee on November 24, 2014, outlined the Eckert Decision's most serious failings. Among other points, the brief explained why, when viewed in the context of the Report it purported to summarize, no principled approach could justify the Eckert Decision's edits, omissions, and additions. Yesterday's decision by the Appeal Committee declined to address these points. Instead, the Appeal Committee rejected my appeal on procedural grounds, concluding that 'it is not necessary for the FIFA Appeals Committee to enter into considerations on the substance of the appeal.' The Appeal Committee found that the Eckert Decision was 'merely a personal opinion on the Report' and had 'no legally binding effect whatsoever.' It reached this conclusion even though, under Article 36 of the Code of Ethics, only 'final decisions' may be made public, as the Eckert Decision, which was published on FIFA's website, obviously was. The Appeal Committee also overlooked the Eckert Decision's self-described 'findings,' including one stating that 'the evaluation of the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cups bidding process is closed for the FIFA Ethics Committee.' FIFA President Blatter recently reaffirmed that 'finding' during an interview published by FIFA, stating: 'Furthermore, there is no change to Judge Eckert's statement that the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups is concluded.' I disagree with the Appeal Committee's decision. It now appears that, at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert Decision will stand as the final word on the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. While the Appeal Committee's decision notes that further appeal may be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, I have concluded that such a course of action would not be practicable in this case. No independent governance committee, investigator, or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation. And while the November 13, 2014, Eckert Decision made me lose confidence in the independence of the Adjudicatory Chamber, it is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end. Accordingly, effective today, December 17, 2014, I am resigning as independent chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee.

Write a title for this article: A Ukrainian serviceman patrols the area as people stand in line to receive humanitarian aid near a delivery point in the government forces-controlled town of Debaltseve, Donetsk region, Feb. 6, 2015. REUTERS/Maxim The battle for east Ukraine is getting nastier by the day. Pro-Russian rebels, believed to be reinforced by Russian troops, are successfully pushing back against the Ukrainian army in an attempt to take over strategic transport and energy hubs, like Debaltseve and Mariupol, for the sake of making their self-proclaimed state more sustainable. Hundreds of thousands of civilians along the eastern Ukraine frontline have been affected by the brutal fighting. The death toll is rising rapidly: over 5,000 people have died in Ukraine since the fighting started in Spring 2014. Ukraine says 9,000 Russian troops are inside the country, 50,000 more are on the border and ready to enter anytime. Russia denies any military presence, although it does not rule out the possibility that Russian volunteer fighters may be operating inside the country. Numerous reports from foreign, Ukrainian and even Russian journalists dispute the Kremlin’s assertions. They say that Russian military units are indeed fighting in east Ukraine. Faced with this situation, Ukrainian government officials and the public at large are enthusiastic about the news that the U.S. is considering arming the country. Scared for its future, post-revolutionary Ukraine wants a stable flow of Western military support, including lethal weapons. Many in Ukraine believe this is only this way to save the country from total occupation by Russia. But let’s get real. Nuclear Russia spends 50 times more on its army annually than Ukraine does, and it has about four times more soldiers and six times as many military aircraft. It could take over Ukraine in a matter of days. Kiev is just 120 miles from the Russian border. And although nobody knows for sure what’s inside Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mind, the occupation of Ukraine is not on the table, at least not yet. Instead, it looks like a covert invasion of east Ukraine suits Russia much more: it keeps Ukraine on the verge of collapsing, robbing the country and its potential investors of any sense of stability, without using the military might required for a full invasion. Arming Ukraine will not fix the country’s huge military imbalance with Russia. Unless, of course, Western allies are ready to shell out 70 billion per year. That’s what it would take to match Russia’s military. Finding that kind of cash is unlikely. Ukraine is having a hard time getting the estimated 15 billion it needs to avoid default this year. Importantly, a war-fatigued United States, which is preparing for presidential elections in 2016, would scarcely seem to be open to military involvement in yet another country. At the same time, solving the problem is a lot more complex that simply providing Ukraine with weapons. The country is ravaged by corruption, and its political system and economy is in shambles. Any military support would have to be conditional upon effective reforms. Without that, arming Ukraine would be irresponsible — it would be no different to giving a gun to a crook. The Ukrainian army, too, is widely considered to be plagued by corruption and incompetence. It is also reportedly infiltrated by Russian intelligence. This might be why, despite a strong patriotic rally for the push against Russia, there have been reports of rising numbers of Ukrainians avoiding the draft. Ukraine’s leaders have acknowledged the problem and have pledged to clean up the nation’s military. We can give the Ukrainian government credit for that. Still, after almost 25 years of a near kleptocracy, this could take years. War isn’t helping. So far, there are no indications that there is any timetable for a potential U.S. arms drop to Ukraine, let alone that the United States in indeed serious about doing so. The State Department could just be testing the waters or trying to scare Russia off from advancing further. If that’s the case, it’s unlikely that will work either. Have you checked the Russian media lately? The most popular story making the rounds right now (and also the most hilarious example of Russian propaganda) is about Putin being “able to finish NATO with just one phone-call.” Indeed, harsher rhetoric will only help Putin in rallying more domestic support for his agenda, as it will strengthen his claim that the West is interfering in Ukraine. The Russian leader will undoubtedly use military threats from the West to support his position that NATO countries are aggressors, trying to suffocate Russia by expanding militarily on its border. There are only two ways to stop Russia’s attempt to control Ukraine by stealth. Strengthen Ukraine by pressuring the government to introduce much-needed reforms. Effective anti-corruption measures need to be introduced now that will make obsolete the remnants of Ukraine’s kleptocracy. General distrust and frustration with crooks on every level of the Ukrainian bureaucracy was one of the main sources of secessionist sentiments in eastern Ukrainian provinces. Russia has exploited this all too well. At the same time, the West should continue bringing pressure to bear on Russia through its economic sanctions — if it wants to get tougher on Russia, it can always ramp these up. There are plenty of sensible, and effective, measures the West could support to help the situation. Providing more guns and ammunition in this volatile part of the world is not one of them.

After searching for a good, tough crime reporter, he appoints Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) as a foreign correspondent, under the pen name \\"Huntley Haverstock\\".The reporter's first assignment is Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), leader of the Universal Peace Party, at a party held by Fisher in honor of a diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Bassermann). On the way to the party, Haverstock sees Van Meer entering the car which is to take him to the party, and runs to interview him; Van Meer invites him to ride along. At the party, Haverstock meets Fisher's daughter, Carol (Laraine Day). Van Meer disappears mysteriously. Later, Fisher informs the guests that Van Meer, who was supposed to be the guest of honor, will not be attending the party; instead he will be at a political conference in Amsterdam.At the conference, Van Meer is shot in front of a large crowd by a man disguised as a photographer. Haverstock commandeers a car to follow the assassin's getaway car.

Summarize this article: Most toddlers will eat a variety of fruits, so try incorporating them into the daily diet as breakfast and snacks. Use vegetables in every lunch and dinner, and set a good example for your child by eating vegetables yourself as well. Children should have regular sources of lean protein, such as yogurt, fish, chicken, and some whole grains. Work within your child’s preferences but make it clear that protein is an important part of mealtime. Toddlers need fresh, healthful food to achieve and maintain an appropriate weight. If your child often eats take-out or packaged foods packed with fat, salt, sugar, and other non-nutritive ingredients, swap them out for carrot sticks, applesauce, strawberry slices, string cheese, and Cheerios. Toddlers need about half the calories of adults, so size portions accordingly. Try dividing the plate into segments: 1/2 vegetables and/or fruits, 1/4 whole grains, and 1/4 lean protein. Many toddlers love to drink fruit juices, but these are often loaded with calories and limited in nutritional value. If your child drinks a lot of fruit juice (or any other sweetened drink), swap it out for milk or water. Juice, soda, and other sweetened drinks can add hundreds of calories to your toddler’s diet each day. Do not give your toddler drinks that serve as dietary supplements, such as PediaSure. These drinks are formulated for children with difficulty gaining weight or with restrictive diets. If your child eats well and is overweight, avoid high-calorie toddler drinks of this nature.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of providing toddlers with a nutritious and balanced diet to maintain a healthy weight. To achieve this, it suggests incorporating a variety of fruits in their daily meals as breakfast and snacks, and using vegetables for lunch and dinner. Parents should set a good example by eating vegetables themselves. Lean protein from yogurt, fish, chicken, and whole grains should also be a regular part of children's diet. It is essential to work within the child's preferences while stressing the importance of protein intake. Furthermore, it is vital to replace unhealthy, high-fat, and sugar-packed take-out or packaged foods with healthier options like carrot sticks, applesauce, strawberry slices, string cheese, and Cheerios. Since toddlers require half the calories of adults, portions should be sized accordingly. A recommended way to portion the plate is to have half of it filled with vegetables and/or fruits, a quarter with whole grains, and the remaining quarter with lean protein. The article also addresses the consumption of fruit juices, which are often high in calories and limited in nutritional value. It advises swapping fruit juices and other sweetened drinks for milk or water, as these sugary beverages can contribute significantly to a toddler's calorie intake. Additionally, it warns against providing dietary supplement drinks meant for children with issues gaining weight or restrictive diets, such as PediaSure. Overweight children who consume a balanced diet should avoid such high-calorie drinks. In summary, maintaining a healthy weight for toddlers is crucial and can be achieved through a balanced diet with appropriate portion sizes and replacing unhealthy options with nutritionally dense foods and drinks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Game of Thrones fans were promised cheaper access to the show by Foxtel but the hit drama is not included in the new subscription deal to win over more customers and reduce illegal downloads. Foxtel customers now pay 45 instead of 74 to access drama, sport and movies. However, the minimum cost to buy into a pay-TV package which will deliver Game Of Thrones at the same time as it airs in the US along with a host of HBO quality shows is 45. Previously it would have cost viewers a minimum of 74 to access the series. However, considering Australians set a world record for file sharing downloads - with more than one million accessing the show last season - the question begs is the reduced subscription enough to stop fans from illegally downloading? According to file sharing monitor TorrentFreak, Australia is the only country in the world to reach double digit downloads of the show with 11.6 per cent of GoT downloads originating here. Despite the show being a massive success - Foxtel only managed to hit the 115,000-175,000 viewers range - technically fewer viewers than for Peppa Pig on Sunday mornings. Making Game Of Thrones cheaper to watch is not the sole reason behind Foxtel's revised pricing structure but it is the reference point for comparing the old subscription scale to the new one. Foxtel CEO Richard Freudenstein said there has already been a positive response to their new pay structure. There will also be more HD channels and the launch of an upgraded IQ box to allow viewers to watch shows that have been screened in the previous 24 hours.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the name of the work whose core approaches a five-movement symphony with the chorale finale? Answer the above question based on the context below: A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum.

Question: What is the name of Tyler's two children? Title: The Fourth Kind Movie plot: Chapman University hosts a televised interview with psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler (Milla Jovovich/Charlotte Milchard). She tells a story of a close encounter incident at Nome, Alaska, in October 2000. In August 2000, Tyler's husband, Will, is mysteriously murdered one night in his sleep, leaving her to raise their two children, Ashley (Mia Mckenna-Bruce) and Ronnie (Raphael Coleman). Tyler tapes hypnotherapy sessions with three patients who have the same experience: every night a white owl stares at them through their windows. Tyler hypnotizes two of them, and both recount similar terrifying stories of creatures attempting to enter their homes. Tommy Fisher (Corey Johnson), her first patient to go under hypnosis, refuses to admit what he sees and returns home. Later that night, Abbey is called by the police to Tommy's house, where she finds him holding his wife and their two children at gunpoint. He insists that he remembers everything and keeps asking what \\"Zimabu Eter\\" means. Despite Abbey's attempts to get Tommy to put his gun down, he shoots his family and turns the gun on himself. After hearing the similarities in the accounts of nightly occurrences, Abbey suspects these patients may have been victims of a non-human kidnapping. There is evidence that she herself may have been abducted, when an Assistant gives her a tape recorder, which plays her voice and the sound of something with a distorted electronic voice entering her home and attacking her. It speaks in an unknown tongue; Abbey, though, has no memory of it. Dr. Abel Campos (Elias Koteas), a colleague from Anchorage, is suspicious of the claims. Later, Tyler calls upon Dr. Awolowa Odusami (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a specialist in ancient languages who was a contact of her late husband, to identify the mysterious language on the tape. Odusami identifies it as Sumerian. Another, more willing patient named Scott (Enzo Cilenti) wishes to communicate.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. As with other retinal surgeries, you will be required to abstain from eating or drinking anything for between two and eight hours before the procedure. You may also be instructed to use eye drops to dilate the pupils before surgery. In a vitrectomy, your doctor will remove the vitreous fluid from inside the eyeball, and will remove any tissue that may be preventing the retina from healing. Your doctor will then fill the eye with air, gas, or liquid to replace the vitreous, allowing the retina to reattach and heal. This procedure is the most commonly-performed type of retinal surgery. Over time, the substance (air, gas, or liquid) your doctor injected is absorbed by the eye, and your body will produce fluid that will fill the vitreous cavity. If your doctor used silicone oil, however, he will need to surgically remove the oil after several months have passed and the eye has healed. After a vitrectomy, your doctor will send you home with specific care instructions for your eye to help ensure a full recovery. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully, and ask him if you're uncertain of what to do. Your doctor may instruct you to: Take a pain reliever, like acetaminophen Use prescription-strength eye drops or ointments After a vitrectomy, most patients are instructed to keep the head stable in a specific position. This is known as \\"posturing,\\" and it is vital to allow the bubble to settle into the correct position. It can also be helpful in maintaining the eye's shape after surgery. Follow your doctor's instructions on posturing to allow the retina to heal. Do not travel by airplane until the gas bubble is fully absorbed. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to fly again. Having gas bubbles in the eye may cause complications in other surgeries. Let your doctor know about the gas bubbles before any subsequent surgeries, and before being administered general anesthetic, especially nitrous oxide. Your doctor may give you an eye box to help your eye heal. He will instruct you on how to use the eye box, and will let you know how long to continue using it. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling any eye equipment. Soak cotton balls in the prescribed eyewash solution. Loosen any crust that may have formed on your eye, then wipe gently from the inside of your eye across to the outside. If you are treating both eyes, use separate cotton balls for each eye. Your doctor may give you an eye patch and an eye shield to help your eye heal. These tools will help you protect your eye while sleeping and whenever you are outdoors. Wear the eye shield for at least a week, or for as long as your doctor instructs you to continue use. The eyepatch will help protect your eye from bright lights, like the sun, and will help prevent dirt and debris from entering your healing eye.

The key scientists acknowledged for their significant contributions to the understanding of the electrical properties of nerve cells in the first half of the 20th century are Sir Alan Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Huxley. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley conducted a series of groundbreaking experiments primarily on the giant axons of squid at the University of Cambridge, England, in the early 1940s and thereafter. While their work was interrupted by World War II, they resumed their research in the late 1940s which continued into the 1950s. Using an innovative voltage-clamping technique, they were able to ascertain that the nerve impulse (called an action potential) that travels along nerve cells, or neurons, was due to the sequential activation and then inactivation of ion channels through which sodium and potassium ions flow across the nerve cell's membrane. Rapid influx of sodium ions leads to the initial depolarization of the membrane, followed by the repolarization phase involving the outflow of potassium ions. By developing complex mathematical equations to describe the ionic movements involved, they were able to elucidate the mechanism of the action potential. Their findings provided remarkable insights into the electrical properties of nerve cells, and hence, they established the 'Hodgkin-Huxley model' of nerve impulse propagation. Further, they also introduced the concept of membrane potential and described the role of resting potential and threshold potential in the generation of an action potential. In recognition of their phenomenal contributions, Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963, shared with John Eccles for his work on synapse physiology. Though Charles Sherrington made significant contributions to neurophysiology, especially in the area of reflexes and the concept of synaptic communication, his work didn't directly address the question asked, which is about the electrical properties of nerve cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities. These can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted. The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union, especially with regard to sovereign debt as a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, are designed to insure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation. What should no assets offered up as collateral be? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The question appears to be asking what characteristics or requirements should disqualify assets from being offered up as collateral in the context of the European Central Bank (ECB) auctions. In order to ensure the stability of the financial system and the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policy instruments, assets offered as collateral must meet certain minimum standards. Assets that do not meet these criteria should not be accepted as collateral. Here are some key factors that may render an asset unsuitable for collateral: 1. Low credit quality: Collateral should have a sufficient level of credit quality to ensure that the risk of default is minimized. Assets with low credit ratings or those issued by entities with poor creditworthiness should not be accepted as collateral. 2. Illiquidity: Collateral should be easily tradable in the market, and there should be a readily available market price for the asset. Assets that are not easily tradable or lack an active secondary market may not be suitable as collateral since they might be difficult to liquidate in case of default. 3. Legal issues: Assets should be free from legal disputes or encumbrances that may hinder their use as collateral. Assets with unresolved legal issues or those that have restrictions on their transferability should not be accepted as collateral. 4. Concentration risk: The ECB aims to ensure that the collateral pool is well diversified to minimize risk. If an asset represents a significant concentration in a particular issuer, sector, or geography, it may not be suitable as collateral to maintain a diverse and balanced pool. 5. Maturity mismatch: Assets offered as collateral should have a maturity profile that matches the maturity of the credit provided by the ECB. Offering assets with very short or very long maturity might not be suitable, as this could create refinancing risks for the borrowing bank. 6. Inflation risk: To protect against inflation risk, collateral should be denominated in currencies that have stable inflation rates. Assets denominated in currencies with high inflation risk or volatile exchange rates may not be suitable as collateral. 7. Non-compliance with EU requirements: Assets should comply with EU membership requirements and any applicable regulations. Assets issued by entities that do not meet the European Union's or ECB's guidelines might not be accepted as collateral. In conclusion, no assets offered up as collateral should have low credit quality, illiquidity, legal issues, high concentration risk, maturity mismatch, significant inflation risk, or non-compliance with EU requirements. Such assets would not meet the minimum criteria necessary for effectively participating in the ECB auctions and ensuring the stability of the financial system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Reactions and Compounds of Nitrogen Like carbon, nitrogen has four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p), so it can participate in at most four electron-pair bonds by using sp3 hybrid orbitals. Unlike carbon, however, nitrogen does not form long chains because of repulsive interactions between lone pairs of electrons on adjacent atoms. These interactions become important at the shorter internuclear distances encountered with the smaller, second-period elements of groups 15, 16, and 17. (For more information on internuclear distance, see Chapter 7 \\"The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends\\", Section 7.2 \\"Sizes of Atoms and Ions\\" and Chapter 8 \\"Ionic versus Covalent Bonding\\", Section 8.2 \\"Ionic Bonding\\". ) Stable compounds with N–N bonds are limited to chains of no more than three N atoms, such as the azide ion (N 3−). Nitrogen is the only pnicogen that normally forms multiple bonds with itself and other second-period elements, using π overlap of adjacent np orbitals. Thus the stable form of elemental nitrogen is N 2, whose N≡N bond is so strong (DN≡N = 942 kJ/mol) compared with the N–N and N=N bonds (DN–N = 167 kJ/mol; DN=N = 418 kJ/mol) that all compounds containing N–N and N=N bonds are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the formation of N2. In fact, the formation of the N≡N bond is so thermodynamically favored that virtually all compounds containing N–N bonds are potentially explosive. Again in contrast to carbon, nitrogen undergoes only two important chemical reactions at room temperature: it reacts with metallic lithium to form lithium nitride, and it is reduced to ammonia by certain microorganisms. (For more information lithium, seeChapter 21 \\"Periodic Trends and the \\". ) At higher temperatures, however, N2 reacts with more electropositive elements, such as those in group 13, to give binary nitrides, which range from covalent to ionic in character. Like the corresponding compounds of carbon, binary compounds of nitrogen with oxygen, hydrogen, or other nonmetals are usually covalent molecular... Q: What is the most electron-pair bonds a nitrogen atom can participate in?

This is because the fact provided states that \\"magnetic attraction pulls two objects together.\\" Magnetic attractions occur between objects made of, or containing, ferromagnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, or cobalt) when aligned in a particular way. The effects of magnetism are observable in everyday life, and it is one of the fundamental forces in physics that acts at a distance, meaning it can pull objects together without them physically touching or without the necessity of a person to interfere. Let's additionally briefly analyze the other possible, but less likely, answer options. (I) the objects are possessed - This option stems more from a belief in the paranormal. It is often touted in supernatural beliefs or horror movies that objects may move without apparent cause due to possession. However, this is not a scientifically or commonly accepted reason for two objects to move closer together. (III) the sun is rising - This seemingly unrelated event wouldn't have a direct impact on the movement or proximity of two objects on Earth. Although the sun's gravitational pull affects the Earth, there's no discernible way it would make nearby objects come closer together. (IV) all of these - Because options (I) and (III) are not likely answers based on the scenario and explanation given, it would be incorrect to assume that all choices are valid explanations.

Exxon CEO Now a Contender for Donald Trump’s Secretary of State President-elect Donald Trump is widening the circle of candidates for secretary of state and will interview more prospects this week, transition officials said, a sign that after multiple meetings with high-profile hopefuls he still isn’t sold on whom he wants as the nation’s top diplomat. Though Mr. Trump’s transition team said last week that the search had narrowed to four finalists, new candidates have emerged, including Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp. , one transition adviser said. Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump for an interview this week. Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing Sunday on NBC, said the list of secretary of state candidates “might grow a little bit.” On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump’s transition officials said another candidate for both secretary of state and energy secretary is Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.). The conservative Democrat would add a bipartisan dimension to the Trump cabinet if chosen. Mr. Manchin has experience in both realms, serving on the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Armed Services Committee. His office didn’t respond to a request for comment. And U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R., Calif.) said in an interview Sunday he is talking to Trump transition officials about the secretary of state job. He said he has pitched to them an arrangement in which he would serve in the top job and a deputy would be John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Bolton—who also is in the running for the secretary of state post—held a private meeting with the president-elect Friday at Trump Tower. Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, told reporters Sunday: “It is true that he’s broadened the search…He’s very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women who, all of whom need to understand that their first responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president-elect’s America First foreign policy, if you will, his view of the world.” A final decision could come by week’s end, the transition adviser said. Secretary of state is the most prominent missing piece in a national security team that is quickly taking shape. At a rally in Cincinnati last week, Mr. Trump announced he selected retired Gen. James Mattis to head the Pentagon as defense secretary. He has tapped another retired general, Michael Flynn, to serve as his national security adviser. Normally an opaque process, the hunt for the next secretary of state has played out in an unusually public fashion. Another top candidate is 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump had dinner with Mr. Romney in Manhattan. Setting aside the campaign hostilities and perhaps trying to make amends with Mr. Trump’s supporters, Mr. Romney told reporters afterward that he was “impressed” with the transition effort. Other candidates for the job are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s most loyal campaign supporters; U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who also met with Mr. Trump in New York on Tuesday; and retired Gen. David Petraeus, director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration. Gen. Petraeus pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material in a case involving his biographer, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. He addressed his legal troubles in an appearance Sunday on ABC, saying, “I made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it. Folks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.” One of the questions Mr. Trump faces is whether he wants a trifecta of generals as his core national security team. That would be the upshot if he picks Mr. Petraeus. Coming to the presidency with no foreign policy or government experience, Mr. Trump could rely more heavily on his national security team than his predecessors. So far he has chosen to largely freestyle his engagement with foreign leaders, rather than rely on the State Department’s guidance for such conversations. Mr. Trump sent shock waves through the diplomatic community Friday when he spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the first conversation between a U.S. president-elect, or president, and the leader of Taiwan since 1979. The conversation ran against Beijing’s efforts to block formal U.S. relations with the island off China’s coast, which it has long considered a Chinese territory and not a sovereign nation. Choosing a secretary of state with scant foreign policy background, such as Exxon’s Mr. Tillerson, could further unnerve government officials serving in an institution that functions on strict protocols. Mr. Trump also faces a decision on whether he wants a more hawkish foreign policy or one favoring diplomacy over military engagement. During the campaign, he signaled that he wants a military posture that is less interventionist, eschewing “nation-building” and “regime-change.” Yet he has vowed to intensify military action against Islamic State. “The balance of personalities in the [White House] Situation Room is really important. It’s one of the few places where all the parts of government come together to shape foreign policy and presidential decision making,” said Phil Carter, director of the Military, Veterans and Society Program at the Center for a New American Security, a bipartisan think tank. “They have to bring their personalities and their judgment to the table,” Mr. Carter said. “Who you have in that room and in that decision process can have a big impact.” Mr. Tillerson, 64 years old, grew up in Texas and joined Exxon in 1975. He leads a company with operations in more than 50 countries, from Canada to Papua New Guinea, that often exerts itself abroad with the sweep of a sovereign nation. He is slated to retire next year and Exxon has identified Darren Woods as a successor. As Exxon’s CEO since 2006, Mr. Tillerson could leverage existing relationships with numerous world leaders, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had dealings for more than a decade. Mr. Tillerson’s close ties to the company, including tens of millions of dollars of Exxon shares that will become available to him in the coming decade, could complicate his efforts to lift sanctions or intervene in trade disputes where Exxon has a financial interest. It would be almost impossible for him to recuse himself from working with all the countries in which Exxon operates or markets products. Mr. Tillerson’s corporate pedigree would make him an unconventional choice, foreign policy analysts said. Jon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was a lawyer at a top New York City firm, but not a CEO, and that George Shultz was president of Bechtel Corp., but also served in government. “Both are far, far, far smaller companies than Exxon Mobil,” Mr. Alterman said. “I can’t think of a CEO with no government experience becoming secretary of state.” As head of a company with a massive global footprint, Mr. Tillerson, though, is no stranger to foreign leaders. As Exxon’s chief executive, he has spoken against sanctions on Russia, where the company in 2012 signed a 3.2 billion deal that Mr. Putin said could eventually reach 500 billion in investments. “We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,” Mr. Tillerson said at the company’s annual meeting in May 2014. Mr. Tillerson has some of the closest ties among U.S. CEOs to Mr. Putin and Russia, with his work there dating back to when Mr. Putin rose to power after Boris Yeltsin’s resignation. The 2012 deal gave Exxon access to prized arctic resources. Later that year, the Kremlin bestowed the country’s Order of Friendship on the American businessman. Mr. Tillerson supported a Trump rival in the Republican primaries: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He gave the maximum 2,700 to the Bush campaign, and another 5,000 to the Right to Rise, the super PAC that backed Mr. Bush. He didn’t make a contribution to Mr. Trump’s campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political giving. —Bradley Olson and James V.

Context: Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Galileo recorded Neptune's location in his drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, where he plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who owns a frozen food depot?, using the article: Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing. One of the boys from the cafe agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot to do some investigating there., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"Based on the article provided, it isn't explicitly mentioned who owns the frozen food depot. However, since Anne visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and discovers that his account is unconvincing, and one of the boys from the café agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot, it can be reasonably inferred that Taplow is likely the owner of the frozen food depot. The story revolves primarily around the investigation of Harry Jukes' case and his alleged shooting of a policeman. Anne Dyson becomes involved due to her background in working with troubled young people and her doubt about the police evidence. Anne's exploration leads her to Taplow, the man whose Bentley Continental was stolen by Harry. During her interactions with Taplow and her inquiries into his frozen food depot, it becomes increasingly clear that there are unanswered questions and potential connections to the broader story of Harry's case. Although the owner of the frozen food depot is not the primary focus of the article, it is from the context and connections drawn by Anne that we can assume Taplow is the likely owner. Further investigations into his background, associations, and potential involvement in Harry's case could reveal more information and help determine the truth behind the events in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Recognizing the Telltale Signs of Poison Ivy Exposure: The Itchy Red Rash Line and Beyond Introduction Poison ivy, scientifically known as Toxicodendron radicans, is a widespread plant across North America known for causing skin irritation when touched. It is crucial for everyone, especially those who enjoy spending time outdoors, to be able to identify the symptoms of poison ivy exposure. This is to ensure that proper measures can be taken to prevent severe irritation and help facilitate a swift recovery. This article will discuss the signs you should look for after coming into contact with poison ivy, including an itchy, red rash line, splotches, blisters, and swelling. The Itchy Red Rash Line One of the primary indicators that you have come into contact with poison ivy is the telltale itchy, red rash line that typically appears and becomes more noticeable within 24-48 hours of exposure. This rash may begin as individual patches or streaks and often becomes more continuous, linear, and raised as time passes. As your body reacts to the exposure, the rash will often develop into an extremely itchy, inflamed, and uncomfortable line. Although the line's appearance and intensity may vary from person to person, this sign should not be ignored, as it is a strong indication that the individual has come into contact with poison ivy or other similar toxic plants. Splotches and Contamination from Pets or Items Another essential sign to look for is rash splotches caused by indirect contact with the poisonous plant. If you have held a contaminated object or touched a pet that has come into contact with poison ivy, you may develop a rash in the form of splotches. These splotches may be smaller and more localized than the rash line mentioned earlier, but they should not be underestimated as they can also be incredibly itchy and uncomfortable. To minimize exposure risk, it is essential to clean your pets and objects after they have been in areas where poison ivy is present. Blisters and Swelling Around the Affected Area Besides the itchy rash line and splotches, your skin can also develop blisters if you come into contact with poison ivy. These blisters may form as your body's immune response to the exposure and can range from small to large in size. Additionally, they can fill with fluid and may rupture, increasing the chance of infection and delaying the healing process. Swelling around the affected area is also a common symptom of poison ivy exposure. This swelling can be painful, and depending on the location, it could limit the movement of your joint and hinder daily activities. Swelling is another indication that your body is responding to the irritant and trying to rid itself of the harmful substance. Conclusion Recognizing the signs of poison ivy exposure, such as itchy red rash lines, splotches from contaminated pets or items, blisters, and swelling, is vital for anyone who enjoys spending time outdoors. Being aware of these symptoms will allow you to take prompt action in minimizing further discomfort and facilitating a quicker recovery. If you suspect you have come into contact with poison ivy, consult a healthcare professional for advice on how to treat the affected area effectively. Additionally, educate yourself on how to avoid poison ivy and other similar plants while spending time outdoors to decrease your risk of exposure in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to find a compromise, they both decided to sit down and discuss their options so that each person would feel comfortable with the chosen attire. Step 1: Assessing the occasion Firstly, they considered the type of event they were attending. It was an informal gathering at a local lounge, where friends would catch up and enjoy some drinks. Kenneth expressed his desire to make a good impression, while Christopher wanted to maintain a laid-back vibe. Step 2: Sharing personal style preferences Kenneth explained his love for suits and ties, as they made him feel confident and sophisticated. Christopher, on the other hand, preferred wearing jeans and t-shirts, believing that comfort was essential for him to enjoy the night. Step 3: Considering each other's feelings Both individuals acknowledged the importance of feeling comfortable in their outfits. Kenneth recognized that Christopher might feel out of place in formal wear, and Christopher understood that Kenneth wanted to dress up to boost his confidence. Step 4: Finding a middle ground Taking into account both personal preferences and the occasion, they settled on a compromise: semi-formal attire. This way, Kenneth could still wear a stylish blazer and dress pants, while Christopher would don a button-up shirt paired with his favorite jeans. Step 5: Finalizing the outfits and accessorizing Once the middle ground was established, they selected their outfits and chose complementary accessories. Kenneth opted for a navy blazer, crisp white shirt, and tailored dress pants, accessorized with a pocket square and a stylish watch. Christopher picked out a chambray button-up shirt, dark-wash jeans, and polished his casual look with a brown leather belt and some comfortable dress shoes. Step 6: Enjoying the night With their wardrobe dilemma resolved, Kenneth and Christopher felt more confident and comfortable in their chosen attire. As they arrived at the local lounge, they received compliments from their friends and enjoyed the night, knowing they had respected each other's preferences and found the perfect balance between style and ease."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Being that my wife and I are both Korean, we know what good Korean food is, and QQ grill so far has our thumbs up! I ate a special off menu dish called Dolsut Bibimbap. It is a Korean style fried rice made with beef bulgogi (thinly sliced marinated beef), vegetables (Korean style spinach, bean sprouts, zucchini, carrots to name a few), spicy Kochujang (chili pepper) sauce on the side that you mix to taste (depending how spicy you like stuff), and it all comes in a sizzling hot clay pot. Becareful that pot is HOT! It was delicious and authentic.

Which group would less likely engage in visually intensive works, group A or group B? David is a doctor who works for the public health department. After analyzing health data for his city, he found twenty percent of the population have myopia. He categorized them as group A. Another eighty percent didn't have myopia. He put them in group B. He now needs to devise a plan on how to tackle myopia in his city. Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Answer:","completion":"Group B would be less likely to engage in visually intensive works. This is because group A consists of individuals who already have myopia, and as the hint suggests, nearsightedness is often associated with spending a lot of time on visually intensive activities such as reading, working on a computer, or doing other close visual work.

Set in Albuquerque, the series followed the life of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the beginning of the first series. In order to secure his family's future before he dies, he turned to a life of crime, making and selling methamphetamine. Reviews in the UK and US have been generally favourable - but reveal several key plot points. Walt may have ruined his own family and the lives of several others. And yet, in that climactic final half hour, he somehow won back a measure of both sympathy and respect - not least by surrendering the pretence that he'd done it all for his family. \\"I did it for me,\\" he told Skyler, at last. \\"I liked it. I was good at it.\\" Of course, the thing he was good at was not carpentry, nor teaching - though I seem to recall he wasn't too shabby at that - but cooking meth and whacking folks. So in the end, he got what he deserved. Read the full review here Perhaps the best thing about the finale of Breaking Bad is that it actually ended. So many shows, notably The Sopranos and Lost, have gone dark without anything approaching finality. Here, the writers were so determined to not leave unfinished business that the last episode was called Felina, an anagram of finale. And almost every loose end was tied. In some cases, a little too tightly, and in others, not quite as much. Breaking Bad brilliantly tracked Walt's transformation from teacher to criminal mastermind. But it's still a mystery why that talented chemist turned his back on fame and fortune and became a humble high school chemistry teacher. Read the full review here Written and filmed at a time when Breaking Bad was already a phenomenon, this finale has been under a huge amount of pressure from a fan base that's taken ownership of the story in a way that few TV shows manage. But fear not, they've pulled it off marvellously. In a single episode, they've packed in all of those disparate ingredients that have made Breaking Bad such a joy. There's action, violence and tension, but also humour, warmth and wonderfully quiet moments that carry so much weight. Read the full review here The final episode of Breaking Bad... had a lot of business to take care of in a short time. [It] was a kind of machine gun of narrative, knocking down all of those questions with auto-fire efficiency. (Well, almost all.) It was not flashy. It wasn't structurally ambitious, in the way other Breaking Bad episodes have been. It was not, in most respects, surprising. And that's OK. Because what Felina was - as effective, satisfying series finales are - was true. It was true to the five seasons that preceded it, true to Walter White's obsessions and pride, and true to what Breaking Bad is at heart: A Western. As in the song El Paso, the protagonist (I'm not going to say hero) rode back to town, faced his enemies, said his goodbyes, and died. A Western is meant to go out with a bang, and Breaking Bad went out with about 40 of them per second (plus a dose of ricin). Read the full review here Like all big-talker shows that bring their heavy cargo in for a rough and breathlessly observed landing, Breaking Bad didn't quite leave itself enough runway to satisfactorily end some of its better story lines, especially once the chronology gap closed up between the flash-forwards from last year's episodes and Sunday night's conclusion. One could easily argue that there was just too much left to do in this one episode. As a critic, I have to finally face the fact that my favourite series (possibly ever - I'd have to think long and hard about that) is now gone. And when trying to figure out why this show worked so well, so deeply for me, I keep coming back to one simple and not terribly profound idea: Breaking Bad was original. Read the full review here Not only did Vince Gilligan's five-season, hyper-violent prose poem to midlife male frustration tie up virtually every loose end in sight, it contained the Holy Grail of all storytelling: an Actual Moment of Truth. And not just this particular story's truth, but one that extended to the beloved and bloated genre Gilligan both elevated and mocked. \\"I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really ... I was alive.\\" The strongest moments of the final season came as Walt realised that great truism so often underscored in stories like his: Once you introduce evil into your life, you cannot control it. In the end, though, Walter White was triumphant. His money would go to his children, his enemies were dead, his foster son freed. Read the full review here As final episodes go, this delivered everything that has been great about Breaking Bad. It had tension, pathos, brutality, emotion, humour, jaw-dropping shocks - but also resolution. Like so much of Felina, the end was satisfying because of its simplicity. Really, we've known from the start how it would end. Walt's going to die. A show that sentences its lead character to death in the first episode is duty bound to deliver that promise by the end. Read the full review here In today's hyper-caffeinated age, precious little lives up to its hype. But the Breaking Bad finale - perhaps appropriately - got the chemistry just right... Sunday's finale made eminently clear, this was a show whose narrative fearlessness was only matched by its boundless creativity and unpredictability. The 75-minute finale written and directed by (Vince) Gilligan perfectly capped a final arc that was all forward momentum, with barely an ounce of fat on it, and almost nary a false note. Read the full review here In a stunning 75-minute extended finale, Vince Gilligan brought Breaking Bad to a supremely fitting close, tying up all the loose ends in his modern classic AMC series and killing off his now iconic anti-hero Walter White. And he did so in a way that confirmed Bad's status as one of TV's greatest series - and star Bryan Cranston as one of America's best actors. Tense, witty, violent, oddly tender and, in its own strange way, as close to a \\"happy\\" ending as a story this dark could hope, this last episode brought the story to a straightforward, definitive conclusion, without the spirituality of Lost or the ambiguity of Sopranos. Read the full review here There was a lot of closure in Breaking Bad. You can say that Gilligan gave most of the viewers what they wanted (and, impressively, he did that by staying true to himself and the story without selling out or becoming unrecognisably saccharine as he tied the bow). This finale certainly wrapped up things - mostly - in a bow. It had similar strains to the shots that The Wire used and was nearly as effectively tidy as Six Feet Under was in spelling out the fate of those involved. More than anything I love a creator's ability to end the story as he or she wishes. That doesn't make every decision acceptable. The finale to Dexter was an embarrassing, ham-fisted disaster. But the finale to Breaking Bad - even if it wasn't what I'd hoped would happen - was more than enough to thrill me and make me appreciate five seasons and six years of brilliant work. What an outstanding achievement.

Please briefly summarize this news article: NHOF: Wallace Happily Surprised By Selection In a hotly debated election day, no one was more surprised to be voted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame than 1989 Sprint Cup champion Rusty Wallace. Wallace joined Herb Thomas, Leonard Wood, Cotton Owens and Buck Baker in making it into the 2013 NASCAR Hall of Fame class. Wallace certainly has the resume. His 55 Cup race victories rank him ninth all time, with the eight ahead of him all either already in the NASCAR Hall or still active and therefore ineligible. What was surprising, though — or at least surprising to Wallace — was that he made it in during his first year of eligibility. Of the others, Thomas and Baker had been on the list of finalists since the inaugural class of 2010, with Owens and Wood first nominated for the 2012 class. But 2013 is Wallace’s first year of eligibility and he made it in the first time. “All I can tell you is I’m glad to get in, and I didn’t expect to get in in the first round,” said Wallace. “There’s huge names — I honestly didn’t.” Wallace was so wound up before the event he said he left the NASCAR Hall briefly prior to the announcement. “I left a little while ago and I went down to the Ritz-Carlton and had a glass of wine just to calm down, ‘cause I didn’t know what I was going to say.” Understandably, Wallace was emotional about being selected. “I’m totally humbled, I really am,” he said. “I’m blowed away.

They are debating between getting a dog or a cat when they decide to flip a coin since they can't agree. The coin comes up tails so they are getting a cat. Unbeknownst to Karen, she is allergic to cats. Kelly has no allergies to animals, but Karen has never lived with cats before so she isn't aware that she is allergic to them. Who will have a stuffy nose more often? Hint: An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen . Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. The answer is:","completion":"Karen will have a stuffy nose more often since she is allergic to cats. Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to a harmless substance (allergen), such as cat dander, as if it were harmful. In Karen's case, living with a cat will expose her to cat allergens, which will trigger an inflammatory response in her body, causing allergy symptoms like a stuffy nose, sneezing, or itchy eyes. On the other hand, Kelly has no allergies to animals, so she is not likely to experience a stuffy nose or any other allergy-related symptoms due to the presence of a cat in the apartment. In this situation, Karen would be advised to visit an allergist to confirm her allergy and discuss potential treatments or alternatives to living with a cat, such as adopting a hypoallergenic pet if possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their marriage is not helped by Clara's opinionated mother living with them in their small one bedroom apartment. However, Clara does wish that their life would be a little more exciting as Andrew said on their honeymoon that their married life would be, least of all by Andrew acknowledging their latest wedding anniversary, their fifth. Clara's wish takes an unexpected turn when Andrew, at work, is assigned to show the visiting Mr. Battingcourt Jr. - the younger half of the head of their London office and who is majority shareholder of their accounting firm - a good time while he's in the US. \\"Batty\\" as he is affectionately called by his friends is a party animal, and Andrew, who Batty rechristens \\"Hinky\\", feels he has to party along all in the name of job security.

A: Answer:","completion":"Veins are the blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The primary function of veins is to transport deoxygenated blood from various parts of the body back to the heart so that it can be reoxygenated and circulated again. Veins are a critical component of the cardiovascular system, working in conjunction with the heart, arteries, and capillaries to ensure proper blood circulation throughout the body. Veins are distinct from arteries in their structure and function. Arteries have thicker, more muscular walls and carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins have thinner walls and carry deoxygenated blood. Veins also contain one-way valves that prevent the backflow of blood, ensuring that deoxygenated blood moves in the correct direction towards the heart. There are three primary types of veins: 1. Superficial veins These veins are located just beneath the skin's surface and are often visible, particularly when they dilate or become varicose. They help collect deoxygenated blood from the capillaries in the skin and transport it to deep veins. 2. Deep veins As the name suggests, deep veins are found deep within the body, usually parallel to arteries. They carry the majority of the blood being returned to the heart and are not usually visible. Deep veins are often located within the muscles, which assist in blood flow by contracting and applying pressure to the veins. 3. Pulmonary veins These veins are unique as they carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the heart. This is different from other veins in the body as they typically carry deoxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins play an essential role in the pulmonary circulation, which is responsible for oxygenating the blood. The process of returning deoxygenated blood to the heart begins at the capillaries, where oxygen and nutrients are exchanged between the blood and the body's tissues. The deoxygenated blood then flows into the small venules, which merge to form larger veins. This blood eventually makes its way to the largest veins in the body, such as the superior and inferior vena cava, which return the blood to the heart. From there, the blood is pumped to the lungs to become oxygenated once again. In conclusion, veins play a vital role in the circulatory system by carrying deoxygenated blood (with the exception of pulmonary veins carrying oxygenated blood from the lungs) from various parts of the body back to the heart. The specific structure and function of veins, including their thinner walls and one-way valves, facilitate this crucial process and help maintain proper blood circulation throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.

If I tell you that Changes in the DNA information are essential for evolution to occur, and ask you the question \\"what is essential for evolution to occur?\\", is the correct answer \\"human interference\\"? Answer:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"human interference.\\" It is true that changes in the DNA information, or genetic variations, are essential for evolution to occur. In fact, they form the basis of genetic diversity, which allows species to adapt to varying environmental conditions and to develop new traits and characteristics over time. While human interference can impact evolution in particular instances, it is not essential for evolution to occur. Evolution is a natural process that occurs through the mechanisms of mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Let's examine these elements in more detail: 1. Mutations: Mutations are random changes in an organism's genetic material (DNA). They can introduce novel genetic variations and are the source of new genetic information. Some mutations may be harmful, while others may have little to no impact, and some may even be beneficial to the organism. Over time, mutations with a favorable impact are more likely to be passed on to future generations. 2. Gene flow: When individuals from different populations of the same species interbreed, they exchange genetic material, leading to the spread of new genetic variations among populations. This gene flow can help maintain genetic diversity within species and facilitate the process of adaptation to different environments. 3. Genetic drift: This mechanism represents the random fluctuations of gene frequencies within populations. Genetic drift can lead to the loss of genetic variation in small populations, which can hinder evolution. Yet, in some cases, it may promote the fixation of unique genetic variations within isolated populations, driving the emergence of distinct subspecies or species. 4. Natural selection: Arguably the most critical factor in the evolutionary process, natural selection refers to the differential survival and reproduction of organisms based on their inherited genetic traits. Those with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce; consequently, these advantageous genetic traits become more prevalent in subsequent generations. While human interference in the context of anthropogenic pressures like pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction can indeed impact, both positively and negatively, the process of evolution, it is not inherently necessary for evolution to take place. Evolution is an inherent part of life that has driven the diversification and adaptation of species for billions of years, long before human civilization ever emerged. In conclusion, while human interference can produce effects on evolutionary processes, it is not essential for evolution to occur. The essential factors for evolution to occur are instead genetic variation (through mechanisms like mutations, gene flow, and genetic drift) and natural selection acting upon these variations over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: If you choose a title that sounds like it belongs in one genre while the actual content of the story belongs in another, you’ll not only confuse potential readers, you may alienate them. For example, if your title sounds distinctly fantasy-esque, like “The Dragon of the Old Tower,” but the story is in fact about modern-day brokers on Wall Street, you’ll alienate those who pick up your story looking for fantasy and you’ll miss entirely those looking for a story about something modern or about the world of elite finance, etc. In the majority of cases, titles that are brief but impactful are more successful than those that are long and difficult to remember. For example, “A Man Discovers the Perils of a Solo Trek Through the Yukon” is likely less compelling to potential readers than “To Build a Fire,” which is shorter and more imaginative. Titles that use poetic language, vivid imagery, or a bit of mystery tend to be alluring to potential readers. Poetic language in a title, like “A Rose for Emily” or Gone with the Wind, draws readers with an elegant turn of phrase that promises an equally poetic story or writing style. Titles that evoke vivid imagery appeal to readers because they conjure something tangible and meaningful. A title like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, though long, creates an immediate and vivid image that conjures an idea of a battle between good and evil. Imbuing your title with a bit of mystery can also draw readers in. A title like Something Wicked This Way Comes (also an allusion from Macbeth) or “The Black Cat” give just enough information to raise questions that will pull the reader into the story. Though alliteration--the repetition of successive sounds at the beginning of words--can make a title catchier or more memorable, it can also make it sound trite or hokey if not done well. Subtle alliteration, like I Capture the Castle or The Count of Monte Cristo, can add appeal to a title. Obvious or forced alliteration, on the other hand--like \\"The Guileless Guide of Gullible Gus\\" or \\"The Especially Exciting Endeavors of Elanor Ellis\\"--can easily dissuade a potential reader from picking up your story.","completion":"Choosing a title that accurately reflects the genre of your story is crucial to avoid confusing or alienating readers.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

Fangio's grandfather, Giuseppe Fangio, emigrated to Buenos Aires from Italy in 1887. Giuseppe managed to buy his own farm near Balcarce within three years by making charcoal from tree branches. His father, Loreto, emigrated to Argentina from the small central Italian town of Castiglione Messer Marino in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region. His mother, Herminia Deramo, was from Tornareccio, slightly to the north. The Batista Dictatorship of Cuba established the non-Formula One Cuban Grand Prix in 1957. Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during practice for the 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two unmasked gunmen of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio at gunpoint. The motive was simple: By capturing the biggest name in motorsport the rebels were showing up the government and attracting worldwide publicity to their cause. But despite the shocking news spreading across the globe, President Batista would not be outdone and ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at intersections, and guards were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers. Fangio was taken to three separate houses. His captors allowed him to listen to the race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of Stockholm Syndrome, admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: \\"Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it.\\" Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards. The captors motives were to force the cancellation of the race in an attempt to embarrass the Batista regime. After Fangio was handed over to the Argentine embassy soon after the race, many Cubans were convinced that Batista was losing his power because he failed to track the captors down. The Cuban Revolution concluded in January 1959, cancelling the 1959 Cuban Grand Prix. The Fangio kidnapping was dramatized in a 1999 Argentine film directed by Alberto Lecchi, Operacion Fangio.

U.S. airlines are world-beaters when it comes to finding creative ways to boost baggage fees, onboard food sales and other revenues that aren't rolled into airfares, financial data show.United, American and Delta led global carriers in collecting ancillary revenues in 2009, according to a new study by airline consultancy IdeaWorks and Amadeus, a giant clearinghouse for airline transactions.Airlines worldwide collected 13.5 billion in 2009, a 43 percent jump from 2008 totals, according to the study of financial filings made by 96 airlines.Chicago-based United Airlines generated the greatest fee income of any carrier in the world: 1.9 billion in ancillary revenues last year, the study found. That's about double the 963 million in fees pocketed by Australia's Qantas Airways , the highest-ranking overseas carrier in the study.The proliferation of checked bag fees in the U.S. and much of Europe accounted for the startling jump in this source of airline revenue, said Jay Sorensen, president of Wisconsin -based IdeaWorks.Every major U.S. carrier except Southwest Airlines rolled out luggage fees during 2008 in an effort to boost revenues to offset skyrocketing oil prices and a later collapse in business travel that followed Wall Street's historic meltdown.Although most large airlines are finally profitable for the first time in three years, they aren't inclined to rescind the controversial charges.In fact, baggage fees are expected to spread around the world. \\"The fees are here to stay,\\" Sorensen said.United President John Tague caused a stir during the carrier's earnings call Tuesday, when he suggested the carrier could reap greater income from passenger fees.\\"I don't think we're very far along, frankly,\\" Tague said. \\"That might be surprising to people given where we are in terms of ancillary revenue generation.\\"Only about 40 percent of United passengers pay to check bags, generating 350 million to 450 million annually for the nation's third-largest carrier. But Tague said United's annual baggage revenues could top 1 billion over time, as carriers in regions like Asia adopt similar charges.\\"It appears that the trend is firmly in place, and that over time more and more bags will be assessed fees,\\" he added.Bags aren't the only area where airlines are striking gold.Carriers gain money through customers who join their affinity card programs, and also are commanding greater commissions on hotel rooms and rental-car services packaged along with airfares on their Web sites. They're also experimenting with new, upgraded onboard meals. And they're selling passengers one-day access to priority security lines and lounges once reserved for first-class customers.The fee frenzy has caught the attention of lawmakers such as Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., and prompted the Transportation Department to propose rules making airline pricing and fees more transparent so that passengers don't suffer sticker shock when costs are added up.Though the fees annoy some travelers who long for the days when airlines provided full service at no added cost, the new environment could be a boon for deal-seekers, Sorensen said.\\"In the future, if the consumer wants to squeeze travel costs down to next to nothing, he or she will buy online, maybe pay with a debit card, won't have an assigned seat, bring a snack from home and will have a carry-on,\\" he predicted. \\"Anyone who wants a different experience will pay more.\\" ||||| Continental Airlines announced second quarter earnings of 233 million this morning, rounding out a strong earnings season for airline companies.

It is rumored that, deep within the wilderness, an ancient species known as the Tasmanian Tiger is alive and breeding. Yet, modern science refuses to believe such a creature now exists, since no witnesses have ever been able to prove it. That is, until zoology student Nina (Mirrah Foulkes), claims she can breach Tasmania's impenetrable forests and confirm the tigers' existence. Driving Nina's quest is one critical piece of proof: a photo of a paw print taken by her sister just before she met with a fatal accident eight years before.In the early 19th century, the murderous convict Alexander Pearce (aka \\"The Pieman\\") had broken out of prison twice, and each time he had killed and eaten his fellow escapees. But what Nina doesn't know is that, before he was hung for cannibalism in 1824, he'd spawned a blood line who inherited his taste for human flesh. Soon, Nina and her friends discover that in the wild, as one species may have died out, another has thrived---in the form of the Pieman's descendants. When she sets out with her partner, Matt (Leigh Whannell), his old mate, Jack (Nathan Phillips), and his girlfriend, Rebecca (Melanie Vallejo), their little expedition encounters the island's reigning breed, but one who stands on two legs, not four. The Pieman clan has survived, and their need to feed and breed turns Nina, Matt, Jack and Rebecca into this island's next endangered species.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: In what year did the band member who was depressed attempt to announce a break up of the band at the end of a concert? The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

We can break down the key elements of each sentence to emphasize their similarities: 1. Both sentences mention the context, which is the independence of Armenia in 1991. 2. Both sentences communicate that Ijevan became the provincial center. 3. Both sentences reference the establishment of a new province, Tavush (or Tavush Province). 4. Both sentences note that the change took place because of the administrative reforms in 1995. With these similarities in mind, let's analyze the differences between the two sentences. The first sentence: \\"Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Ijevan became the provincial centre of the newly founded province of Tavush, following the administrative reforms of 1995.\\" In this sentence, 'following the administrative reforms of 1995' is placed at the end, separated by a comma. This arrangement emphasizes the connection between the administrative reforms of 1995 and Ijevan becoming the provincial center. The second sentence: \\"Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Ijevan became the provincial centre of the newly founded Tavush Province as per the administrative reforms of 1995.\\" In this version, 'as per the administrative reforms of 1995' is integrated within the sentence, thereby connecting the administrative reforms to Ijevan becoming the provincial center more explicitly. Additionally, the province's name is written as \\"Tavush Province\\" instead of \\"province of Tavush\\". To summarize, although there are slight differences in phrasing and structure, the two sentences mean the same thing. Both describe the event of Ijevan becoming the provincial center of the newly founded Tavush Province due to the administrative reforms of 1995, which took place after Armenia gained independence in 1991."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the season opener for both teams, this game held immense importance for setting the tone for the rest of the season. Duke University, being ranked No. 11, entered the game with high expectations and the pressure to maintain their national ranking. On the other hand, the University of Tennessee at Martin, being the underdogs, aimed to make a statement by putting up a strong fight against a top college basketball team. JJ Redick and Daniel Ewing, two stars from Duke, were expected to have impressive performances in the game. Both players lived up to the expectations and scored 20 points each, effectively becoming the backbone of Duke's offense. Their scoring abilities coupled with their strong teamwork allowed Duke to create a considerable lead and dominate the game. The first half of the game was fairly competitive, with both teams exchanging baskets and showcasing their offensive skills. However, Duke's vast experience and pedigree shone through as they turned up the defensive pressure in the second half. This strategic move proved to be the turning point for Duke as it heavily disrupted Tennessee-Martin's offensive rhythm and hindered their ability to score points. By prioritizing their defense, Duke was able to control the game's tempo and gradually build a comfortable lead over Tennessee-Martin. Moreover, their defensive strategy resulted in numerous turnovers, which Duke converted into easy points through fast breaks and efficient offensive plays. This shift in Duke's approach transformed the close contest into a one-sided affair eventually leading to the lopsided 88-46 scoreline. Ultimately, Duke's victory in their season opener demonstrated their ability to adapt their game plan when needed. The impressive performances by JJ Redick and Daniel Ewing contributed to a solid team effort that allowed Duke to maintain control of the game. Meanwhile, Tennessee-Martin gained valuable insight and experience from playing against a highly-ranked opponent, which could be applied in their future games throughout the season. In conclusion, the basketball game between Duke University and Tennessee-Martin showcased an intense battle that ultimately saw Duke emerge victorious with an 88-46 score. The significant contributions of JJ Redick and Daniel Ewing, as well as Duke's strategic focus on defense in the second half, played crucial roles in securing their win on this memorable Saturday night in Durham, NC. This season opener set the stage for the rest of the season, where Duke would strive to maintain their high-ranking position and Tennessee-Martin would continue to challenge their opponents in search of their own success story."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How is \\"I am.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"I am.\\" can be translated as \\"Jsem.\\" Czech language, like many other Slavic languages, has a highly inflected structure, which means that the meaning and function of words can change based on their endings and position in the sentence. In this case, \\"Jsem\\" is the first person singular form of the verb \\"být,\\" which means \\"to be\\" and does not require the use of a separate pronoun in the sentence since the verb form \\"jsem\\" already indicates that the subject is the speaker or the first person singular. However, if you want to include the pronoun for emphasis, you can say \\"Já jsem,\\" where \\"Já\\" is the Czech pronoun for \\"I.\\" It is important to note that \\"Jsem\\" can be used on its own when the context is clear or when answering a question, but in general, it is followed by an adjective, noun, or complement to express the specific state or condition of the speaker. For example: - Jsem šťastný (I am happy) - Jsem učitel (I am a teacher) - Jsem v Praze (I am in Prague) Additionally, when it comes to negation, the adverb \\"ne\\" is placed before the verb in order to change the meaning to \\"I am not\\" or in Czech, \\"Nejsem.\\" For example: - Nejsem unavený (I am not tired) - Nejsem student (I am not a student) - Nejsem doma (I am not at home) In conclusion, to say \\"I am.\\" in Czech, you can use the word \\"Jsem,\\" and if you want to include the pronoun for emphasis, you can say \\"Já jsem.\\" Remember that the full meaning of the sentence usually comes from adding an adjective, noun, or complement to describe the state or condition of the speaker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What cause indian language to be abandoned in schools\\" is in \\"Orientalist scholars of the 18th century like Sir William Jones marked a wave of enthusiasm for Indian culture and for Sanskrit. According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \\"Indomania\\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \\"British Indophobia\\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a \\"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\\".\\".

Answer:","completion":"The cause for Indian languages to be abandoned in schools can be traced back to the early 19th century Britain, where a growing hostility towards Sanskrit and Indian culture started developing.

Scientific racism: A theory based on the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a separate, inferior, and unimprovable race.

Fact1: Thiruthani beating up men Thiruthani rushed toward the men who were tormenting his sister. His heart filled with rage, he beat up each of them one after another, until they were all lying helplessly on the ground.

Monica shared her own experiences with body image issues and opened up about the different strategies that helped her overcome those negative thoughts.

The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: \\"I persist in finding in [the score] the rarest virtues\\".

Martin Luther became severely ill and visited his friend during Christmas in 1545. Jonas was present at Luther's deathbed at Eisleben, and preached the funeral sermon; in a procession Luther's body was taken to Halle and buried in Wittenberg. In the same year Jonas was banished from the duchy by Maurice, Duke of Saxony. From that time until his death, Jonas was unable to secure a satisfactory living. He wandered from place to place preaching, and finally went to Eisfeld, Thuringia , where he died, aged 62.

Martin Luther had visited his friend, Jonas, in Halle during Christmas in 1545, where he became severely ill. After Luther's death in Eisleben, Jonas, who was present at Luther's deathbed, preached the funeral sermon. Then in a procession, Luther's body was transported to Halle. It was from Halle that his remains were then taken to their final resting place in Wittenberg. This journey designated the final stages of the commemoration and farewell to the significant theologian and seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. The decision to bury him in Wittenberg symbolizes the deep connection between Luther and that city, where much of his theological work and the initiation of the Reformation movement took place. His influence was profound both during his life and after his death, and his burial in Wittenberg stands as a continuing testament to his profound impact on the city and on Christianity as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Elgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in Elgin, Moray, north-east Scotland. The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in... answer the following question: What were the two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow? Answer:","completion":"The two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow were clerics and craftsmen. As the Cathedral went through different periods of enlargement, renovation, and rebuilding following the fires and attacks, there was an increasing necessity for more clerics to staff the evolving religious institution. Clerics were responsible for performing religious duties, managing the Cathedral's affairs, and supporting the spiritual needs of the community. At the same time, there was also a growing demand for a larger number of craftsmen required to maintain the buildings and their surroundings. Craftsmen were essential to the construction, repair, and artistic embellishment of the Cathedral throughout its history. They would have included skilled workers such as stonemasons, carpenters, glaziers, and other artisans who were necessary for the maintenance and beautification of the Cathedral complex. Overall, the increasing number of clerics and craftsmen at the Elgin Cathedral reflected the growing importance and complexity of the institution, as well as the successive stages of construction and restoration that it underwent throughout its history. The constant evolution and rebuilding shaped the Cathedral into the historical and architectural landmark that it remains today, despite its ruined state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Honey bees are normally about third fourths of an inch long. Most bees are workers, which are female, but some are male, called \\"drones \\". Workers are a little smaller than drones. Honey bees live in a nest, called a \\"hive\\". A hive can have up to 80,000 bees, mostly workers. It usually lies in a tree with a hole inside. The hive is ruled over by a queen bee. She is the largest bee in the hive, and she is the only female to mate. Males usually just hang around; their only purpose is to mate with the queen. Then they die. The workers do all of the work inside and outside of the hive. Their jobs include: caring for baby bees, cleaning up the hive, making honey...

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","completion":"The proposition suggests an additional amount of \\"space rock\\" coming in, which in terms of geological processes, could mean either the rock below the soil is increasing in volume, or perhaps there is more rock being deposited on the surface which will eventually become subterranean. Let's consider both scenarios for further understanding. Scenario 1: If the rock below the soil is expanding or increasing in volume, this would have a direct impact on the process of cave formation. This could be considered as 'directly impacting a step of the process'. Expanding rock mass could disrupt the slow process of carving out caves by potentially filling in it or blocking water routes, slowing the erosion process that broadens the cave. Over time, the rock expansion could potentially lead to less cavernous structures below the earth's surface. Scenario 2: If more rock is being deposited on the surface, the immediate impact on the cave formation process is indirect. This would represent 'indirectly impacting a step of the process'. Over time, deposition leads to an increase in overburden pressure on the underlying rock layers, which eventually could lead to an increased rate of seepage and possibly even a faster rate of erosion due to heightened water pressure. Depending on the type of deposited rock, it might also alter the chemical composition of the infiltrating water - with potential implications for the dissolution process. In both scenarios, the presence of additional space rock could perturb the process steps. The effect is either direct, by altering the existing structure in the rock, or indirect, by potentially altering the speed and nature of the water seepage and erosion process. Therefore, the 'supposed perturbation' in both cases is definitely not 'not impacting any step of the process' since the addition of space rock, irrespective of the spatial arrangement, affects the cave formation process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
