The empire had managed to control nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but in 1402 the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when the Turco-Mongol leader Timur, founder of the Timurid Empire, invaded Anatolia from the east. In the Battle of Ankara in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan Bayezid I as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The ensuing civil war lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: Are jobs obsolete? New technologies are wreaking havoc on employment figures -- from EZpasses ousting toll collectors to Google-controlled self-driving automobiles rendering taxicab drivers obsolete. Every new computer program is basically doing some task that a person used to do. But the computer usually does it faster, more accurately, for less money, and without any health insurance costs. We like to believe that the appropriate response is to train humans for higher level work. Instead of collecting tolls, the trained worker will fix and program toll-collecting robots. But it never really works out that way, since not as many people are needed to make the robots as the robots replace. And so the president goes on television telling us that the big issue of our time is jobs, jobs, jobs -- as if the reason to build high-speed rails and fix bridges is to put people back to work. But it seems to me there's something backwards in that logic. I find myself wondering if we may be accepting a premise that deserves to be questioned. I am afraid to even ask this, but since when is unemployment really a problem? I understand we all want paychecks -- or at least money. We want food, shelter, clothing, and all the things that money buys us. But do we all really want jobs? We're living in an economy where productivity is no longer the goal, employment is. That's because, on a very fundamental level, we have pretty much everything we need. America is productive enough that it could probably shelter, feed, educate, and even provide health care for its entire population with just a fraction of us actually working.","completion":"The article raises the question of whether jobs are becoming obsolete due to the rapid advancement of technology and the impact it has on employment figures. New technologies like EZpasses and self-driving cars are taking over tasks that were once performed by humans, often with greater efficiency, accuracy, and at a lower cost. The common belief is that people can be trained for higher-level work to adapt to this shift, such as programming the very robots which replace human labor. However, this solution is not always practical, as fewer people are required to create and maintain these technologies than the number of jobs they replace. The author argues that the focus on jobs as the main solution for economic stability might be misguided. Society clings to the idea that jobs are essential, but the real need is for a stable income and access to essential services. The article points out that the United States has the resources to support its population with necessities such as shelter, food, education, and healthcare even with a fraction of the population working. This perspective challenges the notion that unemployment is a problem that needs to be rectified solely through job creation. The key issue is not the lack of jobs, but the need for a system where everyone can have access to essential services and financial security, regardless of whether they are employed in a traditional job. The article prompts us to rethink our priorities and consider if productivity should be the driving force behind the economy, rather than full employment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

India lead five-match series 1-0 following 95-run victory at Lord's. Third Test begins at the Rose Bowl in Hampshire on Sunday. Article:","completion":"Title: Jadeja's Incident With Anderson and ICC's Decision: A Look Into the Ongoing Controversy In recent news, an incident involving Ravindra Jadeja and James Anderson has taken center stage in the cricket world. The event in question took place at Trent Bridge on July 10, during the first Test match between England and India in the five-match Test series. This on-field clash has led to Jadeja being found guilty by the International Cricket Council (ICC) of 'conduct contrary to the spirit of the game', while Anderson awaits his verdict, scheduled to be announced in an ICC hearing slated for August 1. As the drama unfolds and fans eagerly anticipate further updates, India leads the series 1-0 following an impressive 95-run victory at Lord's. The Rose Bowl in Hampshire will host the third Test match, which is set to commence on Sunday. The incident at the core of this saga has been shrouded in speculations and controversies, causing a divide in the cricket fraternity as it raises questions about sportsmanship and rules governing player conduct. According to sources, a verbal altercation between Jadeja and Anderson escalated into a physical confrontation on that fateful day at Trent Bridge. While specific details about the confrontation remain unclear, it is known that Jadeja faced accusations of turning, walking towards Anderson, and threatening to hurt him with his bat. On the other hand, Anderson stands accused of pushing Jadeja as the confrontation intensified. After conducting a thorough investigation into the matter, the ICC found Jadeja guilty of 'conduct contrary to the spirit of the game' and imposed a 50% match fee fine on him. This verdict has sparked intense debates about fairness and appropriate measures for addressing such incidents. Critics argue that the ICC's decision is biased and unfavorable towards Jadeja, especially considering that Anderson's fate is yet to be determined. They further contend that the punishment meted out to Jadeja is too harsh, and that the ICC should have adopted a more lenient approach towards the altercation. The upcoming ICC hearing on August 1 will reveal whether Anderson too will be punished for his alleged involvement in the incident. Depending on the outcome of the hearing, this development could lead to further discussions on the adequacy and consistency of the ICC's disciplinary measures. As the spotlight remains on Jadeja and Anderson, it is crucial to ensure that the spirit of the game is maintained and that any inappropriateness is dealt with tact and fairness. India's 1-0 lead in the five-match series was attained through a remarkable performance at Lord's, where they emerged victorious with a 95-run win. As players and fans look forward to the upcoming third Test at the Rose Bowl in Hampshire, it is hoped that the sporting excitement remains the focal point, and that the emphasis is placed on both team's exceptional talent, determination, and grit, rather than the recent controversies embroiling the cricket world. In conclusion, as the Jadeja-Anderson debacle unfolds and the possibility of further punishments looms, ensuring the sanctity of sportsmanship and adherence to laid-down regulations is vital for the continued success of the cricketing contest. Alongside the unfolding drama, India's lead in the series is poised to pique interest and maintain the excitement surrounding the face-off. With discussions around the Jadeja-Anderson incident set to continue in the near future, we can only hope that the love and respect for the game remains untarnished, and that the upcoming matches are remembered for their skill and competitiveness, rather than any off-field controversies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- A surprise appearance by WikiLeaks.org founder Julian Assange at the TED Global conference in Oxford, England, has cast new light on the activities of the site and its mysterious leader. Assange's site, which released video of a U.S. air strike in Iraq that killed a dozen civilians, claims to have revealed more classified intelligence documents than the rest of the world's media combined. Explaining during his appearance Friday why WikiLeaks has been keeping a lower profile since releasing the video, Assange said it was working on raising funds and strengthening its technical infrastructure to handle more traffic while accumulating \\"an enormous quantity of whistle-blower disclosures.\\" He said","completion":"the disclosures, which come from various sources around the world, expose several instances of government misconduct, corporate fraud, and human rights violations that would otherwise remain hidden from the public eye. While addressing the conference, Assange emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in today's globalized society, stressing the need for organizations like WikiLeaks to serve as a countermeasure against the abuse of power. Assange also mentioned that WikiLeaks has faced multiple legal, financial, and technical challenges since its inception in 2006, which has only strengthened its resolve to continue exposing the truth. He highlighted the attacks on the website's infrastructure, aggressive attempts to uncover the identities of its sources, and continuous threats to its funding as some of the hurdles they are constantly battling. Furthermore, Assange called upon the TED Global audience to recognize the vital role played by whistle-blowers in ensuring that powerful entities are held accountable for their actions. He argued that these courageous individuals should be protected and celebrated, rather than vilified and prosecuted, for their dedication to truth and justice. During his discussion, Assange presented an overview of some of the most significant leaks published on the site, including the horrific collateral damage exposed by the Iraq air strike video, the Afghan War Diary, and the diplomatic cables leaked by former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These releases have not only shaped public opinion about modern warfare, diplomacy, and the use of information technology to dictate global events but also sparked significant policy changes and debates on international topics. Additionally, Assange provided insight into the organization's unique operational principles and the development of its technical infrastructure.

Article: Ever thought of moving to a new country? How about starting a new country? Patri Friedman is planning to do just that. He left Google years ago to set up the Seasteading Institute. And his dream is to build seasteads-----floating micro-nations in the middle of the ocean. So, what will life on a seastead be like? Probably a bit like life on a cruise liner , but much larger, with shops, gyms, swimming pools, schools and other areas. In fact, the early seasteads may actually be specially-rebuilt cruise liners. But as science advances, Friedman believes they'll become more like floating cities, with several hundred people. Seasteading raises a lot of questions. First of all, how will the new countries make money? The Seasteading Institute has suggested several money-making ideas, including ocean-based theme parks, casinos and fish farming. There's also the questions of safety. With storms, typhoons and pirates , the high seas are a dangerous place. However, the Institute says that it can stand bad weather and prevent crimes with its well-designed systems. So, is this just a day dream? Well, maybe not. One of the people behind the project is Peter Thiel. He founded PayPal and was one of the first investors in Facebook. So far, he's donated 500,000 to the project. And Friedman isn't wasting any time. He recently announced the creation of the Poseidon Award. This will be given to the first seastead with fifty people. Friedman is hoping to hand out the award in 2015.

Summarize this article: According to the Department of Health, every time someone fails to turn up for a hospital appointment it costs the health service about £108. Newly published hospital statistics show that about 147,500 patients did not keep their appointments last year. Those patients also failed to alert staff in advance that they would not attend, meaning resources were wasted. Considering £1m could employ 35 full-time nurses, or allow 150 people to have their hip operation, health service commissioners would argue that the public should be more responsible. The statistics also show there was a slight rise in the number of outpatient appointments being cancelled by hospitals. A Department of Health spokesperson called on the health board and health trusts to do all they can to minimise the level of appointments cancelled by consultants. There has also been a notable increase in the number of people being admitted to hospitals in Northern Ireland. Since 2011, admissions are up by 4.3% or more than 25,000 people. In spite of the increase, there are almost 700 fewer hospital beds across the system.

When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower.

Multiple scenes were filmed in Austria, including a night-time car chase, an airplane crash, and an expansive action sequence that involved a lot of state-of-the-art gadgetry and vehicles, which is a signature element in James Bond films. The filming in Austria was demanding and required detailed preparation and planning, due to the extreme weather conditions and complex action sequences. The crew had to work in freezing temperatures, and the actors performed physically challenging action scenes. When the Austrian filming schedule wrapped up in February 2015, production then moved on to other locations, including Morocco, Mexico, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Ultimately, the film was released in London on October 26, 2015, with a worldwide release following in November of the same year. Thus, the statement that filming for \\"Spectre\\" in Austria concluded in February 2015 is correct. It was a significant part of the global production process, which resulted in a James Bond film that was praised for its action sequences, performances, and Mendes's direction, though it also faced some criticism for its length and narrative approach compared to the film's predecessor, \\"Skyfall\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It may suggest that the exchange give up its regulatory powers . It has no jurisdiction over his pay but does oversee the exchange 's regulatory powers . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, the two sentences are not paraphrases of each other. Paraphrasing essentially means expressing the same idea or message using different words in order to make the meaning clearer or to provide variety in expression. It involves changing the form of words while keeping the core idea intact. The first sentence, \\"It may suggest that the exchange give up its regulatory powers,\\" implies that there is a suggestion or proposal that a certain entity known as the exchange should relinquish its regulatory powers, or in simpler terms, its authority to regulate something. In this scenario, the focus is on the potential relinquishment or cessation of the exchange’s regulatory powers. On the other hand, the second sentence states, \\"It has no jurisdiction over his pay but does oversee the exchange's regulatory powers.\\" Here, it's mentioned that 'it' has no control or jurisdiction over someone's pay, but does have some form of control or oversight over the regulatory powers of the exchange. This sentence differs greatly from the first, because it discusses two distinct actions: one relating to the control over someone's pay and the other to the oversight of the exchange's regulatory powers. Hence, both sentences handle different ideas and are not paraphrases of each other. While the subject matter or topic (the exchange's regulatory powers) is common in both sentences, the context, meaning, and phrasing are vastly different. In conclusion: 1. The first sentence speaks about a suggestion for the exchange to surrender its regulatory powers. 2. The second sentence speaks about 'it' having no control over someone's pay, but having oversight of the exchange's regulatory powers. There is neither a similar description of an event or a condition in these two situations, nor do they express identical sentiments or meanings in different words. Therefore, they don't qualify as paraphrases of each other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Surely no Saturday morning TV kids' show was ever done this poorly. After all, those producers had to count on the audience coming back. Well, in this awful offering, they could at least count the money they saved on sets. The script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial, with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude Gerald Mohr to murmur to Naura Hayden. No director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline, so the action just plods boringly along. The spaceship props are absurd--a Bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history. Most are crude drawings, and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light. Even Mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop. And it's a bad one--as rib-thin as the plot. Any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the Martians--and will probably agree completely!","completion":"This review has a negative sentiment.

We have this math problem: 0 = -5*p + 1515 - 1550. We need to find the value of p, okay? First, let's begin by simplifying the equation a little bit. We see two numbers, 1515 and 1550. If we subtract 1550 from 1515, we get -35. So, after combining these numbers, our equation now looks like this: 0 = -5*p - 35 Now, we want to get rid of the -35. To do that, we can add 35 to both sides of the equation. When we do that, we have: 35 = -5*p Next, we want to find the value of p. Right now, we see that p is being multiplied by -5. To undo that multiplication, we can divide both sides of the equation by -5. When we do that, we get: p = 35 / -5 Now, we just need to solve this last equation. When we divide 35 by -5, we find that p equals -7. So, the solution is p = -7. Good job solving the math problem with me!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"The arrivals before 1850 were mostly farmers who sought out the most productive land, where their intensive farming techniques would pay off.\\" be a reasonable answer? OPTIONS: [+] No. [+] Yes. The answer is:","completion":"Yes, \\"The arrivals before 1850 were mostly farmers who sought out the most productive land, where their intensive farming techniques would pay off\\" is a reasonable answer. However, it is important to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response to understand the life of immigrant Germans in America fully. Life for German immigrants in America during the 19th century was marked by both opportunities and challenges. Germans began immigrating to the United States in large numbers during the 1830s and 1840s due to economic hardships, political unrest, and social tensions in their homeland. The majority of these immigrants were farmers, skilled craftsmen, and laborers who sought to build a better life for themselves and their families. As mentioned in the prompt, German farmers who arrived before 1850 tended to settle in areas where fertile land was available. These farmers were known for their intensive farming techniques, which allowed them to maximize crop production. German immigrants often chose locations such as the Midwest (particularly states like Wisconsin, Illinois, and Missouri) and Texas, as these regions offered the best agricultural opportunities. German immigrants faced a variety of challenges upon arriving in America, including adjusting to a new language, culture, and legal system. These early settlers often formed close-knit communities, where they established German-language schools, churches, and social clubs. These institutions helped preserve their cultural heritage and provided a support network for new arrivals. Integration into American society varied among German immigrants. Many maintained strong ties to their homeland and continued to speak German at home, while others embraced American customs and language. Despite these varying degrees of assimilation, German immigrants made significant contributions to American society during this period. They played a vital role in the development of agriculture, their skilled craftsmanship in various trades such as woodworking and brewing, and their strong work ethic and emphasis on education. Additionally, German immigrants made a significant impact on American culture, as they introduced customs like the Christmas tree, new musical styles like polka and waltz, and various culinary traditions like sauerkraut and pretzels. The influence of German immigrants can still be seen today in the numerous Oktoberfest celebrations held throughout the United States. In summary, life for German immigrants in America during the 1800s was centered around seeking opportunities for better livelihoods and land, adjusting to a new culture, and maintaining their cultural heritage. The arrivals before 1850 were indeed mostly farmers who sought out the most productive land, where their intensive farming techniques would pay off. Throughout their journey, German immigrants made a lasting impact on American society and culture through their contributions to agriculture, various trades, and unique customs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In contrast, Jon Monks of Stylus commented that its shallowness prevents it from ever being called a \\"classic\\".

Pitchfork's Ryan Schreiber suggested that, while the work of the Velvet Underground is an obvious inspiration for the Strokes, the band's only similarity to the other groups is the confidence with which they perform. AllMusic's Heather Phares concluded, \\"Granted, their high-fashion appeal and faultless influences ... have 'critics' darlings' written all over them.

Taxes at all levels of government – local, state and federal – are included.

The premise is that by comparing the benefits received by citizens to the amount they pay in taxes, the value of paying taxes can be assessed. The concept of Tax Freedom Day was developed in 1948 by Florida businessman Dallas Hostetler, who trademarked the phrase \\"Tax Freedom Day\\" and calculated it each year for the next two decades. In 1971, Hostetler retired and transferred the trademark to the Tax Foundation.

Breistroff, a Harvard graduate, was a professional hockey player with a promising career. Snow worked for a hedge fund in New York City. On July 17, 1996, their lives changed forever. Breistroff boarded TWA Flight 800 bound for his native France on his way to Germany to play professional hockey. \\"He called me, and he told me he was getting on the plane. And he asked me to marry him on the phone before he got on the plane,\\" Snow told CNN the next day. Twelve minutes after takeoff from JFK Airport, the plane exploded in midair off the coast of Long Island. Two hundred thirty passengers were on board. No one survived. \\"After we said our final 'I love yous' ... about two hours later, my mom called,\\" Snow recalled recently. \\"She said, 'Please tell me that Michel didn't go to Paris tonight.'\\" Snow immediately turned on the TV. \\"I just remember fire and really dark water. And at that point, my life stood still,\\" she said. \\"He was strong, he was young, and he definitely swam to shore. And I held on to that hope. And then the next morning it became a recovery mission.\\" About five weeks later, Snow's greatest fear was confirmed when Breistroff's remains were recovered from the bottom of the ocean. \\"One of the hardest things for me was just going home,\\" she said. \\"Everybody is resuming life as normal but I had a huge hole in my heart, and I had a future planned with somebody and that was gone.\\" Snow looked for a support group in New York City but couldn't find one. She spoke with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and he suggested she attend a meeting with families from Pan Am Flight 103, which had exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, eight years earlier. \\"When I walked in the room, it was the first time I didn't have to apologize for my tears.

Snow met a woman who lost her fiancé on the Pan Am flight. \\"She would meet with me and talk with me,\\" Snow said. \\"She is really how I got through it.\\" From there, Snow began pairing up mothers to mothers, siblings to siblings, spouses to spouses -- Pan Am families with TWA families. A few months later, ACCESS was born. ACCESS, short for AirCraft Casualty Emotional Support Services, is a nonprofit bereavement support program for people who have lost loved ones in aviation disasters. \\"We have 250 grief mentors from air disasters dating back to 1958 -- private, military and commercial air disasters,\\" Snow said. \\"This gives people an opportunity to share what they went through with somebody else and also provide hope for them.\\" Most of the trained grief mentors have called in for help in the past, Snow said.

Summarize this article: A reality competition series based on the movie “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” in which Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie starred, is in the works. 3 Ball Entertainment and New Regency, which produced the original 2005 movie, are teaming to develop and produce a reality game-competition version of the feature film. Fittingly, in the vein of secret assassins, details are highly confidential, but the show will feature married couples that compete in a high-octane, high-stakes game that offers a twist on the TV competition format, producers say. The box office hit, which brought in nearly 500 million worldwide, revolved around a married couple (Pitt and Jolie) who discover they are both assassins hired by competing agencies to kill each other. Todd A. Nelson and Brant Pinvidic will serve as exec producers on the series for 3 Ball Entertainment. ||||| There's something about a good game show that just reels us in. Although, we admit, sometimes the guest makes it more than the host. As game shows rose to popularity in the '70s and '80s, a lot of the good ideas for them got taken. And then came the really \\"out there\\" ideas (although in America, we have yet to match the weirdness of the Japanese game show where the guests chew the furniture to see if it's chocolate). If you've never heard of the ones of this list, bless your heart, because you were spared serious awkwardness. 1. Yahtzee Yahtzee is a pretty fun dice game on its own, worth enjoying over a pizza and a few beers. Is it fun to watch people roll dice on a national television show? No. No, it isn't. 2. My Dad is Better Than Your Dad Here was a game where you could win by teaming up with your dad to compete against other father/son teams. The idea wasn't awful, but watching the execution really hurt. 3. Scrabble Scrabble is great when you're playing it. Watching other people play it kind of sucks. Not even Chuck Woolery could save this one. 4. Identity Penn Jilette of Penn and Teller fame took the helm in this game show, which challenged contestants to match 12 strangers to their identities. The capacity for stereotyping was like a giant landmine, which is why we'd guess it only lasted one season. 5. Twenty One Twenty-One, hosted by Maury Povich, was based off the original quiz show of the same name in the 1950s. The show only lasted one season, which left Povich more time for lie detector tests and paternity tests for his talk show. 6. Naked Jungle This UK game show challenged couples to roam through the jungle performing an assault course naked. We don't think further explanation of why this was a bad idea is required. 7. Shafted Another gem from the UK, Shafted was canceled in 2001 after only four episodes. Apparently host Robert Kilroy-Silk's tagline \\"Their fate will be in each other's hands as they decide whether to share or to shaft\\" didn't sit well with people. 8.

Translate to English","completion":"The frequently proposed suggestion for establishing a children's unit within the Commission is one that I find to require clarification, particularly in order to ensure the full utilization of all currently available human resources and financial resources. In this proposal, the idea is to create a specific unit within the Commission that would focus on the well-being, rights, and needs of children. The main objective of this initiative would be to ensure that the European Union policies and legislation take into account the best interests of children, and to create a framework that promotes the overall well-being of children at the regional, national, and international levels. There are several reasons why such a proposal may require further clarification: 1. Existing structures and resources: It is important to evaluate the current resources and structures within the Commission that already deal with children's issues, whether directly or indirectly. This includes assessing human resources, budgetary allocations, and ongoing programs and initiatives that promote children's well-being. By identifying these existing resources, one can determine if the establishment of a separate unit would add value to the current system or simply duplicate ongoing efforts. 2. Cooperation between different departments: Establishing a children's unit within the Commission may require fostering collaboration between multiple departments and agencies, as children's issues often cut across different policy areas, such as education, health, social services, and justice. It may be necessary to clarify the responsibilities and roles of each department in this collaboration and devise a strategy for effective coordination and communication in order to optimize the use of available resources. 3. Budget allocation and cost-effectiveness: Before setting up a new unit, it is essential to assess the potential costs associated with this initiative and determine the most cost-effective way to achieve its objectives. The assessment should include the potential allocation of financial resources to the children's unit and the possible redirection of existing funds from other programs if necessary. This information is crucial in ensuring the sustainability and efficiency of the unit. 4. Identifying objectives and goals: In order to establish a comprehensive and effective children's unit within the Commission, it is crucial to set clear objectives and goals that will guide its work. These objectives should be based on a thorough assessment of the needs and challenges faced by children, as well as an analysis of the current gaps in policies and programs that address these issues. By identifying these objectives and goals, the unit can ensure that its work is focused and purposeful. 5. Monitoring and evaluation: To determine the success of the proposed children's unit, it is important to put in place mechanisms for regular monitoring and evaluation of its work. This should include the setting of benchmark indicators and the periodic assessment of progress towards achieving the unit's objectives and goals. The results of these evaluations can help inform further actions and adjustments needed to ensure the effectiveness of the unit and improve its performance. In conclusion, the idea of establishing a children's unit within the Commission holds significant potential for enhancing the EU's focus on children's well-being and rights. However, to fully utilize the available resources and ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of this initiative, it is crucial to address the abovementioned points and provide a clear and comprehensive framework for the unit's operation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"The introduction and increase of boiler facilities could cause significant impacts on forest formation, both directly and indirectly, as it could alter various environmental conditions and factors necessary for the regular growth and propagation of trees that make up the forests. Directly Impacting a Step of the Process: 1. Air Pollution: The emission of pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter from boiler facilities, could directly impact the health and growth of trees. These pollutants can cause acid rain, which damages the foliage, weakens the trees, and limits their ability to photosynthesize. This can affect the overall tree growth and production of seeds. 2. Water Pollution: The release of harmful chemicals and waste products from the boiler facilities could potentially contaminate the water sources. Contaminated water can impair the growth of trees, limiting nutrient uptake. This may directly impact the overall growth of trees and hinder their ability to produce seeds for new forests to form. 3. Soil Pollution: The emission of pollutants from boilers can also contaminate the soil by increasing the levels of heavy metals and other harmful substances. This may affect the nutrients available in the soil, which could lead to a decrease in growth rates and seed production for many tree species. Indirectly Impacting a Step of the Process: 1. Climate Change: Boilers emit greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. The rise in greenhouse gas concentrations can contribute to climate change, leading to higher temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events. These alterations in climate conditions can indirectly impact forest growth and seed production, as well as seed germination and seedling establishment. 2. Habitat Fragmentation: The construction of boiler facilities can lead to the fragmentation and destruction of habitats. This can indirectly impact the process of forest formation by creating barriers that prevent the successful dispersal of seeds by wind, animals, or other natural means, making it difficult for new forests to establish themselves. 3. Biodiversity Loss: With the introduction and expansion of boiler facilities, local biodiversity may be negatively affected as the balance of the ecosystem is disrupted. Loss of biodiversity could indirectly impact forest growth and seed production, as many tree species rely on various animal and plant species for seed dispersal, pollination, or protection against pests and diseases. In conclusion, the addition of more boilers could directly and indirectly impact the process of forest formation. Direct impacts may include air pollution, water pollution, and soil pollution, while indirect impacts could involve climate change, habitat fragmentation, and biodiversity loss.

A woman who asked Joe Biden a question on gun control during an online debate said yesterday that she found the vice president's reply 'poor advice' and 'sexist.' During the town hall on Tuesday Kate Ernest put to Biden: 'Do you believe that banning certain weapons and high capacity. magazines will mean that law-abiding citizens will then become more of a. target to criminals as we will have no way to sufficiently protect. ourselves?' Biden told Ernest to 'buy a shotgun', advice she felt was dismissive. Scroll down for video. Dismissed: Kate Ernest says she felt Joe Biden was 'sexist' after telling her to and buy a shotgun when she asked him about gun control. When Ernest asked the question, Biden. laughed and said that he has told his wife, Jill Biden: 'Jill, if. there’s ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony, put that. double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.' The vice president claimed that this would deter possible intruders and that homeowners don't need weapons like the AR-15 rifle. 'It’s harder to aim, it’s harder to use, and in fact you don’t need 30 rounds to protect yourself. Buy a shotgun,' Biden advised. Ernest. appeared on Fox News yesterday saying that this was 'poorest advice he. could give anyone' as shotguns only hold two rounds. Advice: The vice president said that he has told his wife, Jill Biden: 'Jill, if there¿s ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony, put that double-barrel shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.' Ernest says that, hypothetically, once Biden's wife gone out into plain sight and fired these two shots, she would then be a 'sitting duck.' The woman then added that the vice president's suggestion 'comes off a little sexist.' 'Like, \\"let me tell you what you need\\" versus, you know, \\"arm yourself or protect yourself in a way that you feel necessary,\\"' Ernest said. As it happens, the vice president's advice could also land his wife behind bars. As reported by US News, in Delaware, where the Bidens live, it is illegal to fire a gun unless the situation is genuinely dangerous. A Delaware Police sergeant told US News that residents are not allowed to shoot trespassers. 'On your property you can't just shoot someone,' he said. 'You have to really feel that your life is being threatened.'","completion":"In a 2013 online town hall debate, a woman named Kate Ernest asked then-US Vice President Joe Biden about his stance on gun control, specifically regarding banning certain weapons and high-capacity magazines. She questioned whether such bans would render law-abiding citizens more susceptible to criminals, as they would not have adequate means to protect themselves. Biden responded by laughing and suggesting that she simply \\"buy a shotgun\\" instead of being concerned about the availability of weapons like the AR-15 rifle. Biden then shared that he had given his wife, Jill Biden, the same advice in the past, recommending that she walk out onto their balcony and fire two shotgun blasts into the air if she ever encountered an issue. He claimed that this action would be enough to deter potential intruders and that, generally, people do not need high-capacity rifles for self-defense. However, Ernest appeared on Fox News and criticized Biden's advice as being poor and even sexist. She argued that a shotgun only holds two rounds, making Jill Biden a \\"sitting duck\\" once she had fired both shots. Furthermore, Ernest felt that Biden's comments had sexist undertones, as he seemed to be mansplaining the best way for her to protect herself. Additionally, it was reported by US News that Biden's advice could potentially land his wife in legal trouble, as it is illegal to fire a gun in Delaware—where the Bidens resided—unless the situation is genuinely dangerous.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.

Until relatively recently, the two states had a troubled relationship because of Northern Ireland and Britain's past in Ireland. In the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, the Republic of Ireland's government made a point of being seen to be neutral. But that is not the case when it comes to this month's vote on a British exit (Brexit) from the EU. While saying it is matter for the British people to decide, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny has made a series of visits to the UK, urging the estimated 400,00 Irish citizens living in Britain to vote to remain in the EU in both countries' interest. \\"Europe will be much stronger with Britain as a fundamental member\\", Mr Kenny said. \\"So it's a vital issue for Europe, it's a vital issue for Britain, but it's also a critical issue for Ireland.\\" Mr Kenny took that message to Ruislip, west London, on the May Bank Holiday weekend, when London was playing his home county Mayo in the All-Ireland Gaelic football championship. Most, though not all, of the emigrant fans present seemed to agree with the taoiseach's assessment. When both states joined what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, the Republic of Ireland was economically dependent on UK trade; it had no choice other than to join, once Britain decided to do so. But that dependency is no longer the case, even though Britain remains the Republic of Ireland's single biggest European trading partner. Currently, it is estimated that more than 1bn euros (Â£793m) in merchandisable or sellable goods travel between the two islands every week. While some say a Brexit would be good news for Dublin's financial services industry, the independent think-tank, the Economic and Social Research Institute, is of the view that, overall, a Brexit would be bad for the Republic of Ireland. Dr Edgar Morgenroth from the ESRI says that such a development would not be catastrophic, but it would be significant. \\"A Brexit would have negative economic implications for the UK and it would also have some negative implications for Ireland,\\" he said. \\"Our analysis suggests that the trade impact on Ireland could be to reduce exports on the merchandisable side by 3%.\\" Then there is the worry about the return of customs posts and a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if there is a Brexit and fears about the political and economic implications of that. Because of all the uncertainty, the vast majority of political parties and politicians in the Republic of Ireland are hoping that the UK electorate votes to stay in the EU. But not everyone. Thomas Pringle, a Independent member of the Irish parliament, representing Donegal, believes the EU is fundamentally flawed, undemocratic and unaccountable. \\"I hope that the British people vote Yes to Brexit on June 23 because if it speeds the break-up of the European Union, I believe that would be a very welcome development for all the citizens of Europe and will allow us on the west coast of Ireland to exercise our own rights to our own fishing resources,\\" Mr Pringle said. Four months after the Republic of Ireland's general election, many residents believe another vote - the UK's Brexit referendum - may turn out out to be as important, if not more so, for people's livelihoods south of the border than their own poll. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The Republic of Ireland has a vested interest in the outcome of the Brexit vote. Historically, the two states had a troubled relationship due to Northern Ireland and Britain's past in Ireland. However, the economic relationship between the UK and the Republic of Ireland has evolved since they both joined the European Economic Community in 1973. Today, over 1 billion euros in goods travel between the two nations every week. While some believe a Brexit could benefit Dublin's financial services industry, numerous potential negative consequences have led the majority of Irish political parties and politicians to hope the UK votes to remain in the EU. Concerns include a reduction in Irish exports by 3% and the possibility of a hard border being established between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with negative political and economic implications. Some Irish politicians argue that a Brexit could be beneficial, citing the perceived flaws in the EU's current structure and the potential to reclaim natural resources, such as fishing rights.

Carpetsandotherfloorcoverings,ofcotton,woven,nottuftedorflocked,ofpileconstruction,notmadeup(excl.Kelem,Schumacks,Karamanieandsimilarhandwovenrugs) Please segment the words:","completion":"Sure, here's the sentence broken down into individual words for better understanding: \\"Carpets and other floor coverings, of cotton, woven, not tufted or flocked, of pile construction, not made up (excl. Kelem, Schumacks, Karamanie and similar hand-woven rugs)\\" This phrase seems to be describing a specific kind of carpet or floor covering. Let's dissect each term: 1. \\"Carpets and other floor coverings\\" - This suggests that what's being talked about could be classified as both a carpet or a floor covering. Carpets often refer to floor coverings that span an entire room while floor covering is a more general term that could include rugs, which cover only a portion of the floor. 2. \\"Of cotton\\" - This is specifying the material the carpet or floor covering is made from, which in this case is cotton. Cotton is a natural fiber that is widely used in textiles due to its durability and softness. 3. \\"Woven\\" - This refers to the manufacturing process, where threads or yarns are interlaced at right angles to form a fabric. In the context of carpets, this likely means it's a woven carpet, which is made on a loom and generally characterized by their strong construction. 4. \\"Not tufted or flocked\\" - Tufting and flocking are both specific manufacturing processes used for making carpets. By specifying \\"not tufted or flocked\\", we know these processes weren't used. 5. \\"Of pile construction\\" - Pile refers to the surface of a carpet or fabric, made up of individual threads standing up. Pile construction indicates the way these threads are arranged and secured. 6. \\"Not made up\\" - Within textile context, \\"made up\\" refers to articles that are constructed and finished, this might imply these carpets or floor coverings are not fully finished or constructed. 7. \\"excl. Kelem, Schumacks, Karamanie and similar hand-woven rugs\\" - This indicates that certain types of rugs (Kelem, Schumacks, and Karamanie, which are specific hand-woven styles of rugs) are excluded from this category. Overall, this phrase is quite specific in the type of floor coverings it's describing: they are woven, cotton, pile-constructed floor coverings that are neither tufted nor flocked nor fully made up, and do not include certain types of hand-woven rugs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Omega Man Context: In 1975, biological warfare between China and Russia kills most of the world's population. U.S. Army Col. Robert Neville, M.D. is a scientist based in Los Angeles. As he begins to succumb to the plague himself, he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering himself immune. By 1977, Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the deserted city of Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \\"The Family\\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal albino mutants. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, some of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if it is possible to duplicate the original vaccine, it would take years to salvage humanity. However, he believes it may be possible to extend his immunity to others by creating a serum from his own body. Neville and Lisa return to Neville's apartment where they begin treating Lisa's brother Richie, who is succumbing to the disease. Neville and Lisa are about to have a romantic evening... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Omega Man,\\" Neville is rescued from nearly being burned at the stake by Lisa and Dutch. Lisa is a woman whom Neville had previously spotted in a department store but dismissed as a hallucination due to his ongoing struggles with his sanity amidst his day-to-day life in the deserted city of Los Angeles. She appears at the just-in-time moment to rescue Neville from his impending doom. Dutch, on the other hand, is a former medical student. Together, Lisa and Dutch are a part of a group of survivors. This group comprises individuals, including children, who have managed to survive the catastrophic effects of the biological warfare between China and Russia due to their relative youth. Although they have some resistance to the plague, they are still vulnerable and at risk of succumbing to the disease and becoming much like The Family, an albino cult of mutants. Upon being rescued, Neville, Lisa, and Dutch form a united front. Neville realizes that, while it seems impossible to recreate the experimental vaccine that rendered him immune due to the time it would take, there might be hope in the creation of a serum from his own body that could extend his immunity to others. They proceed to work together, with Neville and Lisa returning to Neville's fortified apartment to begin treating Lisa's brother Richie - one of their group who is beginning to show signs of succumbing to the disease. Therefore, amidst a world where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to a plague that has turned a majority into nocturnal albino mutants, it is Lisa and Dutch who save Neville from being killed by the members of The Family.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Are there any encryption algorithms designed for quantum computers? What is the importance of an interrupt in a microprocessor? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"No, these questions are not the same. They address two distinct concepts within the field of computer science and technology. The first question pertains to encryption algorithms in the context of quantum computing, while the second question relates to the role of interrupts in microprocessors. Let me explain both topics in detail. 1. Encryption algorithms designed for quantum computers: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the field of cryptography. Because quantum computers can process information differently than classical computers, they are expected to break some of the encryption algorithms that are currently considered secure. This has led researchers to explore quantum-resistant algorithms, which are designed to withstand attacks from both conventional and quantum computers. However, it is important to note that creating encryption algorithms specifically for quantum computers is an ongoing research project and an area of much interest. Some candidate algorithms for post-quantum cryptography include: a) Lattice-based cryptography: It relies on mathematical structures called lattices and focuses on problems like the shortest vector problem (SVP) and the learning with errors (LWE) problem. The security of lattice-based cryptography is believed to be resistant to quantum computer attacks. b) Code-based cryptography: It involves using error-correcting codes to provide security for cryptographic functions. McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems are examples of code-based techniques resistant to quantum attacks. c) Hash-based cryptography: This type of cryptography relies on the properties of cryptographic hash functions and their resistance to preimage attacks. One notable example is the Merkle signature scheme. d) Multivariate cryptography: It involves the usage of multivariate quadratic polynomials over finite fields. The security of this approach is based on the difficulty of solving such systems of non-linear equations. 2. Importance of an interrupt in a microprocessor: Interrupts play a crucial role in the efficient functioning of microprocessors. They are signals that inform the processor of an event or condition demanding immediate attention. Interrupts allow the microprocessor to momentarily pause its current operation and execute an appropriate routine to address the incoming request. Once the routine is completed, the processor resumes its previous operation. The importance of interrupts in microprocessors includes: a) Responsiveness: Interrupts enable a microprocessor to react to time-sensitive events quickly. For instance, servicing a peripheral device that requires attention or responding to real-time input provided by a user. b) Multitasking: Interrupts facilitate the effective execution and management of multiple tasks. By momentarily suspending a task to execute an interrupt service routine, the microprocessor ensures that no single process monopolizes all available resources. c) Resource management: An interrupt-based system can help efficiently manage resources by granting access to shared resources whenever required. For example, an I/O operation can be paused without wasting processor cycles if another task requires immediate attention. d) Power efficiency: Interrupts can be used to put microprocessors into low-power modes, thereby conserving energy when no active tasks require attention. These two questions, although pertaining to different domains within computer science, demonstrate the diverse nature of the field and its potential impact on a wide range of applications and technologies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession? ? The painting known as Queen Elizabeth going in procession to Blackfriars in 1601, or simply The Procession Picture (see illustration), is now often accepted as the work of Peake. The attribution was made by Roy Strong, who called it \\"one of the great visual mysteries of the Elizabethan age\\". It is an example of the convention, prevalent in the later part of her reign, of painting Elizabeth as an icon, portraying her as much younger and more triumphant than she was. As Strong puts it, \\"[t]his is Gloriana in her sunset glory, the mistress of the set piece, of the calculated spectacular presentation of herself to her adoring subjects\\". George Vertue, the eighteenth-century antiquarian, called the painting \\"not well nor ill done\\".Strong reveals that the procession was connected to the marriage of Henry Somerset, Lord Herbert, and Lady Anne Russell, one of the queen's six maids of honour, on 16 June 1600. He identifies many of the individuals portrayed in the procession and shows that instead of a litter, as was previously assumed, Queen Elizabeth is sitting on a wheeled cart or chariot. Strong also suggests that the landscape and castles in the background are not intended to be realistic. In accordance with Elizabethan stylistic conventions, they are emblematic, here representing the Welsh properties of Edward Somerset, Earl of Worcester, to which his son Lord Herbert was the heir. The earl may have commissioned the picture to celebrate his appointment as Master of the Queen's Horse in 1601.Peake clearly did not paint the queen, or indeed the courtiers, from life but from the \\"types\\" or standard portraits used by the workshops of the day. Portraits of the queen were subject to restrictions, and from about 1594 there seems to have been an official policy that she always be depicted as youthful. In 1594, the Privy council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen be found and destroyed, since they caused Elizabeth \\"great offence\\". The famous Ditchley portrait (c. 1592), by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, was...

The ruling People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) has won a huge majority in parliament following the 23 August election, according to official results, meaning he will succeed Jose Eduardo Dos Santos. Under Mr Dos Santos, there was one golden rule for anyone who wanted to survive politically in Angola: Do not make your ambitions known. President Dos Santos remained in charge by making sure that any potential challenger was quickly sidelined. Joao Lourenco, 63, known as JLo, who was born to a family involved in anti-colonial politics, learnt that lesson the hard way. In 1998, the liberation war veteran and Angolan Armed Forces general was elected MPLA secretary-general - a sign that his political fortunes were on the rise. Three years later, when President Dos Santos hinted that he might be ready to resign the presidency, Mr Lourenco made known his interest in the top job. But the MPLA victory, early in 2002, in a 27-year civil war against the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (Unita), served to relaunch Mr Dos Santos' presidency, and any talk of retirement was soon forgotten. The following year at the 2003 MPLA party congress, Mr Lourenco was demoted. In 2012, as Mr Dos Santos approached 70, the succession issue became more pressing. When the president elevated his cousin, Manuel Vicente, to become vice-president, some foreign observers saw this as the anointing of Mr Vicente as a successor. However, Mr Lourenco, would have known better - that the MPLA would never endorse a political outsider like Mr Vicente as president, and that a man with no military pedigree was a risky choice in a country where the security forces lurk in the shadows of politics. Mr Lourenco, on the other hand, could be confident that he himself had both the party and the military credentials, and that this was enough to earn forgiveness for his lack of caution a decade earlier. Sure enough, his appointment as defence minister in 2014 signalled his rehabilitation. And his election in 2016 as MPLA party vice-president left no doubt that he would succeed the by now ailing Mr Dos Santos. But Mr Dos Santos's long-held suspicion of potential rivals has made it nearly impossible for Mr Lourenco, or anyone else, to show initiative or cultivate a following. This makes it difficult to know what to expect from the next president of one of Africa's biggest oil producers. Is Angola's Dos Santos really giving up power? While Mr Lourenco is only 12 years younger than President Dos Santos, he has been forced in the past few months to reinvent himself as a bringer of generational change. The man born in 1954, schooled in the military and in the mysteries of the political culture of the old MPLA, has suddenly discovered social media. He rarely looks entirely comfortable in his Facebook photos, even when relaxing at home with his wife, the former government minister and World Bank official Ana Dias Lourenco. Although not naturally charismatic, Mr Lourenco's down-to-earth image is in sharp contrast to the affected manners of the equally uncharismatic Mr Dos Santos. After the MPLA's final election rally, Mr Lourenco was filmed walking among the crowd, and showing young voters how to make their cross on a sample ballot paper. Although the incident was choreographed for the TV cameras, Mr Lourenco displayed more of a common touch in one minute than his predecessor had managed in decades. He looks set to take control of a state in which President Dos Santos' relatives and loyalists remain in key positions and Mr Dos Santos himself remains in the kingmaker role as MPLA chairman. Mr Lourenco will, however, have the support of those who see the corruption of the Mr Dos Santos regime as a liability to the party's future. The MPLA is under unprecedented pressure. During the post-2003 oil boom, the government did little to diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil. Consequently the slump in the oil price since 2014 has led to a foreign currency squeeze, job losses and soaring food prices in a country where most people were already struggling to make ends meet. Once he takes over as president, Mr Lourenco needs to consolidate an independent support base within the MPLA. And the sooner Mr Dos Santos quits as party leader, the better for Mr Lourenco. In the end, the health of Angola's long-time leader, who has been undergoing cancer treatment for at least a year, could prove crucial.

By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Why is this theory not 100% true?\\" Context: \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The theory that 95% of bird species are socially monogamous is not 100% true for several reasons. First, the occurrence of extra-pair copulations (infidelity) in many socially monogamous species indicates that there is still a significant amount of mating occurring outside of these pair bonds. Additionally, factors such as forced copulation in some species and the presence of sperm storage mechanisms allowing for sperm competition further complicate and challenge the idea of strict monogamy in these bird species. Lastly, the potential benefits for females engaging in extra-pair copulations, like acquiring better genes or insurance against a mate's infertility, suggest that even within socially monogamous species, there may be evolutionary incentives to engage in non-monogamous behavior."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Read this and answer the question While christian festivals such as corpus christi were church-sanctioned celebrations, Carnival was also a manifestation of European folk culture. In the Christian tradition the fasting is to commemorate the 40 days that Jesus fasted in the desert according to the New Testament and also to reflect on Christian values. As with many other Christian festivals such as Christmas which was originally a pagan midwinter festival, the Christian church has found it easier to turn the pagan Carnaval in a catholic tradition than to eliminate it. Unlike today, carnival in the Middle Ages took not just a few days, but it covered almost the entire period between Christmas and the beginning of Lent.

Today, we're going to learn how to make new friends and talk to people we like in a kind, respectful, and fun way. Isn't that exciting? Let's start by exploring some tips on how to be a good friend and a great listener. 1. Don't be shy about how you feel: When you meet someone you want to be friends with, sometimes you might feel shy. That's okay! But remember, it's important to let people know that you like them and want to be friends. Just like in a game of tag, you can't play with someone if you don't tell them you want to play. So don't be shy, go and say \\"Hi!\\" to new people and share your feelings with them. 2. Keep it casual: Being casual means being relaxed and not too serious. Just like playing in a sandbox, you don't need to follow a strict set of rules to have fun and make friends. Talk about the things you like, ask about their favorite toys, or invite them to play with you. Making friends should be fun and easygoing, like playing in the park on a sunny day! 3. Be respectful: Just like how you want others to treat you nicely, it is important to treat them nicely too. Being respectful means listening to what others have to say and not interrupting or saying mean things. Think about how you would feel if someone did that to you. It wouldn't feel very good, right? So, always remember to be respectful to everyone around you. 4. Give her your full attention: Sometimes when we're talking to people, we can get distracted by things like toys, cartoons, or even ice cream! But when you're talking to a friend, it's important to give them your full attention. This means looking at them when they're talking, listening, and not being distracted by other things. This shows your friend that you care about what they're saying, and it will make them happy to know that you're interested in what they have to share. In conclusion, making friends and talking to people can be lots of fun if you remember these tips: Don't be shy, keep it casual, be respectful, and give them your full attention. These little steps will help you make lots of new friends and have a great time with everyone you meet. So go ahead, little friends, put a big smile on your face and start making friends with kindness and respect!"},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task you will be given an arithmetic operation and you have to find its answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: A West Side Story With a Promising Ending By contrast, Annapolis’s historic east side continued to hum with activity. That part of the 6.5-square-mile metropolis — the city’s population is 35,900, according to 2000 census figures — consists of mostly upscale single-family homes, an area of small shops and pubs catering to the tourist trade, and historic sites like the United States Naval Academy. Since 1985, Annapolis has spent around 13 million on the west side to revamp outdated zoning laws, build a new traffic circle, bury utility lines and install tree-lined brick sidewalks. It has also created a special tax district for the ongoing construction of a 25 million, three-story underground parking garage for 1,200 cars. Restaurants and shops have since opened in restored turn-of-the-20th-century homes near Park Place, and now home buyers, particularly those looking for luxury apartments, have rediscovered the area. “Our west side is finally becoming the uptown here that we’ve all been waiting for,” said Kurt A. Hornig, 37, a real estate salesman who works in Baltimore. “The west side is becoming very chic, like South Beach in Miami or D.C.” Mr. Hornig is selling his three-bedroom house on the city’s east side, where many homes go for 1 million and more, and moving into a one-bedroom condo in Park Place. He is being joined there by Bill and Shirley Vining, who were eager to downsize but unwilling to move to a larger metropolis like Washington to the west or Baltimore to the northwest, each about 25 miles away. They bought a two-bedroom condo. Park Place prices range from 525,000 for a one-bedroom to 1.99 million for a duplex penthouse with two terraces. The changes on the west side had been a long time in coming. Despite broad community support, the city’s revitalization plans were delayed by economic downturns, explained Tom Smith, the city’s planning commissioner. “Not a whole lot was happening in the way of development during the recession in 1990-92,” Mr. Smith said. Then, after the city’s zoning laws were rewritten in the late 1990s to encourage more development, he said, the 9/11 terrorist attacks took another toll on the local economy. The 11-acre Park Place is being developed jointly by the Carlyle Group, an investment company based in Washington, and the Jerome J. Parks Companies, a local family business that has constructed some 30 projects in the Baltimore-Washington area over the last 50 years. About 70 percent of the condominiums have already been sold, according to Jerome J. Parks, who is the company’s chief executive. The condos will enable buyers like the Vinings to downsize from their five-bedroom colonial on the east side yet still remain in the city. “We’re at that stage of life when we don’t want a big house anymore, but we also don’t want to leave friends and family who live around here,” said Mr. Vining, 71, a semiretired management consultant. “Up until now, though, there were no alternatives in Annapolis.” Mike and Joyce Gering, who live part-time in Tucson, where Mr. Gering runs a solar energy company, also bought a two-bedroom condo at Park Place. With strong family ties in Annapolis and the surrounding area — they raised their family of nine children in nearby Dunkirk — they had wanted a home base in Maryland. “We set out to find a penthouse-level condo in D.C. or Baltimore,” Mr. Gering said. “But Washington is too big a city for our tastes and Baltimore is a little out of the way, so when we heard about what was going on in Annapolis, we jumped.” The couple say they like the west side’s easy access along major highways to Washington and Baltimore and its proximity to the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Douglas Carter, the architect in charge of Park Place’s design, said he was instructed by the developers to “tap into history.” After a recent visit to Paris, Mr. Parks returned with photos of Old World architectural details that he wanted incorporated into the new construction. Mr. Carter explained that his firm, Davis Carter Scott Architects, which has offices in McLean and Middleburg in Virginia, planned “a development that would fit into the community rather than look like it was inserted into it.” Annapolis is renowned for buildings at the United States Naval Academy, which has three Beaux Arts-style structures designed in 1899 by Ernest Flagg. Park Place’s buildings include European-style Beaux Arts architectural details, small plazas and landscaped courtyards, according to Mr. Carter. The grand plaza and one of the roads can be closed off for street festivals and special events. Four commercial tenants, including Merrill Lynch and the Building Owners and Managers Institute International, have so far leased 125,000 square feet. The retailers include the Papery, Varuna Aveda Salon & Dayspa, Starbucks Coffee and the Carpaccio Italian Bistro. Morton’s, the Steakhouse, a dining chain with seven other restaurants in the Washington-Baltimore area, also plans to open a 130-seat restaurant at Park Place, according to Roger J. Drake, a spokesman for Morton’s. While pleased with the progress made so far on the west side, Ms. Moyer, the mayor of Annapolis, conceded that “there is still a lot of work to do.” Aging strip shopping centers still line the corridor. “It’s not a very impressive introduction to the city,” Ms. Moyer said. “In time we plan to make more improvements to turn it into a true gateway and bring back some of the grandeur that it had when Washington used to come to Annapolis.” The National Perspectives article last Sunday, about a new mixed-used development on the west side of Annapolis, Md., misidentified the river that touches this part of the city. It is the Severn River, not the Potomac. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page RE9 of the New York edition with the headline: A West Side Story With a Promising Ending.

The food and service the restaurant was great, and the customer service in the gift shop was excellent as well.

The dealers Nana and Leissle were happy to have a change of pace and to play with 4 girls excited and eager not only to tip but to celebrate our winnings together. The cocktail waitresses also enjoyed our company. We sat at this table For at least 3 hours while the pit boss Ralph continued to tell us we were too loud?!?!!?! As the 4th hour approached us, my friend and I hit a 3rd blackjack in a row betting a 25 hand and we all screamed in excitement. The PitBoss Ralph- then decided to kick myself and my friend out for being too loud! When I asked for a manager, they brought over a large security guard named Mark to escort us out. As we tried to reason with them, I kindly and cooperatively asked to speak with a manager. They denied me the rights to speak with a manager then Mark put his hands on me and told me he would call the cops. I then asked to speak to his manager. After two more security guards came over and our friends were in tears and we had all been denied the right to speak to a manager they denied us yet again and asked us to fill out a comment card! Even one of the cocktail waitresses walked over to explain to the security guard that we were doing nothing wrong. The security guards then warned us they had called the police and they were on their way. We exited the casino immediately after that. I will never stay here again, nor will my team or anyone I know.

Solve this instance: Background: Febrile respiratory illness (FRI) has a high impact on public health and global economics and poses a difficult challenge for differential diagnosis. A particular issue is the detection of genetically diverse pathogens, i.e. human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses (HEV) which are frequent causes of FRI. Resequencing Pathogen Microarray technology has demonstrated potential for differential diagnosis of several respiratory pathogens simultaneously, but a high confidence design method to select probes for genetically diverse viruses is lacking. Results: Using HRV and HEV as test cases, we assess a general design strategy for detecting and serotyping genetically diverse viruses. A minimal number of probe sequences (26 for HRV and 13 for HEV), which were potentially capable of detecting all serotypes of HRV and HEV, were determined and implemented on the Resequencing Pathogen Microarray RPM-Flu v.30/31 (Tessarae RPM-Flu). The specificities of designed probes were validated using 34 HRV and 28 HEV strains. All strains were successfully detected and identified at least to species level. 33 HRV strains and 16 HEV strains could be further differentiated to serotype level. This study provides a fundamental evaluation of simultaneous detection and differential identification of genetically diverse RNA viruses with a minimal number of prototype sequences. The results demonstrated that the newly designed RPM-Flu v.30/31 can provide comprehensive and specific analysis of HRV and HEV samples which implicates that this design strategy will be applicable for other genetically diverse viruses.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. When did the narrator start her self-portrait?

Social stability fosters a favorable environment for business operations and investments, which in turn helps boost competitiveness. 5. Innovation: A strong focus on research and development (R&D) and fostering an environment that encourages innovation is vital to competitiveness. Countries and businesses must invest in R&D and encourage collaboration between academia, industry, and the public sector, to produce new ideas and technologies that give them a competitive edge in the global market. 6. Financial System: A robust, inclusive, and well-regulated financial system that is efficient in allocating resources is crucial for economic growth and competitiveness. This includes ensuring companies have access to the necessary capital to finance their operations and invest in growth opportunities, as well as promoting financial inclusion for all citizens. 7. International Trade: Ensuring access to global markets and promoting trade diversification is essential for increasing competitiveness. Greater access to markets around the world allows businesses to grow, which in turn provides opportunities for job creation and economic growth. In conclusion, focusing on these basic conditions and working towards creating a competitive environment is critical for businesses and economies to thrive in today's global market. By investing in infrastructure, education, social stability, innovation, and other key factors, countries can improve their competitiveness and build a strong foundation for future growth and prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are given a new situation: Two cities, Appleton and Orangeburg, are approximately 100 miles apart and are currently experiencing different weather.

He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving it in the spill vase.\\" Does it follow that \\"He was then forced to leave the house.\\"?","completion":"Yes, \\"He was therefore forced to depart from the house, leaving it in the spill vase\\" does logically imply \\"He was then forced to leave the house\\". The reasoning behind this conclusion involves breaking down the original statement and its implications: 1) \\"He was therefore forced to depart from the house\\" -> This directly implies that he was forced to leave the house, which essentially is the statement we are required to verify. Therefore, logically, the statement \\"He was then forced to leave the house\\" does follow. 2) \\"leaving it in the spill vase\\" -> This part of the sentence, although providing more context about what happened when he departed, is not in contradiction or does not change the fact that indeed he had to leave the house. This statement implies that he had to leave something (likely a key or similar object) in a spill vase. However, it doesn't alter the fact that he was forced to leave the house. However, it's important to note the time indication \\"then\\" in the statement \\"He was then forced to leave the house\\" isn't necessarily implicit in the original sentence. It does imply an order of events, but without additional context it's ambiguous if \\"then\\" relates directly to the event of being forced to leave. Nonetheless, the essential idea that he had to leave the house still stands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Dialogue: Jen: Did you do ake the chicken out to defrost? Tim: shit forgot Tim: i'm on it Jen: to late, I'll just get something else at the store Tim: sorry Jen: no prob see ya What was going on in that conversation?","completion":"In that conversation, Jen and Tim were discussing their plan for dinner. It appears that they intended to cook chicken for dinner that night, but in order to do so, they needed to take it out of the freezer to defrost earlier in the day. At the beginning of the conversation, Jen asked Tim if he had remembered to take the chicken out to defrost. Tim immediately realized and admitted that he had forgotten to do so. He offered to promptly rectify the situation by taking care of the task, most likely knowing that this would delay their dinner plans. Jen, recognizing that it was too late for the chicken to be properly defrosted in time for their dinner plans, decided to change her approach. Rather than waiting for the chicken to defrost, she informed Tim that she would go to the store to purchase something else for dinner. This would allow them to still have dinner without waiting for the chicken to be ready. Tim apologized for his forgetfulness, showing remorse for any inconvenience he may have caused. Jen, however, did not seem too bothered by the change of plans and assured Tim that it was not a problem. She then ended the conversation with a casual \\"see ya,\\" indicating that they would most likely catch up later, possibly when they would have dinner together. Overall, the conversation demonstrated clear communication between Jen and Tim and their ability to adapt their plans when facing unexpected setbacks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The cohesion policy is the best proof of solidarity that exists in the European Union. The cohesion policy, established within the European Union (EU), serves as evidence of the strong sense of solidarity among its member states. The EU's cohesion policy aims to reduce economic, social, and territorial disparities between different regions by promoting integrated and sustainable development. This policy ensures that all regions within the EU can benefit from the single market and reach their full potential. Several key principles underline the cohesion policy, including concentration, partnership, multilevel governance, and additionality. Concentration focuses on prioritizing investment in the regions and sectors where the impact would be the most significant, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently. Partnership involves the active participation of regional and local authorities, NGOs, and social partners in planning, implementing, and evaluating cohesion policy initiatives. Multilevel governance highlights the shared responsibility between various levels of government within the EU to achieve common objectives. Additionally, the concept of additionality ensures that EU funding provided to the regions is supplementary to the investments carried out by national governments, instead of merely replacing them. The cohesion policy is funded primarily through three main sources: the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), and the Cohesion Fund. The ERDF aims to support economic development and innovation, investment in infrastructure, and the creation of sustainable and quality jobs. The ESF, on the other hand, focuses on promoting social inclusion, combating poverty, and investing in human capital through education and training initiatives. Lastly, the Cohesion Fund is dedicated primarily to the less-developed European regions, providing support for environmental and transportation infrastructure projects. Moreover, the cohesion policy encourages the creation of European Territorial Cooperation (ETC) programs. These programs, also known as Interreg, facilitate cooperation between regions across borders, which strengthens overall solidarity within the EU. Through these programs, numerous regions can work together to tackle common challenges in areas such as sustainable development, innovation, and social inclusion. In conclusion, the European Union's cohesion policy exemplifies the solidarity shared among its member states. By aiming to reduce disparities and promote sustainable development across all regions, cohesion policy endeavors to unite the diverse territories of the EU to achieve shared goals and prosperity. The successful implementation of this policy and its principles demonstrates the importance of collaboration and mutual support in fostering a stronger, more integrated European Union."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. Mark and his brother Jeffrey have to leave their cars outside because their parents' cars take up the entire garage. Mark's car has a very dark interior, while Jeffrey's car has a lighter colored interior. It is mid-afternoon on a sunny day in July, and Mark and Jeffrey are deciding which car they want to take to go to the movies. Which car, Mark's or Jeffrey's, will be hotter on the inside? A:","completion":"Mark's car will be hotter on the inside due to its dark interior. Let's explore the science behind this phenomenon. As you mentioned, absorption occurs when light transfers its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by it. The color of an object is determined by the wavelengths of light it reflects, while the other wavelengths are absorbed. Dark colors, such as black, absorb a wider range of wavelengths, meaning they absorb more of the incident sunlight and convert that energy into heat. In contrast, lighter colors reflect more of the sunlight, so they absorb less energy and don't heat up as much. In the case of Mark's and Jeffrey's cars, Mark's vehicle has a dark interior, which absorbs a greater amount of sunlight compared to Jeffrey's car with a lighter-colored interior. The result of this absorption is an increase in the internal temperature of Mark's car. Since both cars are sitting outside in the sun, the same amount of sunlight is striking both vehicles. However, due to the dark interior of Mark's car, it will be absorbing more of the sun's energy than Jeffrey's vehicle. As a consequence, Mark's car will have a higher internal temperature than Jeffrey's car in the middle of a sunny day in July, making it the hotter option. The brothers might want to consider taking Jeffrey's car with a lighter-colored interior to the movies to have a more comfortable and cooler ride."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:In a cheap motel near Peckham California, a maid discovers a man's corpse in one of the rooms. The dead man, Professor Grabowski, is associated with the Brandt Research center, and an autopsy reveals he died of a massive coronary during sexual intercourse. Another similar death is discovered almost immediately, this time a younger man. This causes the federal government to send in Agent Neil Agar (William Smith) to get to the bottom of things. He gets the background on the deaths by consulting with local police captain Peters.In the small town the Brandt Facility is doing research with genetics and atomic power. Grabowski's assistant, Julie Zorn (Victoria Vetri), becomes Agar's contact in the investigation. More men turn up dead of sexual exhaustion, including a 21 year old man, and the locals become highly agitated. It seems there are a lot of aggressive male types in Peckham, and Julie tells Neil that the scientists at Brandt are no different than the others, preoccupied with sex and enjoying a promiscuous lifestyle that includes partner-swapping. Other Brandt luminaries are not so fortunate, such as geneticist Stan Williams, whose wife treats him in a cold and shrewish manner.When Brandt's Dr. Murger suggests that he has a theory about the strange deaths, he is subsequently run down by a car, driven by an unseen person. When Agar investigates, he discovers that Murger had a male lover and was not interested in women sexually at all. The socially distant Dr. Susan Harris (Anitra Ford), who is in charge of some mysterious research in bee culture, becomes a key suspect for Agar. Harris makes a move on Brandt scientist Herb Kline, inviting him over to her house, seducing him, and having sex with him. During intercourse, her eyes suddenly turn completely black, and Kline suffers a fatal heart attack just like the other men. After Kline's death, his wife receives a phone call from an unidentified female, luring her to Dr. Harris's lab, where Harris and a number of other women overpower her and force her through a strange process where she is stripped nude, covered in a mysterious substance, and placed in a chamber adjacent to a colony of bees, which cover her. Harris has a large machine setup that bombards her female victims with radiation, transforming them into women who have the ability to kill men by having sex with them.The next day, Captain Peters goes to visit Mrs. Kline to inform her of her husband's death, but instead of reacting with grief, she becomes sexually aggressive and attempts to seduce him. Fortunately, he leaves. Stan Williams isn't so lucky; his recently transformed wife seduces him and manages to kill him. In an ironic twist, he strangles her as he dies and they both wind up dead. Agar manages to piece the puzzle together himself, but before he can apprehend Dr. Harris, she lures Julie into her lab and begins the transformation process on her. Agar arrives in time to stop the procedure, firing a bullet into Harris's machine and breaking it. The lab begins to explode, and the bee girls slowly die, including Dr. Harris. The film ends as Agar and Julie begin a romantic interlude., Question: Where is the cheap motel located? Solution:","completion":"The cheap motel is located near Peckham, California."},{"prompt":"Q: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” According to the above context, answer the following question.

[i] Yes [ii] No A:","completion":"[i] Yes, the correct answer is \\"sharks.\\" Your question, \\"what breathing use gills to convert oxygen in blood?\\" is a rephrased form of the statement you provided, which is \\"Sharks breathing use gills to convert oxygen in blood.\\" In this context, it is clear that sharks are the organism that possess the described feature of using gills for respiration and oxygen conversion in blood. Gills are specialized respiratory organs that enable aquatic animals, particularly fish, to extract oxygen from water and simultaneously release carbon dioxide. They serve as the primary mechanism for these animals to obtain the oxygen they need for their metabolic processes. Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton (as opposed to bony fish), a streamlined body shape, and several sets of gills slit openings to carry out respiration. As water passes over the gills, diffusion occurs, where oxygen from the water moves into the shark's bloodstream, while carbon dioxide from its blood is released into the water. This gas exchange is essential for sharks to maintain their cellular functions, produce energy, and thrive in their underwater habitats.

Question: What is the reason for the description of liking to travel and seeming superficial ?","completion":"Well, when someone likes to travel and explore, it means they enjoy seeing new places and meeting new people. They are curious and want to experience many different things in life. Now, when someone is called superficial, it means that they may not care too much about deep or serious things like planning for the future or working hard to achieve a goal. So, the reason for this description is that the person likes to have fun and enjoy the present instead of worrying about what comes next. They might not seem focused on the important stuff in life, but they are really good at having adventures and enjoying themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how can an animal learn actions?\\" is \\"chemical energy\\", given that actions can be learned through play? Answer:","completion":"While \\"chemical energy\\" can play a role in an animal's learning process, it is not the most comprehensive answer to the question of how animals learn actions. There are several interconnected factors, including play, that contribute to an animal's ability to learn actions. These factors include the animal's genetic predispositions, environment, cognitive abilities, social interactions, emotional states, and motivation. Chemical energy, specifically in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is necessary for all living organisms, including animals, as it provides energy for various physiological processes. Although it is an essential component for animals to function and carry out actions, it is not the sole aspect in the learning process, particularly when it comes to actions learned through play. The act of play in animals has multiple purposes, which include physical development, cognitive development, emotional well-being, and social communication. Through play, animals have the opportunity to practice and refine their motor skills and coordination as well as problem-solving and decision-making skills. This learning process involves a complex interplay between an animal's brain, senses, and body that goes beyond mere chemical energy. One crucial aspect of animal learning is the use of reinforcement and punishment, often known as operant conditioning. An animal learns to associate a specific action with a positive outcome or negative consequence, which eventually shapes their behavior. The neurotransmitter dopamine plays a vital role in this process, as it is responsible for conveying reward signals in the brain. However, it is also important to consider other neurotransmitter systems and their interactions with hormones that influence learning, motivation, and emotions in animals. Furthermore, animals also learn from their surroundings and experiences. They can develop strategies based on trial and error, observation or through social learning. Social learning occurs when an animal observes and later imitates the actions of another animal. In some cases, animals may learn new behaviors from their parents or other members of their social group, which can be essential for their survival and integration into the group. Additionally, the animal's cognitive abilities should be taken into account. Learning can vary depending on species, individual differences in intelligence, and the complexity of the action or behavior being learned. Animals with advanced cognitive abilities, such as primates and dolphins, are capable of learning complex actions and behaviors and can even demonstrate innovation and creativity during play. In conclusion, the right answer to the question, \\"how can an animal learn actions?\\" is a combination of factors that include genetic predispositions, environment, cognitive abilities, social interactions, emotional states, motivation, and reinforcement. While chemical energy is indispensable for an animal's overall functioning, learning actions through play or other means is a much more intricate process involving numerous interrelated components that work together to enable the animal to learn and adapt throughout their life."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Passage: The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (Amendment XIV) is one of the post-Civil War amendments, intended to secure rights for former slaves. It includes the due process and equal protection clauses among others. The amendment introduces the concept of incorporation of all relevant federal rights against the states. While it has not been fully implemented, the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure, through the Due Process Clause and Privileges and Immunities Clause, the application of most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: What is the minimum age requirement for a person to be protected under the Fourteenth Amendment? The passage doesn't mention any age constraints. Thus, this question is unanswerable based on the given information. Part #2: Create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: Which Supreme Court case first utilized the doctrine of incorporation? This question asks for specific information about a Supreme Court case, which is not provided in the passage. Part #3: Replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question. Usage: How has the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution impacted the protection of former slaves? The passage is about the Fourteenth Amendment, not the Twentieth. Thus, the question is unanswerable based on the given information. Part #4: Create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: Has the doctrine of incorporation failed to apply most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights to the states? The passage states that the doctrine of incorporation has been used to ensure the application of most of the rights, so by inserting the negation word \\"failed,\\" the question becomes unanswerable based on the provided information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Explanation: 1). Charging a bull with a javelin is not the most logical next event, as it involves an action typically associated with bullfighting, which has a different context from simply sitting on a horse. 2). Jumping off the horse and tying the legs of a calf is associated with calf roping in a rodeo event, but it is again not the most logical next event as it requires the man to first dismount the horse. 4). Moving around the horse and lassoing it is not logical, as the man is already sitting on the horse, indicating it is likely tamed and does not need to be lassoed. Option 3, pulling a horse rope as he stands on the horse, is the most logical next event because it involves an action that can be performed while still seated on the horse and suggests that the man is attempting to control or guide the horse's motions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Learning your dog's habits, mannerisms, and movements through observation will allow the process of understanding its communication behavior to feel more natural. There will be plenty of things it does that will make sense to you without explanation. Just as every person is unique, so is your dog. Be aware that much of a dog's language or communication techniques are subtle. By learning canine communication, you will be able to respond to any problems your dog expresses before a situation escalates. Not noticing small signs of stress or unhappiness can soon lean to more aggressive or distressed behaviors. Remember that this is a two-way learning process. Dogs have to learn our behavioral cues as well, and you should be careful about your own gestures and posture. Dogs also do not understand English. It is important that you teach your dog what you mean by \\"no\\" or \\"sit\\". Just saying \\"sit\\" over and over again won't make him learn it, and will make him think it's just part of the random nonsense you say during the day. Luring your dog into a sit position and then rewarding them heavily for doing that task will make him eager to sit, and then saying the word as he sits will make him connect the dots that the word \\"sit\\" means \\"put your butt on the floor\\". Note that a dog's ability to signal may be hampered by the breed in question. For example, if your dog has squat ears or a docked tail, some of the signals may not apply to him/her. Consider how you feel when someone stares at you directly rather than using normal eye contact. Just as you find it confronting, dogs also feel confused and threatened by direct head-on staring because it is a threat stance for them. A dog that looks away in this situation is actually being polite and is seeking to avoid confrontation. Alternately, training your dog to make eye contact to communicate is extremely helpful for keeping his focus on you. The most effective forms of dog training are positive reinforcement and clicker training. These are the most consistently proven type of training shown by scientists, veterinarians and animal behaviorists. Punishment is frowned upon because it is proven that dogs have very short memories, and likely do not connect situations like them pooping on the floor to your dissatisfaction. In fact, dogs do not feel guilt. Their owners simply stop being as mad when they \\"look guilty\\" and it becomes rewarding for both the owner and dog for the dog to offer signs of \\"guilt\\". The dog learns you dislike it when poop is on the floor and when you come home, they \\"act guilty\\" in order to appease you. They do not in fact relate their action of pooping to you being mad. Clicker training is the idea is to lure your dog into a position and indicate instantly they have done the right thing, and reward them for that behavior. Dog behavior is driven by the most rewarding or least punishing option they have in every situation. If the most rewarding option is to chew on your shoes, they will do so. If you reward them for not chewing on your shoes, they will choose to do that even when you are not around. In contrast, punishment or dominance suggests showing the dog who is boss, which simply results in the behavior being done when you are not around. Dogs are highly reward based and the dominance theory has been disproven. Dogs act in ways that are most rewarding, not based on trying to \\"dominate\\" you or another dog. Be the most rewarding thing in your dogs life and he will be eager to do whatever you say. Rolling over and exposing the belly is a gesture to appease you, and giving a belly rub serves as excellent reinforcement for this behavior. An exposed belly can also indicate passive resistance to a perceived threat. Mounting (or humping) can be a sign of stress in a dog, especially where a low-confidence dog is trying to establish allegiance with a higher-confidence animal. Dogs use a variety of gestures and postures to express discomfort, including excessive/misplaced sneezing or yawning, licking of the lips, avoiding eye contact, cowering, whale eye (seeing the whites or their eye) and a stiff body. When a dog is showing discomfort, the best thing to do is to stop what you are doing and not do it in the future. If you need your dog to be comfortable with something, make it very rewarding by giving them tons of treats and introducing them to the uncomfortable thing slowly. Soon your pooch will be offering to do those things for a treat! A dog can show many emotions with his tail. A wagging tail and wiggly butt mean pure joy. A slowly wagging tail means a cautious nature. A stiff tail held high is a sign of alertness, a low tail is a sign of content. A tucked tail means they are scared.","completion":"To understand your dog, watch how they move, act, and use body language. Every dog is unique and some things they do will make sense to you without explaining. Dogs don't know English, so you need to teach them what words like \\"no\\" or \\"sit\\" mean using rewards and good timing. Some dogs might have trouble sending signals because of their breed or body shape. Dogs can feel threatened if stared at, so be careful with your eye contact. There are good ways to train your dog that use rewards and positive actions, like clicker training. Punishing your dog is not good because they have short memories and don't understand why they're being punished. Instead, make good actions rewarding for your dog. Dogs use their bodies to show how they feel, like exposing their belly when they want to be playful or showing discomfort by sneezing, yawning, or cowering. The best way to help a dog that's uncomfortable is to give them treats and slowly introduce them to things that scare them. Dogs can use their tails to show emotions, like wagging when they're happy, or tucking their tail when they're scared."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which of these facts about Rhea best indicates that it does not have a water cycle in which water changes state? -","completion":"Rhea is the second-largest moon of Saturn and the ninth-largest moon in the solar system. While several factors hint that it does not have a water cycle in which water changes state, I will elaborate on them individually. 1. Surface Composition: Rhea's surface is dominated by water ice, with smaller amounts of silicate rock and other frozen materials. Although there are some darker regions, which indicate the presence of contaminants or impurities, the overall composition of the surface does not facilitate the presence of liquid water that would be necessary for a water cycle in which water changes state. 2. Temperature: The average surface temperature on Rhea ranges between -220°C and -171°C. These extremely low temperatures mean that any water present on Rhea would be frozen and unable to undergo phase changes as it would on Earth, for instance. 3. Atmosphere: Rhea has a very thin and unstable oxygen and carbon dioxide exosphere, resulting from radiolysis – the dissociation of molecules when exposed to radiation. This thin atmosphere makes it difficult for a water cycle to exist, as there would not be enough pressure to maintain liquid water or water vapor. In comparison, Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, with water vapor being an essential component for our water cycle. 4. Gravity: With a mass much lower than Earth's, Rhea's gravity is insufficient to hold a substantial atmosphere, which would be necessary for condensation and the water cycle. Lower gravity also means there's not enough force to drive water flows, like rivers and oceans, which contribute to the water cycle on Earth. 5. Geologic Activity: There is little evidence of geologic activity or heating from Rhea's interior. Without active geothermal processes or volcanic activity, there is no mechanism to generate and release significant amounts of liquid water or water vapor. 6. Solar Distance: Rhea is located far away from the Sun, with an average distance of about 1.4 billion kilometers. Due to this vast distance, the amount of sunlight that reaches Rhea is minimal, resulting in limited energy for any potential water cycle. Earth, being much closer to the Sun, receives adequate solar energy that contributes to evaporation and the rest of the water cycle. In summary, considering factors such as Rhea's surface composition, predominantly low surface temperatures, thin atmosphere, weak gravity, lack of geologic activity, and distance from the Sun, it is evident that a water cycle in which water changes state (such as the one found on Earth) does not exist on Rhea."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze the given information: \\"A man is placing paste on the wall\\" informs us that a man is applying some substance (paste) to the wall. We need to find out if this action could be described as \\"A man putting spackle on the wall.\\" 2. Identify the terms: The terms in question here are \\"paste\\" and \\"spackle.\\" We need to understand the relationship between these terms. 3. Define the terms: \\"Paste\\" is a general term that can refer to any substance that has a thick, sticky, or smooth consistency. \\"Spackle\\" is a specific type of paste used for filling holes or cracks in walls and smoothing surfaces. 4. Compare the terms: Comparing the definitions, we can see that \\"spackle\\" is a type of \\"paste.\\" However, not all pastes are spackle. 5. Consider the context: Since the man is applying the paste to the wall, it is more likely that he is using spackle rather than a different type of paste. In most cases, spackle is used for wall-related tasks such as filling holes or cracks and smoothing surfaces. 6. Draw a conclusion: Based on the context and comparison of the terms, we can conclude that it is possible to interpret the statement \\"A man is placing paste on the wall\\" as \\"A man putting spackle on the wall.\\" However, it would be safer to verify if the exact type of paste is spackle before drawing a definitive conclusion."},{"prompt":"Kai dressed alike because she had no style.

Q:Information: - A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei. - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. - Angina pectoris, commonly known as angina, is the sensation of chest pain, pressure, or squeezing, often due to not enough blood flow to the heart muscle as a result of obstruction or spasm of the coronary arteries. While angina pectoris can occur due to anemia, abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure, its main cause is coronary artery disease, an atherosclerotic process affecting the arteries feeding the heart. The term derives from the Latin \\"angere\\" (\\"to strangle\\") and \\"pectus\\" (\\"chest\\"), and can therefore be translated as \\"a strangling feeling in the chest\\". - Tritium (or ; symbol ' or ', also known as hydrogen-3) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth, where trace amounts are formed by the interaction of the atmosphere with cosmic rays. It is produced by irradiating lithium metal in a nuclear reactor. Tritium is used as a radioactive tracer, in radioluminescent light sources for watches and instruments, and in nuclear weapons. The name of this isotope is formed from the Greek word (\\"trítos\\") meaning \\"third\\". - A radioactive tracer, or radioactive label, is a chemical compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radioisotope so by virtue of its radioactive decay it can be used to explore the mechanism of chemical reactions by tracing the path that the radioisotope follows from reactants to products. Radiolabeling is thus the radioactive form of isotopic labeling. - Lithium (from , \\"stone\\") is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, appears only in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. - AstraZeneca plc is a BritishSwedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company. In 2013 it moved its headquarters to Cambridge, England, and concentrated its R&D in three sites: Cambridge, Gaithersburg, Maryland (location of MedImmune) for work on biopharmaceuticals, and Mölndal (near Gothenburg) in Sweden, for research on traditional chemical drugs. In 2015 it was the eighth largest drug company in the world based on sales revenue. - Alprenolol, or alfeprol, alpheprol, and alprenololum (Gubernal, Regletin, Yobir, Apllobal, Aptine, Aptol Duriles), is a non-selective beta blocker as well as 5-HT receptor antagonist, used in the treatment of angina pectoris. It is no longer marketed by AstraZeneca, but may still be available from other pharmaceutical companies or generically. - A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research. Today there are about 450 nuclear power reactors that are used to generate electricity in about 30 countries around the world. - Dihydroalprenolol ( DHA ) is a hydrogenated alprenolol derivative that acts as a beta - adrenergic blocker . When the extra hydrogen atoms are tritium , it is a radiolabeled form of alprenolol , which is used to label beta - adrenergic receptors for isolation . - Cosmic rays are high-energy radiation, mainly originating outside the Solar System. Upon impact with the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays can produce showers of secondary particles that sometimes reach the surface. Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of mysterious origin. Data from the \\"Fermi\\" space telescope (2013) have been interpreted as evidence that a significant fraction of primary cosmic rays originate from the supernovae explosions of stars. Active galactic nuclei probably also produce cosmic rays. - Beta blocker, also written -blocker, is a class of medications that are particularly used to manage cardiac arrhythmias, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first heart attack (secondary prevention). They are also widely used to treat hypertension, although they are no longer the first choice for initial treatment of most patients. - Hydrogen is a chemical element with chemical symbol H and atomic number 1. With an atomic weight of , hydrogen is the lightest element on the periodic table. Its monatomic form (H) is the most abundant chemical substance in the Universe, constituting roughly 75% of all baryonic mass. Non-remnant stars are mainly composed of hydrogen in the plasma state. The most common isotope of hydrogen, termed \\"protium\\" (name rarely used, symbol H), has one proton and no neutrons. - A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or a combination of fission and fusion (thermonuclear weapon). Both reactions release vast quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter. The first test of a fission (\\"atomic\\") bomb released the same amount of energy as approximately . The first thermonuclear (\\"hydrogen\\") bomb test released the same amount of energy as approximately . What is the relationship between 'dihydroalprenolol' and 'chemical compound'? A:","completion":"Dihydroalprenolol (DHA) is a specific example of a chemical compound. A chemical compound is a substance composed of two or more different elements chemically bonded together in a fixed proportion. Dihydroalprenolol is formed by the combination of various elements in a specific arrangement, and it serves as a beta-adrenergic blocker. In a radiolabeled form, where extra hydrogen atoms are tritium, it is used to label beta-adrenergic receptors for isolation. So, the relationship between dihydroalprenolol and chemical compound is that dihydroalprenolol is a type of chemical compound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: Hypercholesterolemia is associated with abnormal endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation due to decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. Our aim was to examine the effect of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to the hypercholesterolemic rabbit carotid artery in vivo. In addition, we examined whether adenovirus-mediated gene transfer was associated with vascular dysfunction.', 'Rabbits were fed a 1% cholesterol diet for 4 weeks followed by a 0.5% cholesterol diet for 6 weeks. Vascular reactivity was assessed in nontransduced carotid arteries from chow- and cholesterol-fed animals. In addition, carotid arteries were surgically isolated, and 2 separate doses of adenoviral vectors encoding eNOS or beta-galactosidase (AdbetaGal) on the contralateral side were delivered to the lumen (1x10(10) and 5x10(10) pfu/mL).', 'Abnormal acetylcholine-mediated endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was detected in the carotid artery from cholesterol-fed animals, whereas responses to calcium ionophore A23187 and diethylamine NONOate were normal. Vascular reactivity was similar in nontransduced and AdbetaGal-transduced hypercholesterolemic vessels. In vessels transduced with eNOS, transgene expression was demonstrated by immunostaining in both the endothelium and the adventitia and by Western blot analysis. High-dose but not low-dose eNOS gene transfer enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation in vessels from cholesterol-fed rabbits.

În acest sens, acordăm o mare importanţă finalizării cu succes a Agendei de dezvoltare de la Doha (DDA). Translate to English","completion":"In this regard, we attach great importance to the successful completion of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) is a comprehensive plan for international trade and development that was initiated in November 2001 at the 4th Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Doha, Qatar. The primary goal of the DDA is to integrate developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs) into the global trading system, while addressing various trade-related issues, including market access and trade rules. The DDA consists of several elements, including: 1. Market Access: The objective is to improve market access for goods and services traded between countries by reducing barriers such as tariffs, quotas, and subsidies. Market access negotiations under the DDA have focused on key sectors such as agriculture, non-agricultural market access (NAMA), and services. 2. Agriculture: Agriculture is a crucial sector in international trade negotiations due to its significance in global food security and economic development. The DDA aims to introduce significant reforms in agriculture by lowering trade barriers, reducing domestic support measures that distort trade, and eliminating export subsidies. 3. Development: Development is at the core of the DDA, as a significant part of the agenda is dedicated to addressing the challenges faced by developing countries and LDCs in integrating into the global trading system. The DDA provides a 'Special and Differential Treatment' (SDT) to these countries, offering them more time and flexibility to adjust to new rules and commitments. 4. Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS): The DDA includes discussions on improving the TRIPS agreement to provide better protection for intellectual property rights while addressing public health concerns, especially in developing countries. 5. Trade Facilitation: This involves simplifying customs procedures to reduce the cost and time taken in the movement of goods across borders. The Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) was agreed upon in 2013 during the 9th Ministerial Conference in Bali, Indonesia, and highlights one of the successful outcomes of the DDA. 6. Rules: The DDA seeks to improve and clarify various trade rules, such as anti-dumping, subsidies, countervailing measures, and regional trade agreements, to ensure a more transparent and fair global trading system. Despite the importance of the Doha Development Agenda and numerous efforts by WTO members, the negotiations have faced several challenges and have not yet been concluded. Reasons for the lack of conclusion include disagreements between developed and developing countries on crucial issues such as agricultural subsidies and industrial tariffs and the changing global economic landscape, which has given rise to new players dominating international trade. Nonetheless, finalizing the Doha Development Agenda remains a priority for many countries and organizations, as it has the potential to foster economic growth, development, and global trade cooperation. The successful completion of the DDA would help achieve a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable trade system that benefits nations around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: The MAUD Committee reports urged the co-operation with the United States should be continued in the research of nuclear fission. Charles C. Lauritsen, a Caltech physicist working at the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), was in London during this time and was invited to sit in on a MAUD meeting. The committee pushed for rapid development of nuclear weapons using gaseous-diffusion as their isotope separation device. Once he returned to the United States, he was able to brief Vannevar Bush, the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), concerning the details discussed during the meeting.In August 1941, Mark Oliphant, the director of the physics department at the University of Birmingham and an original member of the MAUD Committee, was sent to the US to assist the NDRC on radar. During his visit he met with William D. Coolidge. Coolidge was shocked when Oliphant informed him that the British had predicted that only ten kilograms of uranium-235 would be sufficient to supply a chain reaction effected by fast moving neutrons. While in America, Oliphant discovered that the chairman of the OSRD S-1 Section, Lyman Briggs, had locked away the MAUD reports transferred from Britain entailing the initial discoveries and had not informed the S-1 Committee members of all its findings.Oliphant took the initiative himself to enlighten the scientific community in the U.S. of the recent ground breaking discoveries the MAUD Committee had just exposed.

In English-language sources it is usually referred to as the Imperial German Air Service, although that is not a literal translation of either name. German naval aviators serving with the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" remained an integral part of the Imperial German Navy \\"(Kaiserliche Marine)\\". Both military branches, the army and navy, operated conventional aircraft, observation balloons and Zeppelins. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. - A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down several enemy aircraft during aerial combat. The actual number of aerial victories required to officially qualify as an \\"ace\\" has varied, but is usually considered to be five or more. The few aces among combat aviators have historically accounted for the majority of air-to-air victories in military history. - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - The Messerschmitt Bf 109, was a German World War II fighter aircraft that was the backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. The Bf 109 first saw operational service during the Spanish Civil War (1939) and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II (1945). It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the superior Focke-Wulf Fw 190. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - Squadron leader (Sqn Ldr in the RAF and PAF; SQNLDR in the RAAF and RNZAF; formerly sometimes S/L in all services) is a commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence.

Throughout World War II, the DAF was made up of squadrons from the Royal Air Force (RAF), the South African Air Force (SAAF), the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and other Allied air forces. - Hans-Joachim Marseille (13 December 1919 30 September 1942) was a \\"Luftwaffe\\" fighter pilot and flying ace during World War II. He is noted for his aerial battles during the North African Campaign and his Bohemian lifestyle. One of the most successful fighter pilots, he was nicknamed the \\"Star of Africa\\". Marseille claimed all but seven of his \\"official\\" 158 victories against the British Commonwealth's Desert Air Force over North Africa, flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter for his entire combat career. No other pilot claimed as many Western Allied aircraft as Marseille. - Squadron Leader Derek Harland Ward , DFC & Bar , was a New Zealand flying ace during the Second World War .

Young Mr. Lincoln is filled up with some 'old-fashioned' values, which in retrospect, despite its two-dimensional portrayal, is at least more respectably done than one might see in the pap in current cinema. What makes it work so extremely well as it does, in all its simplicity and grandeur, is that its a truly great courtroom drama in the guise of a history lesson. We all know of Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president that did the emancipation and after the Civil war got assassinated. But as the lawyer in his earlier years he was charismatic, funny in the most unexpected places, and a true gentleman. He's not some superhero that can do no wrong (which was Fonda's only apprehension to the part before signing on), but a figure with possible flaws that are surpassed by his innate goodness and clear sight of right and wrong. It's suffice to say that John Ford is exceptional as a storyteller almost without trying. Actually, it's a lie, he does try, but he makes it sort of effortless in the studio system; he worked in an independent manner while also pleasing simultaneously Zanuck, so he was pretty much left alone to his own succinct practices in \\"editing in camera\\", and not moving it around so as to not waver far off from the story. It's this strength of conventional wisdom that somehow works hand in hand with the material, as a kind of companion piece to the full-blooded Americana in 1939 as seen in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (only here it's the law and not politics). Fonda is terrific in the lead- his first with Ford- and never lets us loose sight of Lincoln past the make-up and extra boost in the shoes. Fonda's own personality, in a sense, as it would in Grapes of Wrath and My Darling Clementine, comes out in the character of Lincoln. However unlikely it might be, there's no one else from this period that could have played him then: he's mature and wise, but has the gumption to prove himself in this case of a convoluted he-saw-that-but-did-she murder case. Only in little bits and pieces, like that final shot which superimposes Lincoln walking down the road with his monument, and a couple of small instances during that big parade scene early on, seem pretty dated. As far as the goals set out with Young Mr. Lincoln, there were all met by Ford and his crew and cast; it's not as hokey as one might think going in, and it's got a strong balance of humor and genuine pathos.

'Penetrating' in this context is often used to convey the depth or intensity of the movie, suggesting that the film manages to delve deeply into the subject matter or theme it tackles. This could refer to multiple aspects: the level of insight the narrative provides, the intensity of the performance of the actors, or the ability of the film to evoke strong emotional responses - all indicative of high-quality filmmaking. The term 'potent exploration' also adds to this positive impression. 'Potent' signifies that the film is powerful or highly effective. The term 'exploration' suggests the movie ventures into examining its themes or narrative thoroughly. Therefore, the term 'potent exploration' implies a powerful examination or investigation. It can only be assumed that the critic was impressed by the film's approach to its subject matter – whether it dealt with complex characters, intricate plots, or deep themes and motifs. In conclusion, it would seem safe to say that the terms 'penetrating' and 'potent exploration' highlight the critic's appreciation of the movie's depth and insightful, powerfully effective handling of its subject matter. It indicates a positive impression, most likely complimenting the director's efforts, the storytelling techniques, the acting, or a combination of these elements. The overall feel from this concise review is that the movie has been impactful, thought-provoking, and appreciable, delivering a deep, detailed and powerful understanding of its theme or narrative.

Article: As part of their investigation into his death, the NYPD recovered two diaries from the Manhattan apartment of Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffman died on Feb. 2 at the age of 46. According to police sources, the Oscar winner was found with bags of heroin and a needle in his arm. He left behind a long-time girlfriend and three children, as well as many friends who mourned the actor last week at a private funeral in Manhattan. Inside George Clooney's Last Dinner with Philip Seymour Hoffman His diaries did not include suicidal thoughts or chronicles of drug activity, according to sources who saw them, though the entries did provide insight into the actor's state of mind. The private journals contained musings about his struggle with addiction, as well as thoughts that were tough to decipher. Some entries were legible, while others less so, and one person who saw the books said that some entries appear to either be disassociated ramblings or a creative exercise. Detectives have returned the journals, along with other personal belongings, to Hoffman's family. -- This embed didnt make it to copy for story id = 22470049. ||||| At the beginning of this month, Philip Seymour Hoffman had two films in the can — Anton Corbijn's thriller A Man Wanted and the crime drama God's Pocket — and plans to appear in the next two Hunger Games films. He was preparing to star in a Showtime series, Happyish, and to direct Amy Adams and Jake Gyllenhaal in Ezekiel Moss. He was primed to launch into the next phase of his already-brilliant career. \\"He wanted to be done with playing the sad-sack loser, the guy who's jerking off,\\" his close friend, the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, says. Peter Travers on Philip Seymour Hoffman's most brilliant roles But all those plans went to dust on Sunday, February 2nd. That morning, Mimi O'Donnell, Hoffman's longtime partner and mother of their three children, texted David Bar Katz, another one of Hoffman's playwright friends, because the actor hadn't shown up to pick up their kids. Katz went to Hoffman's temporary apartment, where he'd been living for a few months after falling off the wagon, two blocks away from his family's home. That's where he found a generation's most brilliant actor — dead in the bathroom, a needle in his left arm. Hoffman's closest friends and colleagues remember the greatest actor of a generation in the new issue of Rolling Stone (on stands Friday), telling contributing editor David Browne intimate stories about an actor who \\"played those characters so well because he knew about guilt and shame and suffering,\\" as one friend said. Here are five revelations from the story: Hoffman's Death Didn't Come at the End of a \\"Downward Spiral\\" The actor's closest confidants say if anything, \\"he was on an upward spiral,\\" as Katz tells us. Hoffman \\"believed you don't have to die with a needle in your arm to be a great artist,\\" Guirgis says. The actor was still immersed in his craft with an intensity that could intimidate his castmates. Playing Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman Changed Hoffman \\"That play tortured him,\\" says Katz, and close friends say Hoffman wasn't the same after he threw himself into playing the tragic character — breaking into tears nightly — on Broadway in 2012. \\"He was miserable throughout that entire run.

Friends Say Hoffman's Final Bender Wasn't a Suicidal Streak, But a Relapse Turned Deadly \\"The addiction was always trying to find a way back in, and it started with the idea that the kid was an addict, and now he's an adult with incredible willpower,\\" says Katz. (Hoffman checked himself into rehab at 22 after spending college at NYU partying hard). \\"He was a guy in his midforties who said to himself, 'I never had a drink in my adult life.' So maybe the adult thought he could handle it.\\" Friends Dispute the Police Report Cops reported finding around 50 small bags of heroin in Hoffman's apartment, some used and some unopened. \\"I don't believe those reports, because I was there,\\" Katz tells us. \\"I didn't go through his drawers, but I'd never known Phil to put anything in a drawer.

The Oscar winner was “caught in between” his relationship with longtime girlfriend Mimi O’Donnell and a woman with whom he he’d recently hooked up, according to his journals, law-enforcement sources told The Post on Tuesday. Hoffman implied that his new gal pal was one reason O’Donnell — the mother of his three young children — might have bounced him from their Jane Street pad about three months ago, sources said. O’Donnell also didn’t want the drug-addled Hoffman living with her and their kids while he was still using, sources have said. She hoped the tough love would make him get clean faster. The 46-year-old “Capote’’ star — who died of an apparent heroin overdose Feb. 2 — also painfully wrote about the addiction that would eventually kill him, the sources said. He felt “ashamed that he was going out and hanging out and drinking” after having been sober for so long, sources said. The portly actor had first gone through rehab right out of college, and then remained clean for about 23 years before his tragic relapse. Hoffman wrote that he was haunted by “demons” and was desperately trying to control his addictions by attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings, NBC reported. He also wrote about scoring his drugs, with some of the entries appearing to have been penned while he was in rehab, the network said. The two scribbled diaries are hard to read, multiple sources said, with some passages starting out clearly enough but then degenerating into an illegible scrawl, suggesting that Hoffman wrote them while he was wasted. “It’s stream of consciousness and difficult to follow,” one source told NBC. “In one line, he refers to ‘Frank who always owes money,’ and on the same page, he writes about a 15-year-old girl from Texas.” Another source added, “It seems he did at least part of it in rehab. It definitely contained some soul-searching. But there is also a fair amount of rambling that doesn’t make sense.” Hoffman was found dead in his West Village pad with a needle still stuck in his arm. His place was littered with empty heroin envelopes and syringes. More than 40 full bags of the drug also were also recovered. Cops discovered the pair of small diaries — one about 6-by-8 inches and another about 7-by-9 inches — while searching the place. |||||Summary:","completion":"The NYPD recovered two diaries from the Manhattan apartment of Philip Seymour Hoffman as part of their investigation into his death. Hoffman died on Feb. 2 at the age of 46, found with bags of heroin and a needle in his arm. His diaries did not include suicidal thoughts or chronicles of drug activity, but they provided insight into the actor's state of mind. Containing musings about his struggle with addiction and some less decipherable thoughts, the diaries were returned to Hoffman's family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise states there is a question about the coach's name: \\"yeah who's the coach's name.\\" This suggests that the person asking does not currently know the coach's name. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that \\"I know who the coach is.\\" This statement implies the speaker has knowledge of the coach's identity. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. In the premise, the user doesn't know the coach's name. However, the hypothesis claims that the speaker knows the coach's identity – which likely indicates knowing their name as well. Step 4: Draw a conclusion. While it's not entirely clear whether the speaker is the same person in both the premise and the hypothesis, we can try to infer a connection. If we assume the speaker is the same, they indicated that they did not know the coach’s name in the premise, but the hypothesis indicates they do.

Though the promoter behind the concert she gave in Monterrey on Saturday offered to put her up in a hotel for the night, she made a last-minute decision to take off. He explains that in a call with Jenni and her rep at 2:30am, \\"they informed us that she had changed her plans and that they would be flying out right away to Toluca.\\" (Her plane went missing around 3:30am.) She said she needed to leave in order to appear at a singing competition in Mexico City. Two other equally gloomy updates: Rivera's family has finally been forced to give up hope that the singer was somehow, somehow still alive. Her remains have been IDed and turned over to the family, who have selected what CNN describes as an \\"ornate red urn\\" as her final resting place.

Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Jenni Rivera's Tragic Death: Last-minute Itinerary Change and its Implications\\" The untimely and tragic death of renowned Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera, known as the “Diva of Banda,” could have been avoided, according to a report by Fox News Latino. This heartbreaking revelation comes after more information emerges about a last-minute itinerary change made by the singer on the night of her fatal plane crash. Rivera, 43, performed on the night of December 8th, 2012, in Monterrey, Mexico and had planned to stay in the city for the night following her concert. It was reported that the concert promoter had arranged accommodations for Rivera and her entourage at a hotel in Monterrey. However, a last-minute change of plans saw her deciding to fly out of the city after her performance. In a statement by the concert promoter, he said that he had a call with Jenni Rivera and her representative at around 2:30 am, during which they informed him that the singer had changed her plans and would be immediately flying out to Toluca. The decision to leave Monterrey was attributed to Rivera's commitment to appear at a singing competition in Mexico City. Unfortunately, her plane went missing around 3:30 am, just an hour after her conversation with the concert promoter. The tragic events that ensued shook the music industry, especially her loyal fans in the Latino community. In further updates on this heart-wrenching story, Jenni Rivera's family has had to come to terms with the devastating reality that she was indeed deceased. The singer's remains have been identified and turned over to her family. CNN reported that the family selected an \\"ornate red urn\\" as Rivera's final resting place, symbolizing the deep love and respect they held for her. This tragic incident has also given rise to a scandal within the Mexican police force. Two Mexican police officers have been arrested on suspicion of stealing items from the crash site. The Associated Press reported that one of the officers had photos of the scene on his phone, which were discovered by police during their investigation into how the press was able to obtain gruesome photographs of the closed site. The revelation that Jenni Rivera's death could have been avoided has undoubtedly added to the immense grief her family, fans, and the music industry continue to experience. Her life and impact will always be remembered fondly, as Rivera remains an inspiration to many aspiring Latina artists and has left a lasting legacy in the world of Mexican music. As we ponder over the circumstances which led to Rivera's untimely passing, it serves as a somber reminder of the uncertainties of life. In honoring the memory of this talented and amazing artist, let us cherish her contributions to music and the powerful messages of love, hope, and unity she expressed through her work."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pepsi says its slim new diet cola can celebrates \\"beautiful, confident women.\\" Some say that's a message in bad taste Just in time for New York City's fashion week, Pepsi has introduced a skinny new can meant to complement \\"today's most stylish looks.\\" Photo: PEPSICO Best Opinion: Brand Channel, Slate, BNET The product: Just in time for New York's Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, Pepsi has introduced a new taller, skinnier can for its diet cola. PepsiCo says the new \\"Diet Pepsi Skinny Can\\" will \\"celebrate beautiful, confident women\\" and make for \\"the perfect complement to today's most stylish looks.\\" Commentators, however, aren't so sure the soda's sleek new cylinder sends a positive message. The reaction: On the surface, the new can is a smart way to \\"refresh\\" an old product, says Abe Sauer at Brand Channel. But Pepsi's marketing pitch equating \\"skinny\\" with \\"beautiful and confident\\" is a \\"tremendous shame.\\" Indeed, consumers expect a more \\"more sophisticated argument\\" than this, like Dove's \\"Campaign for Real Beauty,\\" says Libby Copeland at Slate. Pepsi's marketing pitch is particularly tone deaf because they're tying the new can to New York Fashion Week, says Jim Edwards at BNET. That's an \\"event with a history of favoring women whose body types are unusual at best and so unhealthy as to be fatal at worst.\\" Pepsi should \\"know better.\\" See the can makeover for yourself: ||||| Pepsi is promoting a “skinny” can for Fashion Week, a move that is sure to offend many women — especially when they read PepsiCo (PEP)’s press release. The statement suggests that there is a connection between beautiful, stylish, confident women and being tall and skinny: In celebration of beautiful, confident women, Diet Pepsi presents the taller, sassier new Skinny Can … Chief Marketing Officer Jill Beraud — who ought to know better — is quoted saying: Diet Pepsi has a long history of celebrating women through iconic fashion imagery seen in our infamous and historical campaigns, and we’re proud to continue that tradition as an official sponsor of Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. Our slim, attractive new can is the perfect complement to today’s most stylish looks, and we’re excited to throw its coming-out party during the biggest celebration of innovative design in the world. Got that, fat chicks? Pepsi is celebrating tall and skinny soda/women because that’s what’s confident and stylish! And was it a Freudian slip that the statement uses the word “infamous” instead of the word Beraud probably meant, “famous”? Pepsi wasn’t particularly “infamous” for its advertising previously, but this can design will help correct that. The backstory: The can actually has nothing to do with Fashion Week, although good luck getting that message across to the masses now that the grrrl blogosphere has gotten a hold of this. The alternate can redesign was previously unveiled in January and November. It hits at the retail level in March, weeks after Fashion Week is over. The can holds the same amount of cola — 12 oz — so the redesign is actually an excellent idea in terms of distinguishing it from Diet Coke and grabbing some of the heat that’s been generated by Red Bull et al. in the energy drink category. And you can probably fit more of them in the door of your fridge. But tying the can to an event with a history of favoring women whose body types are unusual at best and so unhealthy as to be fatal at worst? Not smart. Makes the old can look like your fat friend.

Preacher Cusack, played by an A-list actor, is a charismatic and mysterious figure. He has a magnetic presence that both captivates and intimidates the townspeople. Yet, despite his efforts to maintain a low profile, he can't escape the watchful eyes of the community, as they gradually become more fascinated with the stranger in their midst. The story is told from the perspective of a young, aspiring journalist named Emily, who returned to her hometown in search of inspiration and a sense of belonging after being fired from her job in the city. Emily, played by an up-and-coming actress, becomes intrigued by Preacher Cusack's enigmatic nature and makes it her personal mission to uncover the truth about his past. Emily starts attending his sermons, which are known for their life-changing impact and universal messages of love, forgiveness, and redemption. As Emily continues her investigative mission, she gradually uncovers a series of mysterious events surrounding Preacher Cusack. It becomes apparent that his visit to the town is not an accident, but rather a purposeful journey. In a shocking revelation, Emily discovers that Preacher Cusack is in town to confront a powerful local figure, played by a critically acclaimed actor, who turns out to be the cause of his troubled past. The powerful figure had unjustly framed Preacher Cusack, causing him to lose everything, including his family, when he was a young man. Preacher Cusack's plan is to expose the truth about this man and the atrocities he has committed. As the story unfolds, Preacher Cusack's inner turmoil and desire for retribution become evident, but so does his unwavering devotion to his faith and his commitment to spreading love and forgiveness, despite the bleakness of his past. In the climax of the movie, Preacher Cusack confronts the powerful figure in a highly emotional and dramatic scene. The community ultimately discovers the truth, leading to the powerful figure's downfall. Preacher Cusack, however, decides to forgive him, moving the town and demonstrating the power of redemption and the human capacity for change. In the end, Preacher Cusack leaves the town with a new purpose, traveling to other communities to spread his message of love, faith, and forgiveness – no matter the circumstances. Emily, having found purpose and inspiration, stays in her hometown and becomes a successful writer who often uses Preacher Cusack's teachings as inspiration for her articles, spreading his message in her own way. The movie is a touching and thought-provoking depiction of the human spirit's ability to overcome adversity and find redemption through love, compassion, and forgiveness, leaving the audience contemplating their own capacity for change and the impact of their actions on others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

O'Neill was born in a hotel, the Barrett House, at Broadway and 43rd Street, on what was then Longacre Square (now Times Square). A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. After suffering from multiple health problems (including depression and alcoholism) over many years, O'Neill ultimately faced a severe Parkinsons-like tremor in his hands which made it impossible for him to write during the last 10 years of his life; he had tried using dictation but found himself unable to compose in that way. While at Tao House, O'Neill had intended to write a cycle of 11 plays chronicling an American family since the 1800s. Only two of these, A Touch of the Poet and More Stately Mansions, were ever completed. As his health worsened, O'Neill lost inspiration for the project and wrote three largely autobiographical plays, The Iceman Cometh, Long Day's Journey into Night, and A Moon for the Misbegotten. He managed to complete Moon for the Misbegotten in 1943, just before leaving Tao House and losing his ability to write. Drafts of many other uncompleted plays were destroyed by Carlotta at Eugene's request. O'Neill died in Room 401 of the Sheraton Hotel (now Boston University's Shelton Hall) on Bay State Road in Boston, on November 27, 1953, at the age of 65. As he was dying, he whispered his last words: \\"I knew it. I knew it. Born in a hotel room and died in a hotel room.\\" Dr. Harry Kozol, the lead prosecuting expert of the Patty Hearst trial, treated O'Neill during these last years of illness. He also was present for O'Neill's death and announced the fact to the public. O'Neill is interred in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood. In 1956 Carlotta arranged for his autobiographical play Long Day's Journey into Night to be published, although his written instructions had stipulated that it not be made public until 25 years after his death. It was produced on stage to tremendous critical acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957. This last play is widely considered to be his finest. Other posthumously-published works include A Touch of the Poet (1958) and More Stately Mansions (1967). The United States Postal Service honored O'Neill with a Prominent Americans series (1965-1978) 1 postage stamp.

It has one \\"star\\" and it is John Rhys Davies. He is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling, magical flying baddie he is cast here. The rest of these people couldn't act their way out of a junior high school play. No clichés were missed in the dialogue, and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible. It is fairly easy to see that somebody in Asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at. Or maybe it was a director or a writer that needed a credit. My guess is that any career with this movie in it's credential Do yourself a major favor and don't watch this movie. A hundred Thanksgivings couldn't consume this turkey. The one funny scene was unintentional. The brother of the King appears on the scene. The king? A handsome, older, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) The brother? A six foot European. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for this.

The review starts by comparing the movie with \\"Gentle Rain,\\" which is considered the worst in history, and goes on to declare that this movie was even worse, indicating deep dissatisfaction. 2. Negative descriptions are consistently used to talk about cast members such as \\"John Rhys Davies is way out of shape\\" and \\"the rest of these people couldn't act their way out of a junior high school play,\\" showing disappointment in the acting. 3. The reviewer criticizes the movie by pointing out clichés in dialogue and subpar special effects. These remarks emphasize the reviewer's disappointment in the movie's quality. 4. The reviewer speculates that the movie was made for financial reasons rather than artistic merit, which highlights dissatisfaction with the intentions behind the production of the movie. 5. The suggestion to \\"do yourself a major favor and don't watch this movie\\" is a strong recommendation urging others to avoid the film. 6. A sarcastic remark, referring to the movie a \\"turkey,\\" demonstrates disdain and disapproval. 7. The description of how the casting choice for the King and his brother is ludicrous, reinforces this negative sentiment. Overall, the reviewer's abundance of critical comments and negative observations clearly indicate a negative sentiment about the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It didn't mention anything about returning the slicer, so the choice 'They explain how they returned the bread slicer' does not make sense. The story also didn't give any information about buying bread from a bakery, so 'They explain how they bought bread at the bakery' is not suitable. 'None of the above choices' is wrong because there's a suitable choice among the options. So, it makes sense to think that they might next talk about making homemade bread.

NHS bosses have said the unit will be one of 10 hospitals nationally that can continue to provide congenital heart surgery for children and adults. The Leeds General Infirmary unit first came under threat in 2011, prompting a huge campaign to keep it open. City council leader Judith Blake said the news ended a long period of doubt. Congenital heart disease services have been the subject of a number of reviews since a public inquiry at Bristol Royal Infirmary in 2001. In 2011, the children's heart surgery unit in Leeds was earmarked for closure in an NHS review that was eventually declared flawed. It was back under the spotlight in 2013 when surgery was suspended amid concerns about death rates. Later, an investigation found the decision was based on \\"invalidated and incomplete data\\". Last year NHS England published updated standards for specialist heart care and has since been assessing which hospitals are meeting the new criteria. It has now announced which trusts are not meeting the standards and which need to close services and transfer care elsewhere. Units in in Leicester, Manchester and London have been told to halt complex surgery on patients born with heart problems by April 2017. Five other hospitals providing treatments other than complex surgery will have to stop those services too. NHS England said it would continue to support and monitor progress at Leeds' hospital trust. Julian Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, praised congenital heart disease staff who he said had done an \\"outstanding job\\" in complying with the \\"rigorous new national standards\\". Sharon Coyle, chief executive of Leeds Children's Heart Surgery Fund, tweeted: \\"Delighted for Leeds heart unit, my thoughts are with Leicester patients and the Brompton.\\" This article was about:","completion":"This article is about a hospital unit in Leeds General Infirmary that can continue to provide heart surgery for children and adults with congenital heart disease.

Options: A: he can do nothing except it B: he likes to stay in the quiet forest C: he can't get on well with others D: he is very strong Answer:","completion":"Henry has to cut down the trees because A: he can do nothing except it. In the article, it is mentioned that Henry is the strongest and youngest, but he knows little and does not like to use his head. This implies that he is not skilled at many tasks, leading to the fact that he is assigned unskilled work. When winter is approaching, and the workers are getting ready for the next year, Henry still does nothing. The farmer, noticing Henry's lack of activity, tells him to cut down some trees in the forest, likely because this is a task that does not require extensive knowledge, and Henry's strength should allow him to perform the task. Although it is mentioned that Henry becomes afraid of the animals in the forest and feels lonely, the article does not say that he likes to stay in the quiet forest (option B). There is also no evidence in the article to suggest that Henry has problems getting along with others (option C). While it is true that Henry is strong (option D), this fact does not directly explain why he is asked to cut down trees. The primary reason he is given this task is that it is among the few tasks that match his limited abilities and knowledge. Thus, the most accurate answer for the question is option A: he can do nothing except it."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Let me explain. Question 1: \\"How can I make a career with Blender 3D?\\" A career with Blender 3D would mean you would use this program called Blender for your job. Blender is a very powerful tool that you can use to make 3D animations and graphics, like in the movies and video games. To make a career, first you'd need to learn how to use Blender really well. You might take classes, watch videos, or read books to learn. Then you could start doing small projects, like short animations or simple video games. After a while, you might be good enough to work for a company, or even start your own company! Question 2: \\"What are some honest reviews of Blender 3D?\\" Reviews are like report cards for products. They tell you what’s good and what's not so good. If you were to ask for reviews, someone might tell you that Blender 3D is great because it's free to use and has lots of features. But they might also say that it's complicated to learn. These comments would help you understand if Blender is the right tool for you to learn and use.

A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. x = 10, equation weights = [8, 6, 2]","completion":"To compute the result of the polynomial expression by substituting the given value of x, we can use the equation weights and the given value of x.

Laura was a better writer than Betty, so Options: -- Laura was chosen to write the blog for the company.; -- Betty was chosen to write the blog for the company.;","completion":"Laura was a better writer than Betty, so naturally one would assume that Laura would be the obvious choice for the company's content needs. In fact, Laura was chosen to write the blog for the company at first. She was adept at producing engaging, informative, and relevant content that appealed to the company's target audience. Her writing was clear, concise, and always reflected a perfect balance between professionalism and friendliness. The company recognized her skill and entrusted her with their brand's voice, confident that she would excel in her role and make the content stand out. Laura's decision to allocate her creative energies to the company's blog proved to be a wise one. When readers visited the blog, they were greeted with well-written posts that they found both compelling and easy to understand. Laura's talent for storytelling made the company blog stand out amongst competitors, painting the company in a positive light and fostering a strong sense of community among readers. Gradually, the blog expanded its readership, leading to increased traffic on the website. Laura's diligent research and attention to detail provided a wealth of knowledge for those who sought information about the company and its related industry. Subscribers began to perceive the brand as a reliable source of insight, and the company enjoyed a jump in reputation as its blog became a trusted resource. During this time, Betty had been watching Laura's success with a mixture of admiration and envy. She knew that she didn't possess the same level of writing prowess as her colleague, but she wanted to contribute her own skills to the company in a meaningful way. Laura recognized Betty's passion and came up with a plan that would utilize her unique talents. With Laura's encouragement, Betty began to collaborate on the blog by focusing on a different aspect of it: visuals and design. Betty's eye for aesthetics complemented Laura's impressive writing skills, resulting in a blog that was now not only well-written but visually appealing as well. The combination of impactful imagery and high-quality content further enhanced the reputation of the company blog, creating an immersive, professional experience for readers. As time went on, the company began to assign more responsibility to Betty to create visual content for other company projects such as presentations, e-books, and merchandise designs. Betty flourished in her new role, and her contributions helped strengthen the company's brand identity. Despite her initial limitations as a writer, Betty's determination and willingness to learn allowed her to become a vital component of the company's overall success. In conclusion, while Laura's superior writing skills initially led to her being chosen to write the blog for the company, Betty would eventually find her niche in the visual aspect of the project. Together, they formed a dynamic duo capable of producing a blog that was as captivating to the eye as it was compelling to read. Their teamwork, bolstered by the support and understanding shown by the company, played a crucial role in bolstering the company's online presence and fostering a sense of community amongst their readers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function.

News article: Horace Mann Students Repeat Poetsâ Slurs, to Schoolâs Dismay The poets had set the tone for the exercise by reading a poem they had written together, which uses startling, offensive language and has in its first three lines the harshest slurs against blacks and gays. The same slurs emerged on the cards, written by students in anonymity, then read out loud by peers who picked the cards at random from a pile stacked on a desk. The reading went on uninterrupted for 30 minutes at least, one of the poets, Denise Duhamel, recalled in an interview on Friday. According to articles published on Friday in the school’s newspaper, The Horace Mann Record, it set off a mix of disconcerted laughter, confusion and, most of all, soul-searching among teachers and the 700 students in the audience at first, and then throughout the school. By Tuesday afternoon, David Schiller, the head of the school’s upper division, had visited many classrooms, apologizing. Dr. Schiller declined to comment, beyond providing a letter he sent to parents on Thursday, in which he took the blame for what had happened. “It was my responsibility to ensure that the presentation to our students was fitting and appropriate. It was not,” he wrote. “I should have intervened to stop the assembly, and I did not do so.” Ms. Duhamel, 51, a creative writing professor at Florida International University, said that she and the other poet, Maureen Seaton, also a creative writing professor in Florida, could not hear what was being read from the cards because they were seated behind the students, who faced the audience as they read the words into a microphone. Their first clues of what had transpired came from a group of teachers who approached them after the assembly, which was for grades 9 through 12, saying they were sorry for the derogatory language that had been used. But it was not until the poets toured some of the classes that the story began to come out, Professor Duhamel said. “What would we have done if we’d heard it? We ourselves probably would have been in shock,” she said. “I honestly don’t know what we would have done if we had heard it. We invited them to express themselves, and then they did.” In articles in the elite school’s newspaper, students expressed feelings of guilt, shame and outrage, some for reading the cards even if the words bothered them, others for allowing the reading to go on for so long. Several seemed unsurprised about the tone and choices of words. “There were some people who said that this was a long time coming, and they definitely recognized this attitude in Horace Mann students,” Katie Bierenboim, a senior, said. In an opinion piece published in the newspaper, Esther Ademola, who is black, wrote: “Words and ideas were thrown around that I’ve heard expressed in hallways, classrooms and the cafeteria. I personally have been subject to remarks much worse than those shared on stage.” Professor Duhamel said that in spite of the language in the poem that she and Professor Seaton chose to get the event started, she did not see the result coming. “We’d read that poem before,” she said, “and we were told it was a very sophisticated group of teenagers.” The poets — whose work discusses topics like homosexuality, domestic abuse and heartbreak — were among many artists and authors to visit the school over the years, Dr. Schiller wrote in his letter. Professor Duhamel and Professor Seaton, who are white, were invited by one of the school’s English teachers, Harry Bauld; the school gave them an honorarium that covered travel costs, Ms. Duhamel said. Mr. Bauld could not be reached for comment, but in an e-mail to the school paper, he wrote, “What they did was follow my lead and set up what they expected would provide a collaborative, fun, energetic, creative exercise.” Dr. Schiller told parents that the school had no intention of ending visits, but that he would ensure the content of future assemblies was “appropriate and conforms to our school values.” The poem read by the professors, he said, “was filled with profanity” and “included hateful and highly antagonistic language.” Professor Duhamel said it is, in fact, a poem against “the patriarchal structure” and seeks to dispel the notion of “gayness” by using words that blunt the idea that “gay lives are somehow different from straight ones.” Professor Seaton, who could not be reached for comment, is a lesbian. Dr. Schiller, in his letter, said he hoped “a healthful and healing process” had begun. In her piece, Ms. Ademola, the black student, wrote, “All we can do is take this opportunity to re-examine our values.” She went on: “We need to have a culture in which it’s normal to hear people speaking up not only when they feel attacked but also when others are being victimized. I for one will no longer be silenced by my fear.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

The Conquest of Melilla occurred in September 1497, when a fleet sent by the Duke of Medina Sidonia seized the north African city of Melilla., as continuation of Reconquest of Mauritania Tingitana During the 15th century the mediterranean cities of the Sultanate of Fez fell in decadence in opposition to cities located in the Atlantic facade, which concentrated most of the economic activity. By the end of the 15th century, the port of Melilla, that had been often disputed between the rulers of Fez and Tlemcen, was nearly abandoned. Plans for the conquest occurred as soon as the Fall of Granada in 1492. Spanish captains Lezcano and Lorenzo Zafra visited the coast of Northern Africa to identify possible locations for the Spanish to overtake, and Melilla was identified as a prime candidate. Melilla was, however, in the Portuguese zone of influence under the terms of the 1479 Treaty of Alcáçovaz. At Tordesillas in 1494, King John II of Portugal, the Portuguese ruler agreed to make an exception and permitted the Spanish to attempt the conquest of Melilla. The duke sent Pedro Estopiñán who conquered the city virtually without a fight in 1497, as internal conflicts had depleted it of troops, and its defenses were weakened. The Wattasid ruler Muhammad al-Shaykh sent a detachment of cavalrymen to retake control of the city, but they were repulsed by the guns of the Spanish ships.

(B). no.","completion":"(A). Yes. The sentence \\"The second son, Ordoño, reigned in Galicia, while the third, Fruela, received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital.\\" indeed contains the correct answer to \\"Who was the second son of Alfonso III and what did he become king of?\\" Alfonso III, also known as Alfonso the Great, was the King of Asturias from 866 to 910. He was the son of Ordoño I and had three sons: Garcia, Ordoño, and Fruela. Alfonso III's reign was marked by his successful efforts to consolidate and expand the kingdom, which laid the foundation for the later Kingdom of León and eventually the unification of Christian kingdoms under the monarchy of Spain. The second son of Alfonso III was Ordoño, who became the king of Galicia. Galicia is a historical region located in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, including parts of modern-day Spain and Portugal. King Ordoño II of Galicia (c. 873 – 924) ruled the region in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. His reign was characterized by struggles against the Moors, who had been residing in the southern parts of the Iberian Peninsula since the early 8th century. Ordoño II played a crucial role in strengthening the Christian kingdoms and furthering the Reconquista, the effort to reclaim Iberian territories from the Moors. The sentence in question also mentions Fruela, the third son of Alfonso III. Fruela received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital, which indicates that he became the ruler of Asturias after his father's death. Fruela II of Asturias (c. 875 – 925) was a key figure in continuing the Reconquista efforts initiated by his father, and under his rule, the foundation for the future Kingdom of León was further solidified. Fruela II later became the first king of the united Kingdom of León and Asturias.

Whether you are creating a blog or using YouTube, you need to have an attention-grabbing moniker. This can be something simple, such as your given name and “video game reviews” after your name, or you can build a brand from the ground up, creating an entirely new name, website graphics, and even a theme song or jingle. You can use YouTube or start a blog to create an online presence, but having some sort of venue online with which to provide your review is essential. If you start a YouTube channel, make sure you have a decent video camera and a place to set up. Some people make great money via YouTube, and have even gone so far as to make it their full-time job. This is rare, and can take years of hard work, so don’t expect a quick payout. Start reviewing new games; most people will not be interested in older ones. When a new game comes out, you can either buy it or rent it, though buying it will make making a profit difficult. When you review, touch on what makes the game great, what it is lacking in, and what type of audience it is best suited for. Know your audience. If you are targeting videogame players directly, speak or write as though you are talking to players. If you are targeting parents of videogame players, use language that explains games clearly to a novice. Encourage them to share with others if they like what they see. The best way to build your business is to get your name out there. Even if you feel embarrassed or silly, tell your family and friends what you are doing, and ask them to please share your website or channel if they like what they see. This is a simple, easy way to garner more interest in your site. In social media, hashtags are quite useful in linking your name to the names of others who are doing similar work. Whether you are using Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter to talk about your new venture, make sure you are using hashtags. .YouTube videos have the option of including ads, which can help you start out in making money, while blogs have the option of using affiliate links and programs such as Google AdSense.

First, we have this math problem: -139*b - 6279 - 2369 = -38*b + 87*b Let's look at the equation like two teams: Team 1 (left side): -139*b - 6279 - 2369 Team 2 (right side): -38*b + 87*b Now, let's start by helping out the first team by adding the two numbers: -139*b - 8648 (we added -6279 and -2369) So now our equation looks like: -139*b - 8648 = -38*b + 87*b Next, let's help the second team out by combining the b's: 49*b (we added -38*b and 87*b) Now, our equation looks like: -139*b - 8648 = 49*b To figure out what \\"b\\" is, we have to get all the \\"b\\" friends together on one side. So, let's add 139*b to both sides to bring them together: -139*b + 139*b - 8648 = 49*b + 139*b This simplifies to: -8648 = 188*b Now, we just need to find out how many times this 188*b can fit into -8648.

After years of demanding greater political autonomy, residents were given the right to directly elect a Head of Government and the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly by popular vote in 1997. Ever since, the left-wing Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) has controlled both of them. In recent years, the local government has passed a wave of liberal policies, such as abortion on request, a limited form of euthanasia, no-fault divorce, and same-sex marriage. On January 29, 2016, it ceased to be called the Federal District (Spanish: Distrito Federal or D.F.) and is now in transition to become the country's 32nd federal entity, giving it a level of autonomy comparable to that of a state. Because of a clause in the Mexican Constitution, however, as the seat of the powers of the Union, it can never become a state, lest the capital of the country be relocated elsewhere. How are officials elected to the legislature?","completion":"In the given scenario, residents were given the right to directly elect a Head of Government and the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly by popular vote in 1997. To understand how officials are elected to the legislature, let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Determine the electoral system The given information tells us that the election of the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly occurs through a popular vote. This means that the residents of the region directly choose their representatives. Step 2: Establish candidacy Individuals interested in running for office must declare their candidacy and be affiliated with a political party or run as an independent candidate, depending on the specific election rules of the region. They must meet any eligibility requirements such as age, residency, and other criteria established by the electoral laws. Step 3: Campaigning Candidates campaign to gain support from the residents by sharing their political views, policy proposals, and plans to address local issues. They participate in debates, engage with the community, and use various forms of media to communicate their message. Step 4: Voting On Election Day, eligible residents cast their votes for their preferred candidates in the elections for the Head of Government and the representatives of the unicameral Legislative Assembly. Voting is usually done in-person at designated polling stations or through alternative methods like mail-in voting, if available. Step 5: Counting votes and announcing results After the voting has concluded, the votes are counted, and the results are announced. The candidate with the most votes for the Head of Government position is declared the winner. For the unicameral Legislative Assembly, depending on the specific electoral system used (such as proportional representation or first-past-the-post), representatives are elected based on the number of votes they receive and/or the percentage of votes their party receives. Step 6: Swearing-in and assuming office Finally, the elected officials are sworn in and assume their duties as the Head of Government and members of the unicameral Legislative Assembly. In summary, officials are elected to the legislature through a popular vote system, where residents directly choose their representatives. The electoral process involves declaring candidacy, campaigning, voting, counting votes, announcing results, and swearing-in the elected officials."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which can last longer with out water a camel or a rat? What is the answer?","completion":"To find out which can last longer without water, a camel or a rat, I will look up their respective water consumption patterns and their ability to survive without water. Step 1: Research the camel's ability to survive without water. Camels are known for their superior ability to survive without water for extended periods. They store water in their humps, which consist of fatty tissue. In general, camels can go up to 7-10 days without drinking water due to their unique physiological adaptations that optimize water retention and usage. Step 2: Research the rat's ability to survive without water. Rats, as smaller mammals, have a higher metabolic rate, which means they need water more frequently compared to larger animals. They obtain water from both food and direct drinking. Rats cannot survive for more than a few days without water, depending on the availability of water from the food they're eating. Step 3: Compare the two animals' abilities to survive without water. Comparing the two animals shows that camels can survive without water for a much longer period (up to 7-10 days) than rats, which can only survive for a few days without water. Based on this comparison, I can conclude that a camel can last longer without water than a rat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Olympics is a huge sports event where athletes from countries all around the world come together to compete and win medals. It's like a big playground with lots of different games, but for grown-ups who are really, really good at those games. Something happened during the Olympics that made the Olympic Committee, which is a group of people who make sure everyone plays nice and follows the rules, look into what an athlete from Egypt did. This athlete is a judo fighter, which is a type of sport where people try to throw each other on the ground like in wrestling. Now, when athletes finish competing in a sport at the Olympics, they usually shake hands or hug to show good sportsmanship. This means that even if they didn't win, they are still friends and respect each other. But this time, the Egyptian judo fighter didn't want to shake hands with the athlete from Israel after their match. Israel is another country, and just like in a playground sometimes kids don't get along, countries can also have disagreements. Because it's not nice to snub or ignore someone like that, the Olympic Committee started investigating, or looking more closely into what happened. They want to make sure everyone at the Olympics follows the rules and is kind and respectful to each other. An investigation just means that these special grown-ups in the Olympic Committee will look at what happened, talk to the athletes, and find out why the Egyptian judo fighter chose not to shake hands with the athlete from Israel. Once they know the whole story and understand what happened, they will make a decision about what to do next. This could include teaching the athletes how to be better friends or giving them a warning.

The sounds of nature harmonize with the gentle whispers of the wind; the chirping birds form a natural symphony that plays in the background, only occasionally interrupted by the distant laughter of playing children or the soft footsteps of friendly neighbors passing by. Living in the suburbs has its benefits: a peaceful ambience, uncongested surroundings, and an uncluttered lifestyle.

The request came after Shkreli walked into a courtroom full of reporters during a Friday lunch break in Brooklyn and shared his thoughts about the case. At one point, he called the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of New York \\"junior varsity,\\" according to accounts of several journalists who were there. Shkreli also told reporters that he hadn't prepared some of the internal documents that the government was using to try to prove he duped investors. And he derided a woman who'd testified against him, saying she couldn't have been a victim of any crime because she ended up making money, CNBC reported.

They accused Shkreli, who was banned from Twitter earlier this year for harassing a female journalist, of being behind an anonymous account that has been commenting on the trial. Related: Shkreli’s Trial Not On Drug Prices, But This ‘Ponzi-Like’ Scheme \\"If this behavior continues, it is only a matter of time before Shkreli, or a member of the public who is repeating Shkreli's statements, exposes one or more jurors to precisely the sort of extrajudicial evidence or commentary and our system forbids,\\" the prosecutors wrote. Shkreli's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman ─ who speculated in his opening statements that his client might be \\"just nuts\\" ─ responded by accusing the media of trying to \\"bait\\" his client, who he said was in a \\"frail emotional state\\" and trying to defend himself against \\"one-sided coverage.\\" While Brafman said he has told Shkreli to knock it off, a gag order would violate Shkreli's First Amendment rights, Brafman said. The filings were made on Monday, two days before the trial was set to resume before U.S. District Court Judge Kiyo Matsumoto. Shkreli, 34, became a target of public derision when he raised the price of an AIDS drug by more than 5,000 percent. His trial, where he faces eight counts of wire and securities fraud, aren't related to that move. They cover his time as portfolio manager of two hedge funds and the founder of pharmaceutical company Retrophin. Shkreli has continued to grab attention with various antics since his arrest, flaunting large purchases on social media, including a rare album by the rap group Wu-Tang Clan. ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Monday asked a U.S. judge for a gag order muzzling former drug company executive Martin Shkreli, on trial for securities fraud charges, arguing that his statements to media could taint the jury and disrupt the case, court papers show. Martin Shkreli, former chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals and KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc, departs after a hearing at U.S. Federal Court in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., June 26, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Shkreli’s attorney, Benjamin Brafman, asked the judge that day to reject the request on the grounds that his client had a First Amendment right to speak freely, according to the filings. Shkreli last week told reporters outside the court that an alleged victim of his was not actually a victim because she made money from his investments, attorneys for the U.S. government told U.S. Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in a letter on Monday. He also directly spoke on camera to a journalist and appeared to be commenting on the case on social media platform Twitter under the handle @BLMBro, they added. Brafman said Shkreli was in a delicate emotional state, and believed that the press focuses unfairly on some of his negative characteristics. “His comments are the somewhat natural, though unfortunate consequence of a young man with a demonstrated history of significant anxiety being at the center of a supremely difficult time in his life,” Brafman wrote in the filing. Dubbed the “pharma bro,” Shkreli, 34, gained notoriety for raising the price of a life-saving drug by 5,000 percent. The charges he faces stem from his management of pharmaceutical company Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O) and the hedge fund MSMB Capital Management from 2009 to 2014. Prosecutors have claimed that Shkreli engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in which he defrauded investors in MSMB and took 11 million in assets from Retrophin to repay them. Shkreli has pleaded not guilty to charges that include securities fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Federal prosecutors have asked Judge Matsumoto sequester the jury in the event that the court does not issue the gag order. In their letter, federal prosecutors said Shkreli visited reporters in a court breakroom last week and remarked on the credibility of witnesses who testified. Prosecutors also wrote that Shkreli on YouTube had identified himself as BLMBro. The BLMBro Twitter account has posted stories critical of witnesses and evidence in the trial, they added. Shkreli in January was suspended from Twitter for harassing a female journalist. Brafman has argued that Shkreli is a misunderstood genius who earned his wealthy investors millions of dollars. |||||","completion":"There's a man named Martin Shkreli who is currently on trial for some bad things he is accused of doing with money.

We have almost done nothing to improve our examination system. It is well known that the examination system we are now using may be a good way of testing a student's memory, but it can tell you nothing about a student's ability. It does no good to students and teachers. As soon as a child begins school, he enters a world of examination that will decide his future of job.

Besides, the examinations often force teachers to train students what to do with the coming examination from time to time.

THE FIRST EASTERN WAR. 215-183. Scipio remained in Africa till he had arranged matters and won such a claim to Massinissa's gratitude that this king of Numidia was sure to watch over the interests of Rome. Scipio then returned home, and entered Rome with a grand triumph, all the nobler for himself that he did not lead Hannibal in his chains. He had been too generous to demand that so brave an enemy should be delivered up to him. He received the surname of Africanus, and was one of the most respected and beloved of Romans. He was the first who began to take up Greek learning and culture, and to exchange the old Roman ruggedness for the graces of philosophy and poetry. Indeed the Romans were beginning to have much to do with the Greeks, and the war they entered upon now was the first for the sake of spreading their own power. All the former ones had been in self-defence, and the new one did in fact spring out of the Punic war, for the Carthaginians had tried to persuade Philip, king of Macedon, to follow in the track of Pyrrhus, and come and help Hannibal in Southern Italy. The Romans had kept him off by stirring up the robber Ætolians against him; and when he began to punish these wild neighbors, the Romans leagued themselves with the old Greek cities which Macedon oppressed, and a great war took place. Titus Quinctius Flaminius commanded in Greece for four years, first as consul and then as proconsul. His crowning victory was at Cynocephalæ, or the Dogshead Rocks, where he so broke the strength of Macedon that at the Isthmian games he proclaimed the deliverance of Greece, and in their joy the people crowded round him with crowns and garlands, and shouted so loud that birds in the air were said to have dropped down at the sound. 1.

Gerry and Joe leave the injured man a blanket, a canteen and a gun before driving off, supposedly to seek medical aid. As the hours go by and Carson realizes the truth of his predicament, he vows to live long enough to exact revenge against his wife and her accomplice. Carson is reported missing to police lieutenant Mike Platt and to Dave Emory, who is Carson's lawyer and business manager. Gerry doesn't mention the broken leg and claims her husband wandered off. Emory isn't yet too concerned because Carson is a temperamental alcoholic who has acted irresponsibly more than once. The lovers fly to Carson's mansion in Los Angeles knowing that Carson is a good 60 miles from where they told the police to look. They expect him to succumb to the desert heat or to shoot himself with the gun. Far more resourceful than they anticipated, Carson manages to make a splint, then crawl his way to an abandoned mine, where he uses timber for a makeshift crutch. He finds sustenance from the meat of a cactus and attempts in vain to shoot a rabbit with the gun.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard.

A:","completion":"Jesse rode the roller coaster fearfully as a result of multiple factors, primarily rooted in social dynamics and psychological processes. Here is a detailed analysis of why Jesse decided to take on this experience despite his fear: 1. Peer Pressure: One of the main reasons Jesse decided to ride the roller coaster was the influence and encouragement of his friends. Peer pressure is a powerful force and can significantly impact a person's decisions, especially when it comes to participating in activities that others are engaging in. In Jesse's case, the desire to fit in and not let his friends down may have been strong enough to override his own apprehensions about the roller coaster. 2. Fear of Social Rejection: The prospect of being rejected by his friends may have been even scarier for Jesse than the roller coaster itself. Human beings are social creatures, and the need for social acceptance and belonging is essential for mental wellbeing. Jesse may have been concerned about being labeled as a \\"party pooper\\" or seen as weak if he did not participate in the activity his friends were excited about, which could potentially lead to feelings of isolation and rejection. 3. Conforming to Social Norms: Since riding roller coasters is often considered a common activity in amusement parks, Jesse might have thought that this is something that he should be able to do without feeling scared. He might have wanted to conform to the established social norm, believing that if everyone else could do it, so should he. This form of \\"social proof\\" can be quite compelling and may have been enough to convince Jesse to summon the courage to face his fears. 4. Testing Personal Limitations: Despite feeling afraid, Jesse may have decided to ride the roller coaster as a way to challenge and test himself. He might have been motivated by a desire to overcome his fears or prove his bravery, not only to his friends but also to himself. Many people use such experiences as an opportunity for self-growth, facing their fears head-on in the hope of subsequently gaining a sense of accomplishment and personal development. 5. The Bandwagon Effect: Jesse's friends were likely a significant source of his decision to ride. The bandwagon effect is a phenomenon where people are more likely to participate in activities because others are doing so, regardless of their personal preferences or opinions. In this situation, Jesse might have thought that if his friends were excited about the roller coaster, there must be something enjoyable or worthwhile about the experience. This could have led him to second-guess his own fears and give into the inertia of the group's enthusiasm. In conclusion, Jesse's decision to ride the roller coaster fearfully can be attributed to multiple interconnected factors ingrained in the complexities of human psychology and social dynamics. Peer pressure, fear of social rejection, conforming to social norms, testing personal limitations, and the bandwagon effect all played a role in Jesse's choice to face his fears and participate in the thrilling ride his friends pressured him to try."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there.

Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

Options: - The driver yearns for the outdoors. - The driver has a lot of jewelry - The driver likes commercial advertising - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The correct answer is: The driver yearns for the outdoors. This is inferred from the driver's action of printing and putting up an image of Maxfield Parrish's mountains, featuring the beauty of nature, on a billboard. The driver's detailed and appreciative description of the painted landscape also suggests a love for the outdoors. This action contrasts with the commercial advertisements that typically populate the billboards, indicating a weariness or disinterest towards constant commercialization.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long does someone need to stay on the Mediterranean diet for? Options: - As long as they would like - not enough information - until it gets too expensive - on occasion Answer:","completion":"not enough information"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Article: There is a saying, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" Although eating properly is important, being kind to others is also good tor your health. Studies show that people who perform kind acts are more relaxed, happier, and healthier than other people. In one study at Arizona State University researchers, found that many volunteers experienced a sudden feeling of joy, followed by a long period of calm, after performing a kind act. This feeling, called \\"a help's high\\" may actually help reduce stress as the body releases naturally painkillers.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: The best time for a nap is between 12pm and 3pm, at which point your melatonin levels are highest and your energy level tends to be lowest. If you struggle with after-lunch drowsiness, grabbing a few minutes of nap can make you more productive and awake in the long-run, as opposed to gulping down an energy drink and trying to press on. Try to avoid naps after 4pm, especially if you struggle with insomnia. Sleeping too late in the day can make it harder to get to sleep at night, when you want to go to sleep. Grabbing 10-20 minutes of rest is usually best for a middle-of-the-day nap. More than that can leave you feeling drowsier than when you started, meaning you'll have to go through the whole waking-up process for the second time in the day. Alternatively, if you need a serious nap because you slept poorly the previous night, Try to aim for a full REM cycle of 90 minutes. Sleeping for 60 minutes can make you feel groggy for the rest of the day, whereas 90 minutes--a full sleep cycle--can leave you feeling refreshed. The idea of nodding off for too long can keep some people from actually falling asleep. Take the stress off and set an alarm, even if it's only 15 minutes from now, to wake you back up and get you back to whatever you've got to do. You can rest easy knowing you're not going to wake up when it's dark outside. Use your phone to set a quick alarm, or get a coworker to cover for you and knock on your door in 15 minutes. Then return the favor. While it may sound counterintuitive to drink a cup of coffee right before you go to sleep, caffeine's got to travel all the way through your digestive tract before you feel that caffeinated jolt--a process that takes about 20 minutes--so some pro nappers swear by the caffeine nap, which times itself perfectly with your wake-up. Down a quick cup of cold coffee just before nodding off and let the caffeine wake you up sharp and refreshed. It's still a good idea to set an alarm to keep yourself from sleeping too late. Summary:","completion":"The best time to take a nap is between 12pm and 3pm when you feel sleepy, and try to take a short nap for about 10-20 minutes. If you're very tired, sleep for 90 minutes to feel refreshed. Don't nap after 4pm or it might be hard to sleep at night. Set an alarm so you don't sleep too long, and you can even have a small cup of coffee before your nap to help you wake up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Where was the barrel pointed when the sights were on a target? Is \\"In this method when the sights were on the target, the barrel was pointed at the target's future position.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"Yes, your statement is correct but it lacks detail. When aiming a firearm, whether it's a handgun, rifle, or shotgun, the barrel was typically pointed at the target if the sights were on a target. However, it isn't just as simple as that due to many factors that can determine if the bullet actually hits the intended target. These factors include the distance of the target, wind speed and direction, the speed and trajectory of the bullet, and gravity's effect on the bullet. To aim correctly and hit the target, you have to align the rear and front sights of the gun with the target. This alignment ensures that the barrel is aimed directly at the target. So, in a basic sense, this indeed implies that the barrel of the gun is pointed directly at the target when you have the sights on the target. In more advanced shooting scenarios, like hunting or sharpshooting, where targets could be moving and are farther away, you might aim the barrel at the target's future position (also known as leading the target) to anticipate the target's movement. This is especially important when shooting at a moving target at a distance because the bullet won't reach the target instantly; there's a delay due to the bullet's speed and the distance to the target. That's why professional sharpshooters always consider the target's speed, its direction, and many other factors to accurately point their barrel and hit the moving target. Moreover, this principle of pointing the barrel to the target's future position is also applied in military combat situations, shooting sports, and even in space applications where fast-moving objects are targeted. So while your statement is correct, it is only applicable in specific scenarios (such as shooting at a moving target), and pointing the barrel at the target's future position requires considerable skill, experience, and calculation. Depending on the type of gun used and the context, trajectory, wind speed, bullet speed, and many other factors can significantly affect where the barrel should be aimed, even when the sights are on the target."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever.

Matthew Radar's mother said he was always a climber, and it ultimately led him to his death. The child found a container of cinnamon powder, ate it and died from asphyxiation. \\"He was completely healthy - no problems,\\" Brianna Radar, the boy's mother, said. \\"He started choking. It was like he was having a seizure and just collapsed.\\" Matthew was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead an hour and a half later. The coroner ruled the death was accidental and said cinnamon asphyxiation is a common problem when the powder is inhaled. While Matthew was choking on the cinnamon, some of it got into his lungs and caused his death. Radar said she hopes teenagers who are participating in the social media stunt known as the \\"cinnamon challenge\\" will realize the dangers of ingesting large amounts of cinnamon as a result of her son's death, though it is an unrelated incident. In the cinnamon challenge, people record a video of themselves attempting to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon without water. Many of the videos include the participants coughing violently when they are unable to do it. \\"Cinnamon can kill,\\" Radar said. \\"All these kids, they don't think about the fact it can hurt them.\\" Radar said Matthew's organs were donated in the hopes his death will help save other lives.

Brianna Rader's son Matthew was completely healthy. But Wednesday morning, when he explored the kitchen at his Mother's apartment and found a bottle of cinnamon, Rader's worst nightmare came true. \\"He started choking, it was like he was having a seizure and just collapsed,\\" Radar said. Matthew was rushed to ER but it was too late. He died 90 minutes later. The coroner calls his death accidental, saying the cinnamon can caused asphyxiation \\"He choked on it, it got into his lungs,\\" Radar said. Dr. Elwin Crawford with Med Center Hoover says what people don't know about Cinnamon is not very biodegradable and too much of it can literally dry in your mouth. \\"Once that happens you are more prone to vomit. Once you vomit then can actually go back down into the lungs,\\" Crawford explained. And that, Crawford says, can lead to a cascade of events like pneumonia, collapse lungs, and even death. \\"Absolutely! If you go into respiratory distress, it can cause you to stop breathing, causes pneumonia, etc. So yes absolutely it can be fatal.\\" The Cinnamon Challenge is where people video tape themselves attempting to swallow a tablespoon of cinnamon without any water. \\"They have no idea the dangers of this. So I would urge everyone to pass the word that it is very dangerous,\\" Crawford said. It's why Rader is coming forward, just days after her son's death. \\"To let people know cinnamon can kill.

Tommy was so curious about what it would be like to have a car, something only very few people in the village owned. One day, Tommy's parents surprised him with a shiny, blue toy car. Tommy was so excited that he played with the car all day long, pretending to drive it up and down the hills, and even through the forest. This made Tommy dream even more about having a real car when he grew up. Many years passed, and Tommy finally became an adult. He got a job in the city and saved up his money to buy a real car, just like he had always dreamed. When he had enough money, he bought a blue car that looked just like his toy car! Tommy was so happy to finally have his dream car. He would drive it everywhere he went, not just in the village, but also to the city, the beach, and even on long road trips. Tommy's car wasn't just a way to get around; it was also his best friend. Tommy and his car went on many adventures together. They drove up and down the steepest hills, through the thickest forests, and even across the scariest bridges. Tommy was so proud of his car and how far they had come together. And so, Tommy and his blue car became famous in the village, and everyone knew about their amazing adventures. As time went by, Tommy realized that his car had brought him so much joy. His car became a symbol of his childhood dreams and memories. Now, every time Tommy goes on an adventure or just drives to the store, he remembers his younger days and how much he wished for the car he has today.

He says that \\"when electricity flows to a light bulb , the light bulb will turn on\\" and \\"electrical energy is also energy\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What happens when energy flows into a light bulb?\\" can be derived from the hints provided by the teacher. When electricity flows to a light bulb, the light bulb will turn on, and electrical energy is also a form of energy. As electrical energy flows into a light bulb, it gets converted into different forms of energy, primarily light energy and thermal energy. This process occurs due to the electrical resistance provided by the filament in the light bulb. In a traditional incandescent light bulb, a thin, coiled tungsten filament is encased in the glass bulb. When an electric current passes through the filament, the electrons in the current collide with the atoms that make up the tungsten filament. These collisions cause the electrons to slow down momentarily, which in turn causes them to release the energy they were carrying in the form of light and heat. This is called the incandescence process. As the electrical energy transforms into light and heat energy within the filament, the bulb starts to glow, and we see the light emitted from it. At the same time, the heat generated from the filament dissipates into the surrounding environment. In incandescent bulbs, only about 10% of the energy consumed is transformed into light energy, while the remaining 90% is released as waste heat. This makes them relatively inefficient when compared to newer technologies such as LED and CFL bulbs, which convert a higher percentage of the electrical energy into light energy and produce less waste heat. Ultimately, when energy flows into a light bulb, it leads to the conversion of electrical energy into light energy and thermal energy, illuminating the bulb and producing light as a result. This process is essential for everyday tasks, including reading, working, and navigating spaces in the absence of natural light."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: We know that sugary sodas aren't good for our bodies. Now it turns out that they may not be good for our minds, either. A new study of more than 260,000 people has found a link between sweetened soft-drinks and depression, and diet sodas may be making matters worse. Americans drink far more sodas than people in other countries-- as much as 170 liters per person per year. But the impact of this study isn't limited to the United States. \\"Sweetened drinks, coffee and tea are commonly consumed worldwide and have important physical consequences. And they may have important mental-health consequences as well,\\" study author Dr Honglei Chen said in a statement. The study studied 263,925 people between the ages of 50 and 71. Researchers followed their consumption of drinks like soda, tea coffee, and other soft drinks from 1995 to 1996 and then. 10 years later, asked them if they had been diagnosed with depression since the year 2000. More than 11,3000 of them had. Participants who drank more than four servings of sodas per day were 30 percent more likely to develop depression than participants who did not drink sodas at all. People who stuck with fruit punch , had a 38 percent higher risk than people who didn't drink sweetened drinks. And all that extra sugar isn't the actual problem. Researchers say that the artificial sweetener _ may be to blame. The study found a link but could not surely determine whether sodas and other sweet soft drinks cause depression. Still, the results \\"are consistent with a small but growing body of evidence suggesting that artificially sweetened beverages may be linked to poor health outcomes.\\" But there's a bright side for those who can't live without their daily sodas. Adults who drank coffee had a 10 percent lower risk of depression compared to people who didn't drink any coffee, according to the study. \\"Our research suggests that cutting out or down on sweetened diet drinks or replacing them with unsweetened coffee may naturally help lower your depression risk,\\" said Chen.","completion":"Which of the following is true according to the provided article? a) Consuming a high amount of sugary sodas has no effect on mental health. b) Drinking more than four servings of sodas per day is linked to a 30% higher chance of developing depression. c) Coffee intake increases the risk of depression. d) The study conclusively proves that sodas and sweet soft drinks cause depression.

The parish covers a vast land.","completion":"Given the preceding text, the next sentence does not entirely follow. The sentence \\"The parish covers a vast land.\\" could be considered somewhat ambiguous and potentially misleading, as the term \\"vast\\" is subjective and can vary according to individual interpretations. The key is to provide more specific information already mentioned in the description. In the provided text, it is mentioned that Fulletby parish covers approximately 1,950 acres (7.89 square kilometers). While this might not be considered \\"vast\\" when compared to significantly larger parishes or counties, it could be seen as sizable in proportion to the small population described. The word \\"vast\\" may not be the best term to use in this context, as it might lead to a misunderstanding of the actual area size. Instead, the sentence could be rephrased to more accurately reflect the details provided in the preceding text. One possible option is: The parish, with an area of approximately 1,950 acres, is relatively spacious considering its small population of less than 100 residents. In this alternative sentence, the actual size of the area is provided, and the connection to the small population is emphasized. Additionally, the term \\"relatively spacious\\" is used to create a more accurate description of the land size, avoiding the potentially misleading connotations of \\"vast.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Given the background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. and the situation: Year 2022 would be an interesting year when three comets would get scientists' attention - Comet A, Comet B, and Comet C. Comet A and C are very faint, but Comet B is very bright. Comet A would enter the inner solar system on February 10, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 20, 2022. Comet B would enter the inner solar system on February 18, 2022 and leave the inner solar system on February 26, 2022. Comet C would never enter the inner solar system. Answer the following question: Which comet's dust would reflect sunlight, Comet B or Comet C? The answer is:","completion":"Comet B's dust would reflect sunlight. This is because Comet B is a bright comet that enters the inner solar system between February 18, 2022, and February 26, 2022. As it approaches the inner solar system, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. This dust then reflects sunlight, which is why Comet B appears bright. In contrast, Comet C never enters the inner solar system, so its dust does not have the opportunity to reflect sunlight in the same way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The story begins with Beatrix Potter nervously packing her portfolio and narrating that she is a London spinster, and that her ambition to become a children's author meets with wide disapproval. She and her chaperone, Miss Wiggin, visit the publishing house of Harold and Fruing Warne, who decide to publish her book. Beatrix is thrilled and returns home, taking a drive through the parks to celebrate first. However, it is revealed the Warne brothers think her book is ridiculous and will no doubt be a failure.

Which island had fewer birds with smaller beaks die in the drought? Two bird islands experienced different levels of rainfall. West island experienced a lengthy drought that lasted several years. Many birds were affected by this drought. East island had several normal years as far as rainfall was concerned. Hint: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced. Within just a couple of years, the average beak size in the finches increased. This was clearly evolution by natural selection. Answer:","completion":"East island had fewer birds with smaller beaks die in the drought. The paragraph states that West island experienced a lengthy drought that lasted several years, whereas East island had several normal years concerning rainfall. As the drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat, birds with smaller beaks could only eat smaller seeds and were more affected by the scarcity of food. Birds with bigger beaks had a wider variety of seeds they could eat, so they had more food available during the drought. This led to many small-beaked birds dying in West island, where the drought was most severe. On the contrary, East island had relatively normal rainfall and thus a better seed availability for the birds, which means birds with smaller beaks faced fewer challenges on this island. Consequently, fewer birds with smaller beaks died in East island during this period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: On March 28th, the New York Times will begin charging all but the most infrequent users to read articles online. In a letter to readers, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., the publisher of the paper, laid out the details of the paywall, which he said will go into effect immediately in Canada and on March 28th for the rest of the world. He called the move \\"an important step that we hope you will see as an investment in the Times, one that will strengthen our ability to provide high-quality journalism to readers around the world and on any platform.\\" Sulzberger said that readers will be able to read 20 articles per month at no charge. Once they click on the 21st piece, however, they'll be presented with three payment options: 15 for four weeks of online and mobile application access, 20 for access to the site and the iPad application, or 35 for access to everything. People who already receive the printed paper through home delivery will enjoy free and unlimited access to the Times on all platforms. These details largely agree with earlier reports on how the paywall would work. The Times had made it clear that it did not want to imitate the total paywalls put into effect by papers such as The Times of London and Newsday, which block access to all contents unless the reader pays. The paper also signaled that it wants to stay relevant in the social media world. According to Sulzberger's announcement, people who come to the Times site from Facebook, Twitter or from blogs will be able to read those articles even if they have gone over their monthly limit.

Please answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Paragraph : If the gas is cooled, the particles will move more slowly, because they will have less energy. Question: When we get warm we become faster or slower? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it explains the behavior of gas particles when they are in different temperature conditions. According to the paragraph, when a gas is cooled, its particles will move more slowly because they have less energy. Now, to address the question about humans becoming faster or slower when warm, it is essential to understand that human body has a different response mechanism to temperature changes compared to gas particles. When we get warm, our body undergoes a series of physiological processes to maintain an optimal internal temperature (homeostasis). One of the primary responses to increase in body temperature is the activation of our body's cooling mechanisms, such as sweating and increasing blood flow towards the skin surface, which helps in dissipating the excess heat. These responses are regulated by our nervous system, which generally operates more efficiently at higher temperatures within a certain range (typically around 98.6°F or 37°C in healthy adults). So, when we get warm (within reason), our metabolism increases, and the efficiency of our nervous system can improve as well, leading to enhanced body functions such as muscle contraction, reaction times, and overall performance. This means that in a warmer state within a specific range, our body can become slightly faster in terms of some physical and mental tasks. However, this statement comes with a caveat. If the body becomes too warm (e.g. during a heat stroke or extremely high fever), it can cause severe stress and even damage to our cells and organs, which can impair our physical and cognitive functions, making us slower and less effective. In summary, when we get warm within a reasonable range, our body tends to become faster due to improved metabolic and neurological functions. However, if we get too warm, it can lead to negative consequences that may slow us down and impair our overall performance. It's important to note that this response is in contrast to the behavior of gas particles, which move more slowly when cooled."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Following a debut on the BBC's Top of the Pops on 5 January 1984 while at number 35, the single rose to number six the following week. On 11 January 1984, BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Mike Read was playing the record on his show when he noticed the front cover design (by Yvonne Gilbert). Read apparently became outraged by the \\"overtly sexual\\" nature of both the record sleeve and the printed lyrics, which prompted him to remove the disc from the turntable live on air, branding it \\"obscene\\". Two days later - almost three months after the single's initial release, and just eight days after the group's Top of the Pops appearance - the BBC banned the record from all its TV and radio outlets, with the exception of its Top 40 show. \\"Relax\\" immediately shot to Number One in the UK charts and stayed there for five weeks, during which time the BBC could not feature the nation's best-selling single on Top of the Pops. The original video was directed by Bernard Rose and depicted a gay S&M parlour where the band members were admired by muscular leathermen, a bleached blonde drag queen, and a large-bodied man dressed as a Roman emperor. The video featured a scene where one of the band members wrestled a live tiger, to the admiration of the clubgoers, and ended where the \\"emperor\\" was so excited he shimmied out of his toga. Filmed in the unused East London theatre Wilton's Music Hall, it was promptly banned by both the BBC and MTV, resulting in the production of a substitute video directed by filmmaker Brian De Palma to coincide with the release of his film Body Double. The BBC lifted its ban on \\"Relax\\" at the end of 1984 to allow the band to perform it on the Christmas edition of Top of the Pops (it had been, aside from Band Aid of which Holly Johnson was a participant, the biggest-selling single of the year).

Q: Those with low levels of identity diffusion are classified as what? A: Weinreich's identity variant similarly includes the categories of identity diffusion, foreclosure and crisis, but with a somewhat different emphasis. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"To accurately answer the question, I'll need to research and obtain information about identity diffusion and Weinreich's categories to identify the correct classification for those with low levels of identity diffusion. Step 1: Research on identity diffusion Identity diffusion is a state of an individual's development when they haven't committed to a specific self-identity, values, or goals and, therefore, face difficulty making decisions for their future. It's one of the stages in the process of identity development as proposed by James Marcia and is based on Erikson's psychosocial theory. Step 2: Research on Weinreich's identity variant Weinreich expanded on the concept of identity by incorporating ideas from social and developmental psychology and proposed the Identity Structure Analysis (ISA) method. His categories of identity include identity diffusion, foreclosure, and crisis. Step 3: Analyzing the categories of identity diffusion, foreclosure, and crisis in Weinreich's variant - Identity Diffusion: A state in which an individual lacks commitment and exploration of their self-concept or goals. - Identity Foreclosure: A state in which an individual has made a commitment without exploring alternatives, often following parental or societal expectations. - Identity Crisis: A state in which an individual undergoes exploration and questioning about their self-concept, values, or beliefs. Step 4: Identifying the correct classification for those with low levels of identity diffusion Based on the information gathered, low levels of identity diffusion would imply that an individual has a more definite sense of self and has likely committed to specific values or goals. Given the categories of identity in Weinreich's variant, individuals with low levels of identity diffusion would not fit the descriptions of identity diffusion or identity crisis. Instead, they would be more closely aligned with identity foreclosure, where the individual has made a commitment without exploring alternatives, although it should be noted that this comparison is not entirely accurate, as foreclosure also has its own specific implications. In conclusion, although not an exact match, those with low levels of identity diffusion could be more closely classified as experiencing identity foreclosure in Weinreich's variant of identity development. However, it is important to consider that low levels of identity diffusion may not correspond perfectly with any of Weinreich's categories, as each category has its own unique characteristics."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Birthdays often involve surprises. But this year's surprise on the birthday of the great British playwright William Shakespeare is surely one of the most dramatic. On April 22, one day before his 441st birthday anniversary, experts discovered that one of the most recognizable portraits of William Shakespeare is a fake. This means that we no longer have a good idea of what Shakespeare looked like. \\"It's very possible that many pictures of Shakespeare might be unreliable because many of them are copies of this one,\\" said an expert from Britain's National Portrait Gallery. The discovery comes after four months of testing using X-rays, ultraviolet light, microphotography and paint samples. The experts from the gallery say the image --commonly known as the \\"Flower portrait\\"-- was actually painted in the 1800s, about two centuries after Shakespeare's death. The art experts who work at the gallery say they also used modern chemistry technology to check the paint on the picture. These checks found traces of paint dating from about 1814. Shakespeare died in 1616, and the date that appears on the portrait is 1609. \\"We now think the portrait dates back to around 1818 to 1840. This was when there was a renewed interest in Shakespeare's plays,\\" Tarnya Cooper, the gallery's curator , told the Associated President. The fake picture has often been used as a cover for collections of his plays. It is called the Flower portrait because one of its owners, Desmond Flower, gave it to the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"There have always been questions about the painting,\\" said David Howells, curator for the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"Now we know the truth, we can put the image in its proper place in the history of Shakespearean portraiture.\\" Two other images of Shakespeare, are also being studied as part of the investigation and the results will come out later this month. _ Question: Which statement is True according to the passage?

Question: Process: - Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth&#x27;s crust - Magma rises - Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano - Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill - Gain energy for eruption - Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes) - If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases - Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense - If the magma is thin and runs - The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption - Question: suppose the magma rises less happens, how will it affect more magma fills the chambers. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"If the magma rises less, it will directly affect the rate at which magma fills the chambers, resulting in less magma being collected inside the magma chambers underneath a volcano. This will lead to several potential consequences: 1. Reduced pressure build-up: With less magma filling the chambers, the rate of pressure build-up will be slower. As pressure is one of the driving forces behind volcanic eruptions, this may cause the volcano to have fewer eruptions or less frequent explosive eruptions. 2. Smaller or less frequent earthquakes: As magma rises and collects in the chambers, some of the energy is converted into seismic activity, causing earthquakes. With less magma rising, there would likely be a decrease in the number, intensity, or frequency of earthquakes associated with the volcano. 3. Less explosive eruptions: If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky, it can trap gases, resulting in explosive eruptions when the pressure becomes too intense. With less magma rising and filling the chambers, there may be a decrease in the intensity of explosive eruptions, as there is less buildup of gas and pressure. 4. More low-pressure, slow-moving lava flows: If the magma that rises is thin and runs, it can result in low-pressure, slow-moving lava flows instead of violent eruptions. As there would be less magma rising in this scenario, the likelihood of low-pressure, slow-moving lava flows could become more common, leading to smaller scale eruptions that are less dangerous to humans and the environment. To summarize, if the magma rises less, it will generally lead to less magma filling the chambers (option B). This can result in several consequences, including reduced pressure, fewer or less intense earthquakes, less explosive eruptions, and a higher likelihood of low-pressure, slow-moving lava flows.

UPDATE, 7:09 AM: Just more than two weeks before his criminal trial for an alleged 2004 rape is set to start in Pennsylvania, Bill Cosby told a radio host today he will not testify on his own behalf. After being teased out yesterday by SiriusXM, the admission came on Michael Smerconish’s show in a pre-taped 30-minute interview with the much accused comedian. Ahead of the June 5 trial start date in Norristown, PA, the segment with Cosby airs in the 10 AM ET hour, aka right now. While he will not take the stand, Cosby is expected to be in Judge Steven O’Neill’s courtroom every day of the expected two-week trial, as required by the laws of the Keystone State. If found guilty of three felony charges of second-degree aggravated indecent assault against then-Temple University employee Andrea Constand, the 79-year-old and supposedly blind Cosby could be sentenced to up to 10 years in jail. In the past several years, nearly 60 other women have gone public with accusations of being assaulted and drugged by The Cosby Show star. Jury selection in the trial is scheduled to start next week; Cosby will likely be in the courtroom for that too. PREVIOUS, MAY 15 PM: A week before jury selection is set to start in Bill Cosby’s criminal trial for the alleged 2004 rape of then-Temple University employee Andrea Constand, the comedian has taken to the airwaves to tell his side of the story — sort of. “The piling on, so to speak, is a way, and certainly an impressive, impressive way, to get public opinion to come to the other side,” Cosby tells Michael Smerconish on his SiriusXM radio show about the nearly 60 women who have claimed the comedian assaulted or drugged them over the decades for unwanted sex. The statement comes from excerpts released ahead of a full 30-minute interview to air tomorrow between Cosby and Smerconish, also a CNN host. The interview was conducted earlier today over the phone. The Cosby interview came after his daughter Esna Cosby appeared on iHeartRadio’s The Breakfast Club show Monday morning, saying in part that “racism has played a big role in all aspects of this scandal.” Smerconish asked Cosby whether he agreed. “Could be,” he responded. “Could be …there are so many tentacles. So many different – ‘nefarious’ is a great word. And I just truly believe that some of it may very well be that.” In a move almost as rare as the interview itself, Cosby also took to social media Monday to promote his daughters Ensa and Erinn coming to his defense, playing the family man angle he was once so well known for: I love you Camille, Erika, Erinn, Ensa & Evin – keep fighting in Spirit Ennis — Bill Cosby (@BillCosby) May 15, 2017 With statements by another of his other daughters and an email interview with Black Press USA last month, this latest public move by Cosby comes just over two weeks before the only criminal case against him goes to trial in Norristown, PA. If found guilty, the 79-year-old actor could be sent behind bars for up to a decade. A source close to the situation tells me Cosby plans several more such media appearances in the next few weeks, choosing venues where he can control to varying degrees the questions and the probing. Family members and surrogates are also expected to step forward for the actor, who will be in court daily once the June 5-set trial starts. Teasing that Cosby will reveal whether he will take the stand or not in his trial in the full interview to be aired Tuesday (wanna bet the answer is No?), Smerconish explained in a Facebook video Monday how the conversation came together. “I knew that there would be limitations on that which he would be able and willing to say pertaining to the upcoming trial,” he said after being approached by a Cosby rep with statements from the family and asking for an interview with the actor directly. “But I must say, I’m surprised by how much he did address.” In the most recent developments in the criminal case, where Cosby is charged with three felony charges of second-degree aggravated indecent assault against Constand, Judge Steven O’Neill late last month made clear what is and isn’t allowed at trial in what was likely his final pre-trial ruling. Both the defense and the Montgomery County D.A.’s office got a portion of what they wanted. Parts of the once-assumed sealed 2005 deposition by Cosby in the civil case Constand brought against the actor will be heard by the jury. Made public in 2015 and kicking off the flood of civil cases nationwide, the sworn testimony showed Cosby admitting he had used Quaaludes to have sex with women in the 1970s. Other parts of that deposition, plus the settled civil case itself, will not be heard by the jury, jore will a parts of a 1991 book by Cosby in which he discussed the supposed aphrodisiac Spanish Fly with Larry King. Despite dozens of women coming forth in the past two years with stories of being assaulted by The Cosby Show creator, the Pennsylvania case is the only criminal one against Cosby. He was charged by the newly elected D.A. in the closing days of 2015, just before Pennsylvania’s 12-year statute of limitations on sex crimes in his case expired. He was arraigned December 30 and released on 1 million bail without entering a plea. In subsequent months, Cosby and various lawyers have attempted numerous methods and jurisdictions to get the case dismissed. ||||| As Bill Cosby prepares for his sexual assault trial next month, the entertainer posted a tweet Monday expressing love for his family and seemingly urging his slain son Ennis, who has been dead for 20 years, to “keep fighting.” “I love you Camille, Erika, Erin, Ensa & Evin — keep fighting in Spirit Ennis,” reads the post. Ennis Cosby, 27, was fatally shot in January 1997 during an attempted carjacking after he pulled onto the roadside of Interstate 405 in Los Angeles to change a flat tire. The killer, Michael Markhasev, was convicted and sentenced to life without parole. I love you Camille, Erika, Erinn, Ensa & Evin – keep fighting in Spirit Ennis — Bill Cosby (@BillCosby) May 15, 2017 In April, Cosby’s youngest daughter, Evin, 40, defended her father in an online essay, writing that he “loves and respects women.” Evin Cosby added, “He is not abusive, violent or a rapist. Sure, like many celebrities tempted by opportunity, he had his affairs, but that was between him and my mother. They have worked through it and moved on, and I am glad they did for them and for our family.” Cosby, 79, has pleaded not guilty to three counts of aggravated indecent assault for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand at his Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, mansion in January 2004. Jury selection begins May 22, with the trial scheduled to start June 5. The entertainer, through his attorneys, repeatedly has denied the allegations related to Constand and similar claims from more than 50 other women.

In an interview posted April 26 with the NNPA Newswire, which posted his daughter’s essay the same day, Cosby said he is now completely blind after waking about two years ago and telling wife Camille, “I can’t see.” Cosby gave up performing after he was charged in December 2015 with the alleged assault on Constand, now 44, a former Temple University employee. Daughter’s Essay Claimed ‘Public Persecution’ of Cosby In her essay, Evin Cosby referenced the loss of her brother. “I thought when my brother Ennis was murdered, that was the worst nightmare of all time,” she wrote. “It’s so hurtful to this day. I try to block out the day he was killed, but that pain has only worsened in these last few years. For some reason, my family’s pain has been a trigger for people to seize upon us harder.” Although Bill Cosby did not discuss the sexual assault case against him in his published interview, Evin addressed the topic head-on. “The public persecution of my dad, my kids’ grandfather, and the cruelty of the media and those who speak out branding my father a ‘rapist’ without ever knowing the truth and who shame our family and our friends for defending my dad makes all of this so much worse for my family and my children.” she wrote. Ennis Cosby George School, Mark Osterman/AP “Two years ago, and over 10 years later, several women came out,” she wrote. “Like the woman from 2005, they claimed to have been raped or drugged. But, like the one from 2005, their stories didn’t match up. Instead of going through the criminal justice system, these stories never got investigated and just got repeated. They have been accepted as the truth. My dad tried to defend himself. His lawyers tried to defend him, but they all got sued.” “People were constantly reaching out to me about why doesn’t you dad say something,” she wrote. “I kept saying he’s trying, but the media is only interested in the stories of the women. Friends of our tried to help, but the media wouldn’t print what they said or knew.” Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Constand in 2006. But in a decade-old deposition, Cosby said he acquired seven prescriptions for quaaludes in the 1970s with the intent of giving them to women he was pursuing for sex. He said he no longer had the prescriptions when the alleged incident with Constand occurred. After a judge ruled April 28 that jurors in the current case will be allowed to hear testimony about Cosby’s intentions with quaaludes, both his spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, and the prosecutor in the case, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele, declined comment. ||||| Bill Cosby says it \\"could be\\" racism is playing a part in the backlash of the sexual assault allegations against him.

I remember our family trips and moving to NYC just so we could be closer to my father as he worked. From the time he worked in Las Vegas to the Cosby show in NYC, he always wanted us to be close, to be a part of his whole life, at home and on stage. I felt loved and remembered loving the moments that my parents shared with us by exposing us to all types of people from all walks of life. We grew up appreciating my father’s success because we knew the prejudice and racism he endured getting to where he got and how hard he worked for our family. Because I loved my childhood, I couldn’t wait to have a family of my own. I have two amazing children who love their grandfather. I already work hard as a single mother, with no full-time help, and with a career in fashion design, I am lucky that I have supportive friends that I call family because my children and I need that support. The public persecution of my dad, my kids’ grandfather, and the cruelty of the media and those who speak out branding my father a “rapist” without ever knowing the truth and who shame our family and our friends for defending my dad, makes all of this so much worse for my family and my children. When people are so quick to cast hate, and make accusations of horrific violence against my dad, they are callous in their carelessness about the harm they are causing to others. I thought when my brother Ennis was murdered, that was the worst nightmare of all time. It’s so hurtful to this day. I try to block out the day he was killed, but that pain has only worsened in these last years. For some reason, my family’s pain has been a trigger for people to seize upon us harder. On the same day that Ennis was murdered, a woman came out claiming that my father had a “love child.” She was arrested for extortion. She was not my father’s daughter. On the day I gave birth to my son, another women came out, but that case was dismissed too – the district attorney investigated her claims also and didn’t press charges. Two years ago, and over 10 years later, several women came out. Like the woman from 2005, they claimed to have been raped and drugged. But, like the one from 2005, their stories didn’t match up. Instead of going through the criminal justice system, these stories never got investigated and just got repeated. They have been accepted as the truth. My dad tried to defend himself. His lawyers tried to defend him, but they all got sued. People were constantly reaching out to me about why doesn’t your dad say something. I kept saying he’s trying, but the media is only interested in the stories of the women. Friends of ours tried to help, but the media wouldn’t print what they said or knew. Our friends that spoke up were pressured to shut up. No one wanted to print their supportive words. We live in a scandalous country where the more sexualized and provocative the story, the more attention it gets. We get all sorts of mixed up messages in our society. We are told that we have fundamental rights to be innocent until proven guilty. But, if enough people think you are a bad person, you are branded a bad person and the media just reinforces that. My dad, like anyone in this country, deserves to be treated fairly under the law. My dad broke barriers and raised the conscious of America on important topics, especially for the advancement of women. On “The Cosby Show” he only depicted women as smart and accomplished. On “The Cosby Show” and on “A Different World,” he took on then taboo subjects like menstrual cycles and rape, and even did a show on AIDS before anyone else would bring it up. I am his fourth daughter. He raised me to go to college, start my own business, and be my own woman. He is helping me raise my children and teach them family values. I know that my father loves me, loves my sisters and my mother. He loves and respects women. He is not abusive, violent or a rapist. Sure, like many celebrities tempted by opportunity, he had his affairs, but that was between him and my mother. They have worked through it and moved on, and I am glad they did for them and for our family. The harsh and hurtful accusations of things that supposedly happened 40 or 50 years ago, before I was born, in another lifetime, and that have been carelessly repeated as truth without allowing my dad to defend himself and without requiring proof, has punished not just my dad but every one of us. They have punished the talented people who were still earning money and feeding their families from my dad’s shows and work. I am pleased that finally we are seeing the whole picture and seeing cases and claims dismissed from court. I just hope that those who pre-judged my dad are now willing to admit that they were wrong. ||||| In his first public interview in more than two years, Bill Cosby said that racism might be partly responsible for the allegations of sexual assault against him, and that his accusers are “piling on” charges to court public opinion. Speaking to SiriusXM host Michael Smerconish for a segment airing Tuesday, Cosby was asked about his daughter Ensa Cosby’s recent assertion that “racism has played a big role in all aspects of this scandal.” “Could be, could be,” Cosby said. “I can’t say anything, but there are certain things that I look at, and I apply to the situation, and there are so many tentacles. So many different — nefarious is a great word. And I just truly believe that some of it may very well be that.” When Smerconish noted that Cosby’s accusers are both black and white, the comedian replied, “Let me put it to you this way: When you look at the power structure, and when you look at individuals, there are some people who can very well be motivated by whether or not they’re going to work. Or whether or not they might be able to get back at someone. So if it’s in terms of whatever the choice is, I think that you can also examine individuals and situations and they will come out differently. So it’s not all, not every, but I do think that there’s some.” [soundcloud url=\\"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/322787564\\" params=\\"color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"166\\" iframe=\\"true\\" /] Cosby, 79, is scheduled to go to trial next month on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting former Temple University employee Andrea Constand at his Pennsylvania mansion in January 2004. He has pleaded not guilty and denies similar claims from more than 50 other women. Cosby’s lawyers have previously asserted that he “is no stranger to discrimination and racial hatred.” Elsewhere in his interview with Smerconish, Cosby was asked whether the sheer number of women accusing him of misconduct lends credence to their charges. “I think that the numbers came because the numbers prior to the numbers didn’t work,” Cosby said. “So the piling on, so to speak, is a way — and certainly an impressive, impressive way — to get public opinion to come to the other side.” [soundcloud url=\\"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/322787572\\" params=\\"color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false\\" width=\\"100%\\" height=\\"166\\" iframe=\\"true\\" /] Cosby’s full interview with Smerconish will air Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET on SiriusXM’s channel 124. ||||| Bill Cosby, shown leaving a courthouse in April in Pennsylvania, is on a PR blitz leading up to his trial. (Matt Rourke/AP) In a rare interview airing Tuesday, Bill Cosby said he does not expect to testify at his upcoming felony sexual assault trial and that he believes racism played a big role in the scandal that has engulfed his life. During a 30-minute conversation with SiriusXM host Michael Smerconish, the 79-year-old entertainer portrays himself as a victim of the media and of accusers who were “piling on.” Cosby, who has been accused of sexual misdeeds by at least 60 women, cited a feminist author, saying “Gloria Steinem had a very interesting quote. She said, ‘The truth shall set you free, but first it might piss you off.’ ” Cosby’s interview is part of a rollout of orchestrated media appearances in advance of the start of jury selection Monday in his trial on charges of drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former Temple University women’s basketball official, in 2004 at his estate in suburban Philadelphia. One of Cosby’s attorneys, Angela Agrusa, who is based in Los Angeles, recently told the Hollywood Reporter that she hopes to change “the optics” of Cosby’s presumed guilt and hinted that she may use a theory of “false memory creation” to undercut his accuser’s credibility. Earlier this week, two of Cosby’s daughters — Ensa and Erinn — provided taped statements to “The Breakfast Club,” a nationally syndicated radio program about hip-hop music, culture and politics. “What my father and family have had to endure these last few years makes me ashamed of our country today,” Erinn said in her taped remarks. Her sister said: “I believe that racism has played a big role in all aspects of this scandal. . . . My father is being punished by a society that still believes black men rape white women, but passes off as ‘boys will be boys’ when white men are accused.” Cosby, in the days leading up to his sexual assault trial, is talking publicly about his home life with his wife, Camille. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP) Asked about the racism allegation, Bill Cosby said, “Could be. . . . I just truly believe that some of it may very well be that.” Cosby did not respond when asked to reconcile the racism claims with the fact that some of his accusers are black. Smerconish scored the big interview, Cosby’s first extended taped remarks since the scandal broke in late 2014, after he was first offered a 1½ -hour recording of Erinn Cosby interviewing her father for a documentary. Smerconish, an author and cable-television personality who lives in Montgomery County, Pa., where Cosby’s trial will be held, said he would only air portions of that interview if he were able to interview the comedy legend himself. [In a polarized media world Michael Smerconish, plays to the middle ] “I decided I think it’s time for me to do something so that the people who still have faith in me, the people who are still wondering what I sound like as opposed to the National Enquirer, which is very interesting reading when they write about me,” Cosby said, explaining his decision to agree to the interview. Reached by phone, Steinem said it was a “mystery” to her why Cosby would cite her. “It seems to me the women who are accusing him have more right to use that quote,” she said. “I have no idea what he was thinking.” Steinem said she finds Cosby’s accusers “credible — as individuals and in their numbers.” Erinn Cosby, right, shown her with her sister Evin Cosby and singer Dianne Reeves in 2005, has released a statement defending her father in advance of jury selection in his sexual assault trial. (Evan Agostini/Getty Images) Cosby and his daughters seem intent on humanizing him and drawing attention to his philanthropic work. In a clip from his interview with Erinn, Cosby recalled growing up poor in Philadelphia and making a football out of rolled-up newspapers and rubber bands. [The forgotten story of when Bill Cosby’s daughter accused Mike Tyson of rape] In his interview with Smerconish, Cosby talked about taking charge of arrangements for a special meal for his wife of more than 50 years, Camille, on Mother’s Day this year. “I pretended I was Michael Jordan,” he said, referencing the basketball superstar known for taking charge on the court. “She came down, and she read the note, and she smiled, and everything there was just perfectly done, and it’s exactly what she hasn’t had in a long time.” [Camille Cosby: A life spent juggling a role as a public figure with a desire for privacy] Cosby repeatedly referred to limits placed by his lawyers on what he can say. But when Smerconish pressed him about testifying at his trial, Cosby was somewhat more expansive. Asked if he wanted to testify, Cosby said, “No.” “Once again, I go back to my lawyers,” he said. “When you have to deal with examination, cross-examination, et cetera, et cetera — more than two sides to every story. Sometimes it’s four or five. . . . I just don’t want to sit there and have to figure out what I believe is a truthful answer as to whether or not I’m opening a can of something that my lawyers are scrambling.” At times during the interview, Cosby offered rambling or confusing responses. Early on, he said he’d “like to be remembered for being the guy that they made give back all the things they rescinded.” Asked to clarify his remark, Cosby said, “Well, things were rescinded, and I’d like to get those things back, because the people who decided to make that decision then saw they’d made a mistake.” But he was crystal clear about his desire to return to performing — no matter the outcome of his trial: “I still feel like I have an awful lot to offer in terms of my writing, in terms of my performance. . . . I want to get back to the laughter and enjoyment of things that I’ve written and things that I perform on stage.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Comedian Bill Cosby has said that racism \\"could be\\" a factor in the sexual assault allegations leveled against him by nearly 60 women in a rare interview with SiriusXM host Michael Smerconish.

Funerals are intended to provide comfort, closure, and an opportunity to pay respects and celebrate the life of the deceased. In many cultures, this is done through a ceremony and may involve an open or closed casket presentation. Let's briefly examine the other options: - Trunk: Finding a dead body in a trunk is a scenario often portrayed in crime movies or novels. It's worth mentioning that such occurrences are illegal and likely connected to criminal activities like homicide or kidnapping. - Basement: While this option might also be plausible, it's not a common or appropriate location for a body to be discovered. In some cases, though, it might be a crime scene or a temporary resting place during wake, which is a tradition in certain cultures. - Cemetery: While you may find graves with buried bodies, it's less common to encounter an exposed body in a cemetery. Cemeteries are spaces specifically designed for internment, often with tombstones or grave markers rather than visible bodies. - Closet: Similar to the trunk scenario, finding a body in a closet is usually not a normal situation and could be related to illicit activities, accidents, or tragic events.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: Gary Sheffields new enemy is his old team. The Yankees traded Sheffield to the Detroit Tigers for three minor league pitchers yesterday, assuring that they have now become the most hated team in Sheffields universe. Barton Silverman/The New York Times Garry Sheffield averaged 35 homers and 122 runs batted in for his first two seasons with the Yankees, but was limited to 39 games last season. Whatever cuddly feelings Sheffield had for the team he played for the past three years and where he had hoped to finish his career vanished when the Yankees traded him. Sheffield has said that he targets the teams that have unloaded him, which means that he will see bulls-eyes, not pinstripes. Despite Sheffields recent venom toward the Yankees, he seemed excited about joining the Tigers and reuniting with Jim Leyland, who managed him with the 1997 World Series champion Florida Marlins. Sheffield, who will earn 13 million in 2007, was also ecstatic about signing a two-year, 28 million contract extension. I know this is meant for a reason, Sheffield said. Sheffield already knew that the Tigers and the Yankees had agreed on the players for the trade Wednesday, when he criticized the Yankees and said he was a better player than Bobby Abreu, his replacement in right field. The agreement happened Tuesday. Detroit was then given 72 hours to speak with Sheffield about an extension, which was completed late Thursday night. Because Sheffield acts as his own agent, he said that he had to say things and do things that you might not really want to do. Sheffield, who did not have a no-trade clause, may have helped engineer a move to the type of team that he preferred by moving his mouth. He threatened to retire if the Yankees traded him somewhere he did not want to be. A lot of people might not agree with the way I go about it, Sheffield said. But if youre your own agent, you have to get it done by any means necessary. And I think I accomplished that. Rufus Williams, who is Sheffields representative, said: People might not understand the whats and whens and whys of Gary speaking out. But he speaks from the heart. Leyland called Sheffield one of the ultimate bats in baseball and one of the ultimate people in baseball. Sheffield, who turns 38 next week, has a .297 average and 455 home runs in his 19-year career. The Tigers, the reigning American League champions, praised Sheffield as a person almost as much as a hitter during a 30-minute conference call. Its almost unbelievable, Leyland said. Its hard for me to believe that we landed Gary Sheffield. Yankees Manager Joe Torre said he was surprised to learn Sheffield maligned Abreu because Sheffield had been a loyal teammate. Now Torre will see Sheffield in the middle of the lineup for the team that defeated the Yankees in the division series. Im happy it didnt drag out, Torre said. It looked like it was getting uncomfortable for both sides. Sheffield, who was personally signed by George Steinbrenner, the principal owner, averaged 35 home runs and 122 runs batted in during his first two years with the Yankees. He finished second in the voting for the A.L. Most Valuable Player award in 2004 and eighth in 2005. But Sheffield sustained a wrist injury in a collision at first base in May and was limited to 39 games. In Sheffields absence, the Yankees obtained Abreu from the Philadelphia Phillies in July, and Sheffields situation became much murkier. Sheffield returned to play first base in late September and in the playoffs, but it was not a smooth transition. The Yankees did not envision Sheffield as an everyday first baseman for next season. He will be a designated hitter with the Tigers. Earlier this week, the Yankees exercised Sheffields option for 2007, but they did it with the intention of trading him. General Manager Brian Cashman had serious talks with three teams and moved rapidly because he liked the package Detroit offered. In exchange for Sheffield, the Yankees acquired three right-handers: Humberto Sanchez, Kevin Whelan and Anthony Claggett. Cashman said the Yankees were real excited about the upside of the three pitchers, but also said they had to prove they were prospects, not suspects. Sanchez, 23, who was a combined 10-6 with a 2.53 earned run average at Class AAA Toledo and Class AA Erie, is the closest to being ready for the major leagues. He is 6 feet 6 inches and is from the Bronx. Whelan, 22, was 4-1 with a 2.67 E.R.A. and 27 saves at Class A Lakeland. Claggett, 22, was 7-2 with a 0.91 E.R.A. and 14 saves for Class A West Michigan. We gave up a lot, said Dave Dombrowski, the Tigers general manager. I winced. Leyland said that he scribbled new lineups around 1 a.m. yesterday and found a place for Sheffield in each one. Sheffield was the hitter many opposing pitchers feared more than anyone else with the Yankees. But Sheffields time in New York is over. He is a Tiger now. I dont have any regrets there, Sheffield said. I thank them more than anything for allowing me have this opportunity to go out the way I want to go out. Write a title for it.","completion":"Baseball Player Gary Sheffield Traded to Detroit Tigers, Says Goodbye to New York Yankees"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip came later than Saturday Night Live. Saturday Night Live (SNL) is a long-running American late-night television variety and sketch comedy show that premiered on October 11, 1975. It was created by Lorne Michaels and Dick Ebersol, who produced the show. SNL broadcasts live from NBC Studio 8H, located in the GE Building at the Rockefeller Center in New York City. The show has been a launching pad for countless actors, comedians, and musicians throughout its multi-decade existence and is a staple of American entertainment. It has received numerous awards and nominations and has become a cultural phenomenon throughout the years. Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, on the other hand, is an American television drama series that debuted on September 18, 2006. Created by Aaron Sorkin, the show aired on NBC and starred actors such as Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet, Bradley Whitford, and Sarah Paulson. Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip took a behind-the-scenes look at the cast and crew of a late-night sketch-comedy show, sharing many similarities with Saturday Night Live. However, the show only lasted for one season consisting of 22 episodes, with the final episode airing on June 28, 2007. Thus, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip came later than Saturday Night Live, premiering approximately 31 years after the debut of SNL. While SNL has enjoyed an extensive and successful run, Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip did not achieve the same level of longevity or cultural impact."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cynthia showed Sarah how to make the best witch costume for Halloween since Available options: [+] Cynthia knew she was hoping to win a prize with her costume.. [+] Sarah knew she was hoping to win a prize with her costume..","completion":"Cynthia knew she was hoping to win a prize with her costume. As an experienced costume designer and a long-time fan of Halloween, Cynthia had a knack for creating stunning, prize-winning outfits. Step 1: Research witch costume ideas Cynthia began by doing some research on witch costume ideas with Sarah. They browsed through various sources, such as Pinterest, Instagram, and Halloween forums, gathering inspiration for their design. Step 2: Sketch the costume Once they had a fair idea of the elements they wanted to incorporate, Cynthia showed Sarah how to sketch the costume. They combined traditional and modern styles, creating a unique look that included a layered tulle skirt, a fitted velvet top, and a beautifully embroidered shawl. Step 3: Gather materials Cynthia and Sarah then took a trip to the local fabric store to gather the materials needed for their costume. They selected fabrics in dark, rich colors and chose intricate embellishments such as lace, ribbons, and beads. Step 4: Assemble the costume Back at Cynthia's house, they started with the skirt. Cynthia taught Sarah how to cut the tulle layers and sew them together to create a full and dramatic effect. Next, they moved on to the velvet top, carefully measuring and cutting the fabric to achieve a tailored fit for Sarah. Step 5: Customization With the basic structure of the costume completed, Cynthia showed Sarah different stitching techniques to add the embroidered details on the shawl, paying close attention to the quality of each stitch. They also placed beads and ribbons strategically throughout the costume, giving it a magical, otherworldly touch. Step 6: Accessorize No witch costume would be complete without some themed accessories. Cynthia and Sarah created a pointed hat and decorated it with various charms and feathers. They also made a wand from a wooden dowel and painted it to look like an aged, twisted staff. Step 7: Makeup and hairstyling Finally, Cynthia helped Sarah with her makeup and hairstyling. They opted for a dark, smoky eye and deep red lips, along with a stylish, disheveled hairdo that completed the witchy aesthetic. Once everything was finished, Sarah looked in the mirror and gasped. The costume was better than she had ever imagined, and her excitement to show it off at the Halloween party was palpable. As they admired their handiwork, Cynthia couldn't help but feel proud of the stunning witch costume they had created together. And given the effort and attention to detail put into the design, it seemed highly probable that Sarah would indeed win a prize with her costume."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(a) He wanted to be successful: This is likely true since Austin trained really hard for the race, showing that he had a strong desire to succeed. However, this doesn't explain what Austin needs to do before completing the race. (b) Needed to enter the race: This step makes sense as it is a necessary requirement for Austin to participate and eventually complete the race. Before training or focusing on success, Austin has to register and enter the race. (c) Needed to do nothing: This option contradicts the information provided, as Austin clearly trained hard in order to complete the race successfully. Doing nothing would not help him achieve that goal.

Although it starts by conceding that the subject has about 3/4th the fun of its 2001 predecessor, which could be seen as a somewhat positive comment, the overall impression given is negative. This is due to the use of several negative terms and critiques that undermine and outweigh the initial positive sentiment. Firstly, the phrase describes the subject as \\"rushed\\", implying that it was hastily created without due care and attention. This suggests that the creators did not invest sufficient time and effort to produce a well-crafted and thought-out result. Secondly, the term \\"slapdash\\" further emphasizes the lack of thought and care put into the subject. \\"Slapdash\\" refers to something that was done carelessly, further supporting the notion that the creators did not fully commit to delivering a high-quality product. The statement also highlights that it is a \\"sequel-for-the-sake-of-a-sequel\\". This implies that the subject was created simply to capitalize on the success of the original 2001 version, rather than to genuinely innovate and bring something new and valuable to the table. This critique suggests that the sequel lacks purpose and originality. Lastly, the phrase compares the plot and ingenuity of the subject to its predecessor, stating that it has \\"less than half the plot and ingenuity\\". This suggests that the creators were not able to replicate or surpass the original's interesting and inventive storyline, resulting in a weaker and less engaging product. In conclusion, despite the initial hint of positivity by giving the subject credit for having some fun aspects, the overall tone of the phrase is negative. The numerous critiques and disapproval expressed throughout the sentence far outweigh any positive elements mentioned, leading to an unfavorable evaluation of the subject in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Who is \\"she\\"?","completion":"In the given context, \\"she\\" refers to Nadia. The sentence states that Sue visited Nadia for dinner because Nadia invited her. The use of the pronoun \\"she\\" in this sentence is referring to the person who extended the invitation, and given that the invitation was for dinner at Nadia's place, it makes sense that \\"she\\" represents Nadia. To further understand the situation described in the sentence, let's break down the actions and connections between the two individuals. Nadia made a gesture of hospitality by inviting Sue to join her for dinner. This suggests that Nadia values her relationship with Sue and perhaps wanted to strengthen their connection with a meal shared together. On Sue's end, by accepting the invitation and visiting Nadia for dinner, it indicates that she appreciates and respects the relationship with Nadia as well. These actions demonstrate how social bonding and communication can deepen relationships and depict the role of the host and the guest in a simple manner. Moreover, this also shows the importance of understanding and using pronouns correctly in language, as they play a key role in indicating the subject or object of a sentence. In this case, \\"she\\" was used to refer to Nadia, making it clear that Nadia was the one who invited Sue to dinner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is: \\"The Starry Night.\\" \\"The Starry Night\\" is a widely recognized and celebrated painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist artist Vincent van Gogh. Created in June of 1889, this iconic masterpiece is known for its swirling, luminous night sky and the quaint, peaceful village nestled below. \\"The Starry Night\\" is considered one of Van Gogh's most famous and influential works and is a symbol of his personal struggles, creative vision, and artistic genius. The painting was done while Van Gogh was a voluntary patient at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, following his famous ear mutilation incident and subsequent mental health crisis. The painting's composition evokes a dream-like quality, with the prominent use of intense blues and bright yellows. The swirling patterns in the sky represent wind and cosmic energy, while the grounded village offers a contrast to the vastness of the celestial above. The painting's signature element is the captivating spiral structure of its central, radiant star, which adds an almost hypnotic depth to the piece. Although Van Gogh was not commercially successful during his lifetime and struggled with mental health issues throughout, his work has left a profound impact on the world of art. His pioneering approach to color, technique, and emotion paved the way for generations of artists to come, and his paintings continue to captivate viewers over a century after his death. In conclusion, \\"The Starry Night\\" is a significant painting in the history of Western art, showcasing Vincent van Gogh's unique artistic vision and his strong emotional connection to the world around him. It serves as a testament to his extraordinary talent and his lasting impact on the art world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 there was no policeman in London at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago, London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people had to stay in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. There was no policewoman in London until 1920. Today, London police are quite well paid and only a few police officers still ride horses. Perhaps the London Police Force's greatest achievement is to meet changing conditions and provide excellent police service .

Fierce Light is about spiritual activists . - Traditionally, spirituality refers to a religious process of re-formation which \\"aims to recover the original shape of man,\\" oriented at \\"the image of God\\" as exemplified by the founders and sacred texts of the religions of the world. In modern times the emphasis is on subjective experience of a sacred dimension and the \\"deepest values and meanings by which people live,\\" often in a context separate from organized religious institutions. Modern spirituality typically includes a belief in a supernatural (beyond the known and observable) realm, personal growth, a quest for an ultimate/sacred meaning, religious experience, or an encounter with one's own \\"inner dimension.\\" - Velcrow Ripper (born October 20, 1963 in Gibsons, British Columbia) is a Canadian documentary filmmaker, writer, and public speaker, best known for his Genie Award-winning 2006 film \\"Scared Sacred\\" and his newest feature documentary, \\"Fierce Light: When Spirit Meets Action\\".

The input sentence in Arabic says, \\"If you fail to play cards, you should move the deck and summon it.\\" Step 2: Identify possible changes a. ورق اللعب (cards) can be replaced with مباراة الأوراق (card game) to provide more context. With this change, the sentence would be more focused on the game rather than the cards themselves. b. Change the verb فشلت (fail) to its synonym لم تنجح (not succeed) for slight variation. c. Replace the phrase تزيح سطح السفينة وتستدعيها (move the deck and summon it) with تغيير استراتيجيتك وإعادة تجميعها (change your strategy and reassemble it) to make the sentence more about changing the strategy during a card game. Step 3: Construct the new sentence with changes. إذا لم تنجح في مباراة الأوراق، عليك تغيير استراتيجيتك وإعادة تجميعها. (If you do not succeed in the card game, you should change your strategy and reassemble it.) This new sentence is semantically related and syntactically similar to the input sentence and has high commonsense plausibility since it makes sense that when a person doesn't succeed in a card game, they might want to change their strategy and rethink their approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He wiped beads of sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand, maintaining a precarious grip on the fork as he skillfully navigated between the sizzling, fatty strips, his eyes never leaving the stovetop. It was easy to see just how much Chip valued his morning routine, which included meticulously preparing his favorite meal, a crispy, savory plate of bacon and eggs, served alongside a steaming cup of freshly-brewed coffee, best enjoyed while indulging in the daily news. To him, this was more than just about filling his stomach; it was an act of self-care, a time to savor the fleeting moments of peace and quiet before the day's unforgiving chaos kicked in. As the room filled with the familiar, comforting aroma of frying bacon, Chip couldn't help but reflect on the countless mornings he had spent honing his breakfast-preparation skills, the result of years of practice and dedication. At first, it had been nothing more than a means to an end - simply providing nourishment to start his day. But over time, he had grown to appreciate the subtle nuances of flavors and techniques, not to mention the rewarding feeling of biting into a perfectly cooked piece of bacon, a small, yet satisfying testament to his culinary expertise. Turning his attention back to the task at hand, Chip realized that the challenging spatula incident had, in fact, proved to be a valuable lesson in adaptability and resilience. The bacon had reached the desired level of crispiness, and he was now capable of handling unanticipated obstacles that came his way, a skill he knew would serve him well both in and out of the kitchen. It was a small victory, but one that reminded him that the most important ingredient in any recipe was perseverance, and that sometimes, the best dishes were the result of overcoming unexpected challenges. With renewed confidence, Chip plated up his delectable creation and eagerly sat down at the table, the weight of the fork feeling reassuringly solid in his hand as he prepared to indulge in the fruits of his labor. As he took the first bite, he savored the delightful crunch and smoky taste, letting the flavors linger on his tongue before swallowing with an air of satisfaction. The sun, now filtering in through the window, bathed the kitchen in a warm, golden glow, and Chip couldn't help but smile as he reveled in the thought of mastering yet another perfectly prepared breakfast, the ultimate reward for weathering the occasional spatula-related storm."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? even a must-see","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"even a must-see\\" is neutral with a slight positive connotation. To determine the sentiment of this phrase, we must break it down into its individual words and take into consideration the context in which it is used. The word \\"even\\" suggests that there is a level of comparison or contrast at play. It is typically used to provide a piece of information that may be surprising or unexpected, given some prior knowledge or assumption. On the other hand, the term \\"must-see\\" refers to something that is highly recommended or considered by many as essential to witness or experience. This term generally carries a positive connotation, as it suggests that the subject is noteworthy, appealing or attractive, and therefore worth the time or effort to see or do. In isolation, the phrase seems to convey a sense of interest and importance, and as such, could have a positive connotation. However, the specific sentiment of the phrase would largely depend on the context in which it appears. Here are a few examples to illustrate this: 1. Positive context: In a movie review, \\"The cinematography and performances in this film are outstanding, making it even a must-see for casual viewers.\\" In this example, the phrase is used to emphasize that the film is highly praised and therefore carries a positive sentiment. 2. Negative context: \\"Although the first half of the show was a bit slow, the highly-anticipated second half was, disappointingly, even a must-see.\\" In this case, the use of \\"even a must-see\\" highlights an expectation that wasn't met, resulting in a negative sentiment. 3. Neutral context: \\"With a range of activities to suit everyone's interests, the festival's program includes performances, workshops, and even a must-see attraction.\\" Here, \\"even a must-see\\" is simply used to describe an additional feature of the festival's program, and in this case, the sentiment is neutral. In conclusion, the sentiment of the phrase \\"even a must-see\\" can be considered neutral with a slight positive connotation due to the term \\"must-see\\". However, to precisely determine the sentiment, we must consider the context in which it is used, as shown in the examples above."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is ghee good for health? Is Ghee healthy for you? Do those questions have the same meaning? Pick your answer from: A). no; B). yes;","completion":"B). Yes Both questions, \\"Is ghee good for health?\\" and \\"Is Ghee healthy for you?\\", have the same meaning as they are inquiring about the health benefits or drawbacks of ghee. While the wording is slightly different, the core subject and intent remain the same. Ghee, which is clarified butter, is widely used in Indian cuisine and can also be found in various other cultural dishes. It is made by simmering butter to remove milk solids and water, leaving behind a rich, golden liquid. This process also gives ghee a higher smoke point than regular butter, making it a popular choice for cooking. In terms of health, ghee has a complex profile, with both benefits and potential drawbacks. Health Benefits of Ghee: 1. Contains healthy fats: Ghee is primarily composed of saturated fats, which were once considered unhealthy. However, recent research has shown that not all saturated fats are equal, and some can even be beneficial when consumed in moderation. Ghee contains medium-chain triglycerides, which can provide energy and help burn fat. 2. Rich in vitamins and minerals: Ghee is a good source of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. These vitamins help maintain healthy vision, support immune function, and strengthen bones and teeth. Additionally, ghee contains traces of minerals like calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. 3. Aids digestion: Ghee contains butyric acid, a short-chain fatty acid that helps maintain gut health. Butyric acid can promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria and help reduce inflammation, which is critical for those suffering from digestive disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. 4. Lactose-free: As ghee is made by removing milk solids from butter, it is essentially lactose-free. This makes it a suitable choice for individuals with lactose intolerance or those trying to minimize their lactose consumption. Potential Drawbacks of Ghee: 1. High in calories: Ghee is calorie-dense, containing about 120 calories per tablespoon. It's essential to consume it in moderation, as excessive intake can lead to weight gain and other associated health issues. 2. Cholesterol: Ghee contains cholesterol, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease in some people. However, research on this is mixed and depends on individual genetics and overall diet. 3. Not suitable for everyone: While ghee may have various health benefits, it may not be the best choice for everyone. People with certain medical conditions or dietary preferences might need to opt for different cooking oils or fat sources. In conclusion, while ghee has some health benefits, it's vital to consume it in moderation and as part of a balanced diet. It's good to remember that individual nutritional needs and health requirements vary, so it's essential to consider your specific circumstances when deciding whether ghee is suitable for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are more pressure or less pressure ): During inhalation, because the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. Compared to a balloon that has the size of a head a balloon the size of a fist will have more pressure or less pressure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"more pressure. To understand this, we first need to look at what happens when a balloon is inflated. The air inside the balloon exerts pressure on the interior surface of the latex or rubber material, pushing it outward. The elasticity of the material resists this force and creates an inward pressure. Eventually, a balance is reached between the outward and inward pressure, and the balloon maintains its inflated shape. Now let's compare a balloon the size of a head (larger balloon) to a balloon the size of a fist (smaller balloon). When you inflate a balloon to a smaller size, the air molecules inside have less space to move around, leading to an increased pressure. Conversely, when you inflate the balloon to a larger size, the air molecules have more space, and the pressure inside the balloon is lower. Referring back to the passage about air pressure in the lungs during inhalation, the concept is similar. When the chest volume is larger, the air pressure inside the lungs is lower than the air pressure outside. Therefore, compared to a balloon that has the size of a head, a balloon the size of a fist (which is smaller) will have more pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Here's why: Despite the fact that the situation itself could cause a wide range of emotions, we are given specific possible answers to choose from: ashamed, scared that Sasha was too nice, or angry at Sasha's outburst. Being 'ashamed' generally comes from feeling guilty or embarrassed about something one has done wrong. This emotion doesn't seem to fit because there's no clear indication that Addison did anything shameful. Being 'scared that Sasha was too nice' doesn't align with the situation either. The described situation suggests that Sasha is acting out-of-character and quite aggressively by yanking Addison into the kitchen to yell instead of being nice. That leaves us with being 'angry at Sasha's outburst.' The narrative indicates a physical (Sasha took Addison by the arm and yanked them into the kitchen) and verbal aggression (began yelling), which often triggers anger or upset in the receiving party.

When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: A personal journey into the heart of the Killing FieldsOne of the most harrowing and compelling personal documentaries of our time, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE exposes for the first time the truth about the Killing Fields and the Khmer Rouge who were behind Cambodias horrific genocide. More than simply an inquiry into Cambodias experience, however, ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE is a profound meditation on the nature of good and evil, shedding light on the capacity of some people to do terrible things and for others to forgive them.Winner of a dozen top documentary festival awards, including a Special Jury Prize at Sundance and the Grand Jury Award at the Full Frame Documentary Festival, this is a riveting film that takes audiences as close to witnessing evil as they are ever likely to get. It is also a personal journey into the heart of darkness by journalist/filmmaker Thet Sambath, whose family was wiped out in the Killing Fields, but whose patience and discipline elicits unprecedented on-camera confessions from perpetrators at all levels of the Khmer Rouge hierarchy. This is investigative journalism of the highest order.In 1974, Thet Sambaths father became one of the nearly two million people who were murdered by the Khmer Rouge when he refused to give them his buffalo. Sambaths mother was forced to marry a Khmer Rouge militiaman and died in childbirth in 1976, while his eldest brother disappeared in 1977. Sambath himself escaped Cambodia at age 10 when the Khmer Rouge fell in 1979.Fast forward to 1998, and Sambath, now a journalist, got to know the children of some senior Khmer Rouge cadre and gradually earned their trust. Then, for a decade, he spent weekends visiting the home of the most senior surviving leader, Nuon Chea, aka Brother Number Two under Pol Pot. But he never used to say anything different from what he told Western journalists, says Sambath, I was low-ranking, I knew nothing, I am not a killer.

(CNN) -- A month ago, Google's three-year effort to push its Web browser, Chrome, took a major step when analysts said it had passed Mozilla's Firefox to become the second-most popular tool of its kind on the Internet. Today, that climb continues and has some tech observers wondering whether Chrome could do the unthinkable and topple perennial leader Internet Explorer from atop the browser rankings. According to Web analytics firm StatCounter, the most popular version of Google's browser, Chrome 15, edged out Internet Explorer 8 in early December to become the world's most used edition of a browser. (For those keeping score, the totals were 23.6% of worldwide browser usage compared to IE8's 23.5%.) That's compared to about 37% for","completion":"Internet Explorer as a whole, which includes other versions of the browser. Meanwhile, Firefox accounts for roughly 25% of global browser usage. While the gap between Chrome and Internet Explorer is still significant, the trend of Chrome's growth has been substantial and has led to questions about whether it can eventually overtake Internet Explorer. If I were to develop a strategy to help Chrome become the most popular web browser, I would take the following steps: 1. Research key factors: Begin by researching the factors that have contributed to Chrome's growth in popularity and the factors that still make Internet Explorer the market leader. This information will help identify areas of improvement, potential marketing strategies, and user preferences. 2. Improve user experience: Ensure that Chrome has cutting-edge features and performance across different platforms. This may include faster browsing speeds, intuitive interface, easy syncing with other devices and Google services, strong security features, and adaptability to different operating systems. 3. Develop strategic partnerships: Collaborate with hardware manufacturers, operating system developers, and application creators to ensure Chrome is the default browser for new devices and systems. This will increase Chrome's visibility and adoption rate among users. 4. Target existing Internet Explorer users: Develop strategies specifically aimed at Internet Explorer users to encourage them to switch to Chrome. This may include offering personalized suggestions and tutorials to help them transfer their preferences and data from Internet Explorer to Chrome, creating feature comparisons, and highlighting Chrome's advantages. 5. Marketing campaign: Launch an aggressive marketing campaign that emphasizes Chrome's key strengths, such as its speed, security, and integration with Google services. Use various forms of media and platforms, including social media, to promote Chrome and encourage people to try it out. 6. Regular updates: Continuously improve and update Chrome's features, functionalities, and performance to maintain its competitive edge in the market and keep attracting new users. 7. Monitor progress: Track Chrome's growth and market share, and assess the effectiveness of the above strategies. Adjust the strategies as needed based on this data and feedback from users.

Carefully crafted by skilled artisans, the jar featured a unique and intricate design, with complex patterns etched into its thick glass walls. The narrow neck, however, turned out to be the jar's most prominent and confounding trait. Over the years, the jar had served the purpose of holding various rare and exotic liquids, delighting countless admirers with its beautiful craftsmanship. The ice, in this particular instance, had not been part of the original intent for this jar. By some quirk of fate, a sizeable chunk of ice had found its way into the jar, likely a result of someone's absentmindedness or, perhaps, an adventurous squirrel who was determined to find a solution to storing its winter food in an inaccessible location. Regardless, the ice now posed a significant challenge to the jar's current owner, a middle-aged woman by the name of Felicity. She was quite fond of her jar, often using it as a conversation piece during gatherings or just as an enhancement to her home. The mysterious ice, however, had now attracted the attention of her guests. It soon became apparent that conventional approaches would not work in retrieving the ice from the jar. Turning the jar upside down and vigorously shaking it had only resulted in sore arms and a headache. Placing the jar in a warm water bath seemed like an intelligent idea, but Felicity quickly realized that this would only serve to dissolve the ice and, as a consequence, the fascinating predicament would be lost. She was decidedly against breaking the jar, a move she viewed as a desperate last resort. Recalling a clever trick she had learned during her days of summer camping trips, Felicity decided to try salt. The trick involved adding salt to ice in an ice chest, as the salt would lower the freezing point, allowing the ice to melt faster without compromising its structural integrity. Excitedly, she grabbed a container of salt from her kitchen and carefully applied a small amount around the edge of the ice where it met the glass walls of the jar. This way, she hoped to encourage the ice to change its shape just enough to slip out of the jar's narrow opening. As the ice began to melt at a slightly faster pace, Felicity took this opportunity to gently shake the jar, urging the shifting ice to work its way out. To her delight, the ice gradually began to contract and, at last, after several minutes of patient coaxing, the ever-determined Felicity managed to retrieve the oddly-shaped ice from within her beloved jar. The feat may not have seemed grand from an outsider's perspective, but to Felicity, it was a testament to her resourcefulness and perseverance. With the ice safely removed, Felicity spent the remainder of the evening regaling her guests with the story of her triumph, the jar shimmered under warm electric light, returning to its original purpose of captivating the eyes and hearts of all who beheld it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: You'll need at least the following to make your drug store ready to open. This is only a suggested list, and you'll likely find that you need other items to get your store ready. Computers and all the necessary software. Cash registers. Phones and phone lines. Good-quality chairs for waiting areas. Make sure these chairs have arm rests so elderly or disabled patients can get up easily. Inventory for the front of the store, like paper towels, OTC drugs and products, food, cleaning supplies, and anything else you'd like to sell. Vials and pill bottles for the pharmacy. The store's layout is important for making customers want to shop with you. A cluttered store with a poor layout will drive away customers, which will hurt or even sink your business. Keep the following guidelines in mind when designing your floor plan. Have a cash register by the front door so customers can check out and then leave conveniently. Keep all pharmacy-related activities behind a counter in the back of the store. This will ensure that pharmacy staff can work efficiently, and is also important for safety. Make aisles wide enough for wheelchairs and people with disabilities to easily travel down. Designate an area for counseling. Your drug store should have a private area where pharmacists and techs can counsel patients on their medications. In some locations, this is even a law. Ideally this should be back by the pharmacy, so your pharmacist doesn't have to travel far from his post to counsel a patient. Organize aisles by product and hang signs above aisles indicating which products are there. This will help customers find what they need quickly and ensure they leave happy. All businesses need security in place to keep employees safe and protect your financial investment. You should look into surveillance cameras, alarms, grates for windows, and a safe to help thwart robberies. These certifications vary depending on the location of your pharmacy, so you'll have to consult local laws to ensure that you are meeting all necessary qualifications. It would be helpful to consult a lawyer who is familiar with the laws for your industry to make sure you are getting all the paperwork you need. For example, in the United States, a state pharmacy license. Each state has a board of pharmacy that evaluates pharmacies and grants licenses. Contact your state's board of pharmacy to get this certification. Sometimes the state board of pharmacy will also want to inspect your pharmacy before it opens, so stay in contact with this office to make sure you are complying with all laws. An additional requirement in the United States is a DEA number. The Drug Enforcement Agency regulates the sale of narcotics, so you will have to register with this agency for permission to do so. Contact your local DEA office to get federal certification. \\" Any new business will have a few bugs that have to get worked out- your drug store will be no exception. Therefore, it is a good idea to have some time before the official grand opening to work out the kinks. If you have a big flood of customers on your grand opening and you experience problems, you and your staff can easily be overwhelmed. If service suffers because of it, your store could get a bad reputation right from the start. To avoid big problems, open your doors one or two months before your actual grand opening. This will help you work out any kinks in your system with only a few customers to deal with. That way, you can make sure everything runs smoothly on your grand opening. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of this article offers a detailed guide for setting up a drug store, highlighting crucial steps, focusing on store layout, safety measures, legal certifications, and a soft opening to test the operations before the official grand opening.

Vote Leave have stepped up their focus on immigration, accusing David Cameron of harming public trust in politics with his pledge to cut net migration. Follow the latest updates on our live page In a joint letter to the prime minister, Mr Johnson and Justice Secretary Michael Gove said Mr Cameron's promise to reduce net migration to below 100,000 at last year's general election was \\"plainly not achievable as long as the UK is a member of the EU\\". Following the letter, a number of Conservative MPs broke ranks to call for Mr Cameron to quit even if the Remain campaign wins in 23 June's referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU. Nadine Dorries - a long standing backbench critic of the prime minister who says she would back Mr Johnson in any contest to replace him - predicted the PM would be \\"toast\\" if Remain won by a narrow margin. She told ITV's Peston on Sunday she had tabled a letter seeking a no-confidence vote in Mr Cameron. Fellow Leave campaigner Andrew Bridgen suggested more than the 50 Conservative MPs needed to trigger such a vote were ready to move against Mr Cameron. In his Today interview, Mr Clarke said Conservative in-fighting was \\"damaging to the referendum\\". \\"The public are getting fed up with Tory civil wars when they thought they were being asked about the future of this country for their children and grandchildren. \\"All this stuff about whether one or two backbenchers have signed letters calling for David Cameron to resign, I think most of the public would agree, is a bit of a diversion. \\"I think Boris and Donald Trump should go away for a bit and enjoy themselves and not get in the way of the serious issues which modern countries of the 21st century face.\\" Pressed on his opinion of Mr Johnson, he said: \\"He is a much nicer version of Donald Trump but the campaign is remarkably similar in my opinion and about as relevant to the real problems that the public face.\\" Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, who entered Parliament at the 2015 election, said she hoped hostilities between Tory MPs would cease after the referendum. \\"Of the new intake, the 2015 intake, we're very much hoping that after the referendum we can get back to doing the work we set out to do and that David Cameron as the prime minister will be leading that way,\\" she told BBC Radio 4's The World at One. Number 10 dismissed the personal attacks as a \\"distraction\\" intended to move attention away from the economic arguments for remaining in the EU.

A:","completion":"The last step of the process after a plant has used glucose to give itself energy is oxygen release. This process is called photosynthesis. In this photosynthetic process, energy captured from sunlight is used to convert carbon dioxide absorbed from the air and water absorbed from the soil, into glucose, which is a form of sugar. The plant uses this glucose as a kind of fuel to power all its activities, supporting growth, reproduction, and repair. The remaining by-product of this process is oxygen, which the plant releases back into the environment.

The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - The Green Mountains are a mountain range in the U.S. state of Vermont. The range runs primarily south to north and extends approximately from the border with Massachusetts to that with Quebec, Canada. The part of the same range that is in Massachusetts and Connecticut is known as The Berkshires or the Berkshire Hills (with the Connecticut portion, mostly in Litchfield County, locally called the Northwest Hills or Litchfield Hills) and the Quebec portion is called the Sutton Mountains, or Monts Sutton. - Lake Champlain (French: \\"Lac Champlain\\") is a natural freshwater lake in North America, mainly within the borders of the United States (states of Vermont and New York) but partially situated across the CanadaU.S. border in the Canadian province of Quebec. - Vermont is a state in the New England region of the northeast United States.

These locomotives are fueled by burning combustible materialusually coal/coke, wood, or oilto produce steam in a boiler. The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are mechanically connected to the locomotive's main wheels (drivers). Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive, either on the locomotive itself or in wagons (tenders) pulled behind. The first steam locomotive, made by Richard Trevithick, first operated on 21 February 1804, three years after the road locomotive he made in 1801. The first practical steam locomotive was built in 1812-13 by John Blenkinsop. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'occupation' with 'engineer'.

On 1 January 1948 Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\". Eventually, when Sándor was too ill to appear, Ferrier was able to recruit a Canadian pianist, John Newmark, with whom she formed a warm and lasting working relationship.

Sentence 2: \\"The strength of demand for credit increases the danger associated with delaying a tightening of policy that is called for on general macroeconomic grounds.\\" In both sentences: - The subject is \\"the strength of demand for credit.\\" - The effect of the subject is that it \\"increases the danger.\\" - The danger is related to \\"delaying\\" something. - That something is \\"called for on general macroeconomic grounds.\\" The only difference is the specific action being delayed: 1. In sentence 1, it is \\"a rate rise.\\" 2. In sentence 2, it is \\"a tightening of policy.\\" Given that \\"a rate rise\\" generally denotes an increase in interest rates, and \\"a tightening of policy\\" usually refers to actions taken by central banks to restrict credit, such as increasing interest rates, these two sentences are conveying the same meaning.

Background: Born in Goulburn, New South Wales, Poidevin played rugby at St Patrick's College (now Trinity Catholic College) in New South Wales, and made the Australian Schoolboy side. Upon finishing school he played a season with the Goulburn Rugby Union Football Club and then, in 1978, he moved to Sydney to study at the University of New South Wales, from which he graduated in 1983 with a Bachelor of Science (Hons). He made his first grade debut with the university's rugby union team in 1978. In 1982 he moved clubs to Randwick, the famous Galloping Greens, home of the Ella brothers and many other Wallabies. Context: Poidevin played for Sydney against France in the third game France played for their 1981 France rugby union tour of Australia, won by Sydney 16-14. Poidevin then played for New South Wales against France for the fifth match of France's Australia tour, lost 12-21. Poidevin achieved national selection for the two-Test series against France, despite competition for backrow positions in the Australian team. The first Test against France marked the first time Poidevin played with Australian eightman Mark Loane and contained the first try Poidevin scored at international Test level. In his biography For Love Not Money, written with Jim Webster, Poidevin recalls that: The first France Test at Ballymore held special significance for me because I was playing alongside Loaney for the first time. In my eyes he was something of a god, and I guess my feeling was the same as a young actor getting a bit part in a movie with Dustin Hoffman. Loaney was a huge inspiration, and I tailed him around the field hoping to feed off him whenever he made one of those titanic bursts where he'd split the defence wide open with his unbelievable strength and speed. Sticking to him in that Test paid off handsomely, because Loaney splintered the Frenchmen in one charge, gave to me and I went for the line for all I was worth. I saw Blanco coming at me out of the corner of my eye, but was just fast enough to make the corner for my first Test try. I walked back with the whole of the grandstand yelling and cheering. God and Loaney had been good to me.\\" Poidevin played in Australia's second Test against France in Sydney, won by Australia 24-14, giving Australia a 2-0 series victory. Question: was he a good player Answer:","completion":"Yes, Poidevin was a good player, as evidenced by his achievements and experiences throughout his rugby career. He played for multiple clubs, including representing Sydney and New South Wales against France during their 1981 tour of Australia. Furthermore, he was selected for the Australian national team for the two-Test series against France, despite strong competition for backrow positions. Poidevin also scored his first international Test try during the first Test match against France, demonstrating his skill and ability to perform at a high level. His admiration and collaboration with fellow player Mark Loane further highlights his talent and drive for success in the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone. Q: Which gases trap heat in the atmosphere? A: A:","completion":"The paragraph provided indicates that greenhouse gases are responsible for trapping heat in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's temperature by absorbing and emitting radiation within the thermal infrared range. Specifically, the following gases mentioned in the paragraph act as heat trappers in the atmosphere: 1. Carbon Dioxide (CO2): Carbon dioxide is the most well-known greenhouse gas, and it is also the most abundant. It is primarily released into the atmosphere through human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and other industrial processes. CO2 traps heat by absorbing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and then re-emitting it back towards the surface, amplifying the greenhouse effect. 2. Methane (CH4): Methane is another significant greenhouse gas, and it has a much higher Global Warming Potential (GWP) compared to carbon dioxide. Although methane is present in lower concentrations in the atmosphere, it is around 25 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2. Major sources of methane include natural processes like wetlands and termites, as well as human activities such as agriculture, livestock production, and the extraction of fossil fuels. 3. Water Vapor (H2O): Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere, and it plays a vital role in the global climate system. As water vapor absorbs heat, it amplifies the greenhouse effect, causing a positive feedback loop of increased warming. Moreover, as the Earth's temperature rises due to increased concentrations of other greenhouse gases, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases, further enhancing the warming effect. 4. Ozone (O3): Ozone acts as both a greenhouse gas and a protective layer around the Earth. Ozone found in the Earth's lower atmosphere, known as tropospheric ozone, is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. It is produced through complex chemical reactions involving other pollutants, like nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. Conversely, ozone present in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere) acts as a shield that protects life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. However, the ozone layer has been significantly depleted due to the release of ozone-depleting substances, mainly Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs). In summary, the main gases that trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere are carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone. These greenhouse gases are vital in maintaining our planet's habitability, keeping Earth's temperature stable and within a range suitable for life. However, excessive concentrations of these gases, primarily caused by human activities, have led to an enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming, posing significant challenges to ecosystems, human health, and the overall climate system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Euboea or Evia (Modern Greek: , \\"Evvoia\\" \\"Eúboia\\") is the second-largest Greek island in area and population, after Crete.

The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. - An archipelago, sometimes called an island group or island chain, is a chain, cluster or collection of islands. The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - An islet is a very small island. Types. As suggested by its origin as \\"islette\\", an Old French diminutive of \\"isle\\", use of the term implies small size, but little attention is given to drawing an upper limit on its applicability. - Thessaloniki is the second-largest city in Greece and the capital of Greek Macedonia, the administrative region of Central Macedonia and the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace.

It also appears on company posters and t-shirts. This is not the first time the likeness of Dr. Roof as \\"Chucktown Follicle Brown,\\" has been used. In Spring of 2014, the photo appears in advertisements for technology conference Dig South. Roof says a church in Lubbock, Texas also used the photo for a mustache event. In 2007, the South Carolina native founded the Holy City Beard and Moustache Society. Each year, the group hosts a regional championship, and has partnered with Holy City Brewing as a sponsor each of its five years.

The bomber is believed to have detonated his explosives near the entrance to a busy market. The attack comes as Afghans prepare to hold presidential elections on 5 April. No group has so far said it carried out the bombing. However, Taliban insurgents and the al-Qaeda affiliated group the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan are active in the volatile region. Mr Batash said the attacker had been riding a three-wheel motorcycle when he detonated his explosives. \\"It was a local market day. Hundreds of local farmers and villagers bring their produce. All of those killed and injured are civilians,\\" he said. Witness Sayed Agha, 43, told the BBC: \\"I was busy buying bread when I heard a huge bang. I saw dead bodies and blood all around me.\\" Correspondents say security is likely to be severely tested during the election, where candidates include warlords and former guerrilla leaders from the civil war in the 1990s. The Taliban have threatened to target anyone who takes part in the polls. In recent days, the country's election commission has closed 396 polling centres in 15 provinces citing security concerns, says the BBC's Bilal Sarwary in Kabul. The majority were closed in Faryab province, our correspondent adds. The last remaining contingent of Nato-led forces is due to leave the country by the end of the year, having handed over security to Afghan forces. The United Nations says 2,959 civilians were killed and 5,656 wounded in Afghanistan last year, a 14% rise from the previous year.

What are the eight dynamics Add punctuation","completion":"The eight dynamics are a concept in Scientology, a belief system founded by L. Ron Hubbard. These dynamics represent the various aspects of life that people engage in, and function as a guide to understand and achieve success and happiness. By balancing these dynamics, individuals can reach their full potential and lead a satisfying life. The eight dynamics are as follows: 1. Self (First Dynamic): This dynamic focuses on the individual and his or her self-preservation. It includes one's body, mind, and personal abilities. By embracing personal growth and self-improvement, individuals can enhance their first dynamic and lead a healthier, more fulfilling life. 2. Family and Procreation (Second Dynamic): This dynamic encompasses relationships, particularly those within one's immediate family, such as spouses, children, parents, and siblings. The second dynamic also includes the act of procreation, ensuring the continuation of one's family line. Strong, supportive relationships are essential for maintaining a healthy balance in this dynamic. 3. Groups (Third Dynamic): The third dynamic encompasses one's social interactions with others, such as friends, coworkers, and community members. Participation in and contribution to groups help individuals develop a sense of belonging and camaraderie. A healthy third dynamic involves the establishment of positive and beneficial relationships with others. 4. Humanity (Fourth Dynamic): This dynamic extends beyond personal groups and relationships to encompass all human beings. It involves a sense of responsibility for humanity as a whole and promotes actions that benefit society at large. Working towards the betterment of humankind, understanding different cultures, and helping those in need contribute to a healthy fourth dynamic. 5. Life Forms (Fifth Dynamic): The fifth dynamic focuses on all living entities, including plants, animals, and ecosystems. This dynamic emphasizes the interconnectedness of all life forms and the importance of preserving and protecting the environment. Promoting conservation, adopting sustainable practices, and respecting the balance of nature contribute to a healthy fifth dynamic. 6. Physical Universe (Sixth Dynamic): This dynamic involves the material world, including the Earth and the entirety of the physical universe. Exploration, understanding, and mastering the physical realm are key components of a healthy sixth dynamic. By striving to understand the laws of physics, chemistry, and other scientific disciplines, individuals contribute to their advancement on this dynamic. 7. Spiritual (Seventh Dynamic): The seventh dynamic focuses on the spiritual aspect of life, which includes the individual's quest for enlightenment and the understanding of one’s true nature. It emphasizes personal spiritual development through practices such as meditation, prayer, and introspection. A healthy seventh dynamic involves a connection with one's higher self, understanding the purpose of life, and seeking spiritual growth. 8. Supreme Being (Eighth Dynamic): The eighth and final dynamic encompasses the concept of a Supreme Being, whether that being is represented as God, a higher power, or a divine force. This dynamic acknowledges the existence of a higher power guiding and shaping the universe. A healthy eighth dynamic involves a strong spiritual connection with this Supreme Being and the ability to find meaning and direction in one's life. In conclusion, the eight dynamics in Scientology serve as a framework for understanding various aspects of life, from individual self-preservation to the broader concepts of the universe and the Supreme Being. By focusing on and cultivating each dynamic, individuals can achieve a well-rounded, fulfilling life that contributes positively to their personal development and the world around them."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.

In this case, the input is the population of the country at different points in time, and the gain is the percent increase in population. For the first half of the 20th century, the population increased by 200%. That means the population became 1 (initial population) + 2 (200% gain) = 3 times larger. For the second half of the 20th century, the population increased by 300%. That means the population at the end of the first half becomes 1 (population at the end of the first half) + 3 (300% gain) = 4 times larger. To find the total increase for the 20th-century population as a whole, we multiply the gains: (3) * (4) = 12. This means that the population became 12 times larger than its size at the beginning of the century. To express this increase as a percentage, we subtract 1 from the total gain and then multiply by 100: (12 - 1) * 100 = 11 * 100 = 1100%.

So when she finally walked out with shiny teeth,a sore mouth and a broken spirit,I told her I was proud of her and took her to Ben &Jerry's for an ice cream reward.Two weeks later,we returned to the scene of the crime.The dentist spent about 45 seconds checking her teeth before sending her on her merry way.Before I could start the car, she was placing her ice cream order.She was shocked when I told her that she wasn't going to get a reward every time we get her teeth checked. Clearly,she's not alone.According to some parenting experts,kids are easily addicted to a benefit--producing system of parental rewards and bribes--it's not all ice creams,candies and cool toys.Some parents are offering their children prizes to just let them sit down and behave in a restaurant--or sleep in their own beds--or score a goal in the next soccer game. While the experts agree that occasional awards are okay, the danger lies in the system's overuse.Kids quickly gain a sense of entitlement ,where they come to expect a big reward for every good thing that they do,no matter how small.To keep things in check,experts say parents should reduce the number of rewards they offer,make sure rewards match the behavior and explain the real benefits of behaving for the sake of behaving. Have you used bribery or a reward system with your kids? Was it successful? Do your kids expect more because of that system? Question: Similar to the author's daughter,children _ .

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Trump’s Cessna flew to Montreal on May 4, it certainly was not for a campaign event. Instead, the quick Montreal trip was a bureaucratic barrel roll, evading a monthlong wait — effectively cutting a line of other airplane owners — to be allowed to fly the plane again. The plane had been grounded in April by the Federal Aviation Administration for having an expired registration, forcing Mr. Trump to use his much larger Boeing 757 during one of the final weeks of the Republican nominating fight. Mr. Trump’s Cessna Citation X landed a little after 11 a.m. at Trudeau airport in Montreal on May 4. Less than 20 minutes later, according to air traffic control communications, the plane was preparing to take off again. And less than 20 minutes after that, it was in the air, headed back to Connecticut. The trip to Montreal followed a slew of paperwork that was filed April 22. That day, the plane was sold by a Trump-controlled company to another, DT Endeavor I LLC, which promptly registered its newly acquired airplane with the government. That second corporation was created in mid-January, before the Cessna’s registration expired. Its underlying assets are listed only as “aircraft” on Mr. Trump’s most recent financial statement. Its name, generic and in keeping with Mr. Trump’s usual naming convention for his companies, suggests it may have been lying idle until some purpose was found for it. Along with the paperwork for the sale, Mr. Trump filed a declaration of international operations, requesting “expedited registration in support of” the international flight, scheduled for May 4 to Montreal, which is the closest Canadian international airport to the New York area. The international flight prompted speedier processing for the plane’s registration with the new owner. If a plane’s registration expires, the owner has to wait in line to re-register it, a process that can take months. When a plane is sold, the new owner also has to wait for the plane’s new registration certificate. But the F.A.A. lets new plane owners — like Mr. Trump’s second L.L.C. — jump ahead of this line if they plan to take the new plane on an international trip. Mr. Trump was taking advantage of a bureaucratic maneuver that is not readily available. The F.A.A. does not advertise the technique on its website. Mr. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The plane’s registration had expired at the beginning of February. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump continued to use it to fly to many of his campaign events, until the F.A.A. ordered it grounded after The New York Times revealed the paperwork problem. So a plan was made to fly to Montreal. As a result, the same day as the paperwork was filed, the F.A.A. granted Mr. Trump’s plane a temporary certificate of registration, clearing it to fly again. There is deep concern among Republicans about political divisions and the future of the party, a new Times/CBS News poll shows. We want to hear from the party’s longtime members or those who have just registered as Republicans. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses how Donald Trump's Cessna Citation X plane, which was grounded in April 2016 by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) due to an expired registration, regained permission to fly by exploiting a bureaucratic loophole. The Cessna was initially owned by a Trump-controlled company but was later sold to another company, DT Endeavor I LLC. In order to navigate the bureaucratic process, Trump filed a declaration of international operations for an expedited registration supporting an international flight scheduled for May 4 to Montreal, which is the closest Canadian international airport to the New York area. As a result, the FAA granted the plane a temporary certificate of registration on the same day the paperwork was filed, allowing it to fly again. Flying the plane to Montreal enabled the new owner, DT Endeavor I LLC, to jump ahead of the usual waiting period, which can take months, since the FAA allows new plane owners to do so if they plan to take the new plane on an international trip. This bureaucratic maneuver is not widely known or advertised by the FAA, and Trump's campaign did not comment on the matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Skin is cut or damaged - Bacteria enters through the wound - The bacteria reproduces and spreads - Causes symptoms Answer:","completion":"The final step of this process is the body's immune response and eventual healing of the infected wound. Here is a detailed explanation of what happens in this stage: 1. Immune response: When the skin is cut or damaged and bacteria enter the wound, the body's immune system is triggered. The immune system is responsible for detecting and eliminating foreign substances like bacteria and viruses that can harm the body. Its primary goal is to prevent or limit the infection from spreading. In the case of a bacterial wound infection, the immune response entails the following actions: a. Detection of the invading bacteria: Cells known as macrophages present in the affected skin tissue identify the bacteria as foreign substances and release chemical signals called cytokines. These cytokines help to recruit and activate other immune cells to the site of infection. b. Recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection: Neutrophils and other white blood cells are attracted to the wound site by cytokines and other chemical signals. They rapidly arrive at the site of infection to target the bacteria. c. Inflammation: The increased blood flow to the wound area caused by the cytokines and other chemical signals results in inflammation. This can manifest as redness, warmth, and swelling around the wound. Pain may also be experienced due to the accumulation of these immune cells and inflammatory substances near nerve endings in the area. d. Killing and removal of bacteria: Neutrophils and other white blood cells engage in phagocytosis, a process where they engulf and destroy the bacteria. After destroying the bacteria, these immune cells die, and their remains, along with dead bacteria and tissue debris, form pus. 2. Healing of the infected wound: Once the bacterial invasion has been controlled, the body initiates the wound healing process. This occurs in several stages as follows: a. Hemostasis: If blood vessels were damaged due to the skin injury, they would need to be sealed to prevent excessive bleeding. This is achieved by forming a temporary clot, which later gets replaced by more durable fibrin, a protein that forms a mesh-like structure to hold the damaged tissues together. b. Inflammatory phase: This phase overlaps with the immune response to bacteria. The wound remains inflamed as the immune system fends off further bacterial invasion and clears the infection. c. Proliferative phase: Once the infection has been controlled, cells called fibroblasts begin producing collagen, a structural protein that provides strength to the new tissue. Blood vessels also start regrowing in the wound area to supply nutrients and oxygen to the repairing cells. d. Remodeling phase: In this phase, the collagen fibers in the scar tissue are reorganized, and the wound becomes stronger. Over time, the appearance of the scar may become less noticeable, although it may never completely disappear. Throughout this process, it is essential to keep the wound clean and cared for to minimize the risk of reinfection or complications. Depending on the severity of the wound and the bacterial infection, antibiotics may be prescribed by a healthcare provider to help eliminate the bacteria, aiding the body's immune response."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. Question: Why did Barend's shadow caught the narrator's eye? Options: - Because he was a boring kid - Because he wore faded jeans - He had the most incredible shadow - not enough information === The correct answer is A:","completion":"He had the most incredible shadow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Passage: Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists. The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °C (100–106 °F), headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.

Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\", answer the following question.

Former State Sen. Kelli Ward, who lost a primary to McCain running from the right in 2016 and is now trying to win the GOP nomination for retiring Sen. Jeff Flake's seat, made the suggestion in response to a Facebook post by a campaign aide. According to screenshots of the conversation posted on Twitter by Arizona political reporters, the aide, Jonathan Williams, wondered if it was \\"just a coincidence\\" that the announcement of McCain ending medical treatment came the day Ward was launching a statewide bus tour, her big push before Tuesday's primary. Ward replied: \\"I think they wanted to have a particular narrative that is negative to me.\\" After her response was Tweeted out, Ward deleted the post and replaced it with one claiming the media was concocting a story. \\"I've said again and again to pray for Senator McCain & his family,\\" Ward wrote. \\"These decisions are terrible to have to make. I feel compassion for him and his family as they go through this.\\" Ward has acknowledged she is the underdog in Tuesday's primary. She faces Rep.

Imagine you want to tell a computer what to do, like draw a picture or solve a math problem. A programming language helps you give those instructions in a way that the computer can understand. Just like people speak different languages, computers can understand different programming languages too. Now, let's answer your questions. First question: Since it is 2021 now, I will answer for this year. Right now, some popular programming languages are Python, JavaScript, and Java. The best one to learn can depend on what you want to do with it. For example, if you like making websites, JavaScript might be best, but if you like math or science, Python could be a better choice. Second question: For a beginner, Python is often the best programming language to learn because it is easy to understand and can be used for many different things. It's like a simple language you can learn before trying harder languages. Your last question asks if the first two questions are the same. The answer is \\"no\\" because: - The first question asks, \\"What is the best programming language for 2016?\\", which could vary based on popular languages and demand in 2016. - The second question asks, \\"What is the best programming language for a beginner?\\", which focuses on easy-to-learn languages that are good for someone new to programming.

The reason Michael did not cook noodles is that he was preparing a lasagna dish, which typically consists of layers of pasta, ricotta cheese, and a mixture of ground meat and tomato sauce, all baked together in the oven. In this case, Michael chose to use no-boil lasagna noodles, which are designed to soften and cook as the lasagna bakes, eliminating the need to pre-cook them. In contrast, Randy was cooking a different recipe that required cooked noodles as part of the dish's preparation. This could be anything from a simple pasta dish with sauce, vegetables, and protein to a more complex recipe such as baked ziti or stuffed shells. The process involved cooking the noodles first before combining them with the rest of the ingredients, ensuring a balanced and consistent texture throughout the dish. It is essential to follow a recipe's instructions when it comes to pre-cooking pasta, as the outcome and final texture of the dish can be greatly affected by this step. Undercooked pasta can result in a chewy, unappetizing texture, while overcooked pasta might become mushy and easily broken during the assembly and final cooking process. This scenario highlights the importance of understanding the ingredients and the appropriate preparation techniques required for different dishes. While both Randy and Michael were utilizing noodles as a primary component in their respective recipes, the difference in their final output and cooking methods demonstrates how versatile pasta can be in creating a wide variety of delicious meals. In summary, Randy cooked noodles for his recipe, while Michael chose not to because of the specific requirements of the lasagna dish he was preparing. This exemplifies the significance of carefully following a recipe and being aware of the distinct ways pasta may be used as the cornerstone of a meal."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In the US, the most popular way to welcome the new year is with a big party.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Literature, in its broadest sense, is any single body of written works. More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily cartoon panels in American newspapers alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes. - Guy Berkeley \`\` Berke '' Breathed ( / brðd / BREDH - d ; born June 21 , 1957 ) is an American cartoonist , children 's book author / illustrator , director and screenwriter , best known for Bloom County , a 1980s cartoon - comic strip that dealt with sociopolitical issues as understood by fanciful characters ( e.g. , Bill the Cat and Opus the Penguin ) and through humorous analogies . Bloom County earned Breathed the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning in 1987 . - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - The Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States. It was established in 1917 by provisions in the will of American (Hungarian-born) Joseph Pulitzer who had made his fortune as a newspaper publisher, and is administered by Columbia University in New York City. Prizes are awarded yearly in twenty-one categories. In twenty of the categories, each winner receives a certificate and a US15,000 cash award (raised from 10,000 starting in 2017). The winner in the public service category of the journalism competition is awarded a gold medal. - The Daily Texan is the student newspaper of the University of Texas at Austin. It is entirely student-run and independent from the university (although its operations are overseen by an entity with faculty, student, and newspaper industry representatives). It is one of the largest college newspapers in the United States, with a daily circulation of roughly 30,000 during the fall and spring semesters, and it is among the oldest student newspapers in the South. The \\"Texan\\" has won more national, regional and state awards than any other college newspaper in America and counts 10 Pulitzer Prize winners among its former staff. - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States.

It was established in 1754 as King's College by royal charter of George II of Great Britain. Columbia is the oldest college in the state of New York and the fifth chartered institution of higher learning in the country, making it one of nine colonial colleges founded before the Declaration of Independence. After the American Revolutionary War, King's College briefly became a state entity, and was renamed Columbia College in 1784.

Cartoonists may work in many formats, such as animation, booklets, comic strips, comic books, editorial cartoons, graphic novels, manuals, gag cartoons, graphic design, illustrations, storyboards, posters, shirts, books, advertisements, greeting cards, magazines, newspapers, and video game packaging. - The Academia Waltz was Berkeley Breathed's first cartoon, published daily from 1978 to 1979 in \\"The Daily Texan\\" at The University of Texas at Austin, where he was a student. The strip focused primarily on college life, although it sometimes made references to big news stories of the time (such as the Three Mile Island accident in 1979). - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public.

The word is also used elsewhere in the arts such as songwriter but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition. - Bloom County is an American comic strip by Berkeley Breathed which originally ran from December 8, 1980, until August 6, 1989. It examined events in politics and culture through the viewpoint of a fanciful small town in Middle America, where children often have adult personalities and vocabularies and where animals can talk. It originated from a comic strip known as \\"The Academia Waltz\\", which Breathed produced for the student newspaper, \\"The Daily Texan\\", while attending the University of Texas. - Joseph Pulitzer (born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847 October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the \\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\\" and the \\"New York World\\".

Question: how does an earthworm eat & digests food.? Would \\"At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis , which are waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall.\\" be a reasonable answer? Select from: A). No B). Yes Answer:","completion":"A). No An earthworm's digestive process is different from the process described in the statement. While peristalsis does play a role in the movement of food through the earthworm's body, there are more specific steps involved in their eating and digestion process that should be included in any explanation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the earthworm's digestive process: 1. Ingestion: The earthworm ingests organic matter, soil, and microorganisms through its mouth. 2. Pharynx: The ingested material is passed into the pharynx, which generates suction to help pull the material into the digestive tract. 3. Esophagus: The food enters the esophagus, which secretes calcium carbonate to regulate pH levels inside the earthworm's gut. This helps with digestion. 4. Crop: Next, the food moves into the crop, where it is temporarily stored. 5. Gizzard: The material then enters the gizzard, where strong muscular contractions grind the soil and organic material into smaller particles. 6. Intestine: The food now enters the intestine where digestive enzymes break down the organic matter, making nutrients available for absorption. 7. Absorption: Nutrients are absorbed into the earthworm's bloodstream through the intestinal walls. 8. Excretion: The undigested material, such as small pieces of soil, is excreted through the anus as castings. In summary, while peristalsis aids in the movement of food through an earthworm's body, the actual processes, stages, and functions of digestion are more complex than what is described in the given statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"What did these stories consist of?\\" Answer: \\"Earth\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer provided is not correct. The correct answer would be something like this: These stories often consisted of myths and legends about giant creatures or monsters that were believed to have once roamed the Earth. The discovery of unusual fossil remains sparked the imagination of ancient people, leading to the creation of tales about dragons, griffins, and other fantastical creatures. The awe-inspiring size and appearance of these fossils fueled these stories, with many ancient cultures attempting to interpret the meaning behind these findings within the context of their beliefs and understanding of the world. In some cases, these stories served as cautionary tales or allegorical lessons, while in other instances, they were integrated into the belief systems and folklore of the civilizations that encountered the fossils.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which ocean is probably connected to less oceans with higher salinities? The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters. Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to less oceans with higher salinities. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the Madrigal Ocean has a much lower salinity than the Listy Ocean, similar to the Arctic Ocean on Earth. The Arctic Ocean's lower salinity is attributed to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. It is reasonable to assume that a similar situation might apply to the Madrigal Ocean, causing its salinity to be lower as well."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game. Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this. And if you don't have enough time to study for a test because of swim practice, you need to talk with your parents about how to balance swimming and school.

I've heard nothing but great things about the 2006 television mini-series, \\"Planet Earth,\\" narrated by my childhood idol David Attenborough. Nevertheless, whether it was screened down here in Australia or not, I never caught up with it, and when I happened upon the opportunity to see 'Earth (2007)'  a feature-length compilation of the same nature footage  on the big screen, I jumped at the chance. The theatre was basically empty; just one other patron sat in the row ahead of me, and it was as though I had, not only the big screen to myself, but, indeed, the entire planet Earth. For 90 minutes, I was lowered into the beauty and perils of the isolated wilderness, amongst some of the most beautiful living creatures ever captured on film. Awesome in its scope, and yet painfully intimate at times, 'Earth' is a heartfelt plea from the filmmakers to recognise the delicate balance of life on our planet, and how the intrusion of humans has placed countless glorious animal and plant species on the brink of extinction. Though the film, directed by Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, obviously argues for the conservation of the wilderness, it refrains from beating us over the head with propaganda, and the puzzle that is politics is ignored altogether; indeed, there is not a human in sight. Instead, we are simply taken on a breathtaking journey into the majesty of the natural world, to experience the resilience, and also the fragility, of life on Earth. I hear that the original mini-series, which ran for eleven episodes, delves a lot deeper into the scientific background of world ecosystems, but I think that, here, the filmmakers made a wise decision to replace information with emotional impact: I can't remember the last time that I felt so inspired, and yet utterly heartbroken at the same time. By establishing an emotional link between the audience and a select few individual animals, anthropomorphising them to an extent, we are suddenly able to appreciate the \\"human side\\" of each species, and their hopeless plight for survival becomes less a statistic and more an unacceptable tragedy. 'Earth' is basically comprised of a selection of dramatic episodes, whether it be the struggles of a female polar bear to lead her young cubs to the Arctic ice, or the tramp of an elephant herd towards the life-saving seasonal floodwaters of the Okavango Delta. The documentary demonstrates the delicate balance between life and death, most heartbreakingly exhibited in the desperate ballet of predator-prey interactions. Though occasionally, perhaps to cater towards a younger audience, the footage cuts itself short at the crucial moment, I regularly shed at tear at the inevitability of death in nature, and the raw instinct that fuels these animals' final, hopeless efforts at survival. There's even a haunting beauty to be found in the hunt, both in the slow-motion footage of a cheetah bringing down its prey {the result of a single fateful misstep}, or the majestic mid-air leap of a Great White Shark as it engulfs a hapless sea lion. It is this frail balance that has been fatally disrupted by the selfishness of our own species. Aside from these main stories, we are also treated to brief snippets of wildlife from around the world, including the birds of paradise of Papua New Guinea, and the autumn migration of the demoiselle cranes. Of course, entire films might have been dedicated to these species alone, and an inevitable consequence of having to sift through so much footage is that some interesting ecosystems are glossed over far took quickly. By choosing to focus most closely on the polar bear, elephant and humpback whale  tracing their lifestyles, via some astonishing high-definition time-lapse photography, throughout a calender year  the filmmakers were able to avoid any structural problems that might arise from having so much to show, and only 90 minutes to show it. Consequently, 'Earth' left me thirsting for more, and, fortunately, I now have approximately eleven hours more, as soon as I can track down a copy of the DVD box-set for \\"Planet Earth.\\" Uplifting and tear-jerking, awe-inspiring and heartrending, 'Earth' is a truly magnificent documentary experience, and it might just be my favourite film of 2007.

We need to find the value of \\"y.\\" To do this, we need to put all the terms with \\"y\\" on one side of the equation and all the numbers on the other side. Let's start by simplifying the numbers: We got -8555 + 2155, which are different signs. To add them, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one like this: 8555 - 2155 = 6400. Since -8555 is negative, our answer is -6400. Now, we have -191*y - 6400 - 13970 = 100*y Next, add the numbers on the left side: -6400 - 13970 = -20370 So now we have -191*y - 20370 = 100*y Now, we need to move the \\"100*y\\" from the right side to the left side. To do that, we'll subtract \\"100*y\\" from both sides: -191*y - 100*y = 20370 This combines to: -291*y = 20370 Almost there! Now we need to solve for \\"y.\\" To do this, we'll divide both sides by -291: y = 20370 / -291 Now, when we divide 20370 by 291, we get -70. So, y = -70. That's the answer!

Here is a news article: President Donald Trump walks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at the White House in Washington, Monday, April 3, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) President Donald Trump walks with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at the White House in Washington, Monday, April 3, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Archives and Records Administration has told the White House to keep each of President Donald Trump's tweets, even those he deletes or corrects, and the White House has agreed. The head of the archives, David S. Ferriero, told two Democratic senators in a letter last week that the White House has assured him it's saving all Trump's Twitter blasts. The archives contacted the White House about the matter because the Presidential Records Act requires such correspondence to be preserved for history. Ferriero did not say when the agency contacted White House officials to remind them about the records requirement, but officials briefed the White House counsel's office about the law on Feb. 2, according to the archivist's letter to Sens. Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Tom Carper of Delaware. The archivist's letter, dated March 30, doesn't describe precisely how the White House is saving Trump's tweets. The Obama administration used an automated system to isolate and preserve copies of President Barack Obama's tweets. McCaskill and Carper raised the issue of Trump's tweets in early March following a spate of instances in which the president had deleted or altered earlier tweets. The two senators had previously raised concerns about Trump's tweets in a letter to White House counsel Don McGahn. The two senators also pressed the archives for information about reports that some White House staffers had been ordered to avoid emails or use smartphone apps that do not preserve emails because of Trump administration concerns about leaks to the media. Ferriero told them he was aware of those press reports but said that White House guidance \\"to all employees expressly forbids the use of such apps.\\" Ferriero also said he was not aware of government officials who have been instructed to avoid using email as a method of work-related communication. Trump's almost-daily use of his official White House Twitter account and his separate private Twitter account has been heavily scrutinized by the media and by political friends and foes since his November election and even more so since his inauguration. Three minutes before he took the oath of office in January, Trump tweeted from his private account that he was \\"honered to serve you, the great American people, as your 45th President of the United States.\\" The misspelled word in the tweet was later altered to \\"honored\\" and then the tweet was deleted entirely. Unlike the archives' clear guidance on saving Trump's tweets, the agency has not provided any guidance to government agencies about preserving communications to and from Trump's smartphones and agencies have not requested guidance, Ferriero said. The two senators raised concerns with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis about whether communications from Trump's old smartphone were being preserved. Trump reportedly replaced his old unsecured Android smartphone with a secured iPhone but continued using the unsecured phone for tweeting through late March. The senators had also written to McGahn in February, asking about reports that at least four senior Trump White House officials \\"maintained active email accounts on a private email system.\\" Newsweek had reported in January that senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, chief strategist Steve Bannon, counselor Kellyanne Conway and press secretary Sean Spicer all were using private email accounts on a Republican National Committee system. Trump repeatedly criticized Democratic president opponent Hillary Clinton for her extensive use of private emails when she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. According to an agenda of the Feb. 2 briefing with White House officials, archives general counsel Gary M. Stern and John Laster, director of the agency's presidential materials division, explained that the president and White House counsel were \\"solely responsible for managing presidential records.\\" The role of the archives, they added, is mostly advisory, but presidential records can only be disposed of after the White House consults the archivist in writing. ||||| The National Archives has advised the White House to save all of President Trump's tweets, even the ones he deletes, according to a letter the agency sent to two Democratic senators. \\"[The National Archives and Records Administration] has advised the White House that it should capture and preserve all tweets that the president posts in the course of his official duties, including those that are subsequently deleted, as presidential records,\\" Archivist of the United States David S. Ferriero wrote in a letter to Sens. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Tom Carper, D-Del. Ferriero also wrote that White House officials have informed the National Archives that they \\"are, in fact, doing so,\\" but did not detail the process for doing so. McCaskill and Carper, who sit on the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, sent a letter to the National Archives March 7 over concerns about whether the Trump administration was complying with the Presidential Records Act of 1978, which requires the United States to preserve presidential records. The National Archives briefed the White House counsel's office on the records act in February, and has since been in communication with the office on a \\"regular basis,\\" the letter states. The Presidential Records Act \\"places the responsibility for the custody and management\\" of records with the president. The National Archives can only advise the Office of the Counsel in collecting presidential records. If President Trump wants to dispose of any of his records that \\"no longer have administrative, historical, informational or evidentiary value,\\" he would have to first consult with Ferriero and obtain his written views. President Trump has two Twitter accounts -- @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS – from which he posts regularly. McCaskill, Carper and other critics are concerned that Trump may be violating the Presidential Records Act when he deletes tweets. One such example came on Inauguration Day when Trump tweeted and deleted, \\"I am honered to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!\\" He then posted another tweet immediately after with the same wording, but correctly spelling \\"honored.\\" House Oversight Committee leaders also sent a letter March 9 to the White House counsel's office, asking for more details on how it's conducting the records preservation. The White House did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has instructed the White House to keep all of President Donald Trump's tweets, including those he deletes or corrects.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"To analyze the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Pat cured of pneumonia,\\" I'll go through the following steps: 1. Identify the components of the sentence: In this sentence, we have a subject \\"Pat,\\" a verb \\"cured,\\" and a prepositional phrase \\"of pneumonia.\\" 2. Examine the subject: The subject \\"Pat\\" is clear and functions correctly as a person's name. 3. Examine the verb: The verb \\"cured\\" suggests that someone's condition has been treated or resolved. However, based on the given information, we cannot determine who cured Pat. There might be a passive voice mismatch. 4. Examine the prepositional phrase: The preposition \\"of\\" alongside the noun \\"pneumonia\\" indicates the condition Pat had. However, it should be connected to the verb more clearly in a passive voice construction or rephrased to show the action being performed on the subject. 5. Assess clarity and coherence: The intended meaning of the sentence is somewhat understandable. Pat had pneumonia, and now they are cured. However, the sentence is not grammatically correct, and it could be restructured for better clarity. Considering these steps, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"Pat cured of pneumonia\\" is not strong. A better alternative would be \\"Pat was cured of pneumonia\\" or \\"Pat has been cured of pneumonia.\\" Both alternatives provide a clear passive voice construction by adding \\"was\\" and \\"has been\\" before the verb \\"cured,\\" specifying that an action was performed on Pat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So, you want to know how to prepare the fruit for a traditional sangria and which method is more reasonable. First, let me explain what sangria is. Sangria is a yummy drink that comes from Spain. It has wine, fruit, and some other sweet ingredients mixed together. Now, here's how you prepare the fruit for sangria: 1. Pick some yummy fruits like oranges, lemons, apples, and berries. 2. Ask an adult to help you wash the fruits so they are clean and safe to eat. 3. The adult can also help you cut the fruits into small pieces, so they can fit in a glass. Now, let's look at the two methods you mentioned, and we'll see which one is more reasonable. Method A: 1. Squeeze the juice from the fruits and mix it into the wine. Method B: 1. Chop the fruit into small pieces and add them to the wine. For a traditional sangria, Method B is more reasonable. Little pieces of fruit make the drink look more colorful and fun, and they also help add extra flavor to the sangria. When you drink it, you'll also get some yummy fruit in your glass to eat!

More on this and other local stories in Lincolnshire Lincolnshire LMC represents about 450 GPs at 100 practices across the county. Dr Sharrock, a GP in Spilsby, said: \\"We don't have access to any medical records, prescriptions, blood test or X-ray results, so if people are coming for routine appointments, for follow-ups or for a new problem which isn't urgent or an emergency, we're asking for them to postpone that.\\" The NHS has issued advice about the possibility of further cyber-attacks at GP surgeries if computers are switched on before updates are applied.

The two cities had a similar population and vehicle numbers. But I can use this background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. What is an answer for this question: Which city had more problems with carbon monoxide? The answer is:","completion":"Berg city had more problems with carbon monoxide due to the exclusive use of gasoline-powered vehicles in the city. To provide a thorough explanation for this answer, let's break down the components of the situation and the background information given. We'll then analyze why Berg city faced more issues with carbon monoxide compared to Hill city. 1. Berg city utilized only gas-powered vehicles, while Hill city used electric vehicles. Gasoline-powered vehicles rely on internal combustion engines, which burn gasoline or petrol to generate power. During this process, a number of harmful materials, such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons, are emitted as by-products. These substances pose various environmental and health concerns, including air pollution, smog formation, and respiratory problems. Conversely, electric vehicles use electricity stored in batteries to power electric motors. While electric vehicles still contribute to pollution indirectly (through the production of electricity, which might involve burning fossil fuels), they emit no tailpipe emissions, meaning they do not produce the same harmful by-products as gasoline-powered vehicles. 2. Both cities had similar population sizes and vehicle numbers. With an equal population size and a similar number of vehicles in each city, we can infer that the total emissions generated by the vehicles will be relatively proportional to the type of vehicles being used exclusively in each city. 3. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons in gasoline-powered vehicles. As mentioned in the background information, carbon monoxide is produced when hydrocarbons in gasoline are not fully combusted within a vehicle's engine. The catalytic converter in the exhaust system helps minimize the release of some of these harmful substances by converting them into less harmful products. However, despite the presence of catalytic converters, gas-powered vehicles still emit a considerable amount of carbon monoxide, which leads to various environmental and health issues. Conversely, electric vehicles do not emit any carbon monoxide from their tailpipes since they do not use an internal combustion engine. Conclusion: Given that Berg city exclusively used gas-powered vehicles, which are known for producing carbon monoxide as a by-product of combustion, it is highly likely that Berg city faced more problems with carbon monoxide in comparison to Hill city, where electric vehicles were predominantly used. The lack of tailpipe emissions from electric vehicles in Hill city attributes to a significant reduction in carbon monoxide pollution, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment for its residents."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fact 2: For example, it takes energy to boil water on the stove. Given the two facts above, how do electric stoves boil water?","completion":"To explain how electric stoves boil water, I will provide a step-by-step breakdown: 1. Connect to a power source: When an electric stove is plugged into an electrical outlet or connected to the home's electrical system, it is supplied with electrical energy. 2. Electrical energy is converted to heat energy: Electric stoves have heating elements, usually made of metal coils, that transform electrical energy into heat energy. This conversion occurs through a process called Joule heating. When electric current flows through the resistance of the metal coil, it generates heat. 3. Heat transfer through conduction: The heat produced by the metal coil is transferred to the surface of the stove. This transfer is achieved through a process called conduction, where the heat flows from the high-temperature metal coil to the cooler stove surface, equalizing the temperature difference. 4. Heating the cookware: When you place a pot or a pan containing water on the heated stove surface, the cookware absorbs the heat energy via conduction. It is essential to use cookware that is compatible with electric stoves, as the materials and design of the cookware can impact the efficiency of heat transfer. 5. Water temperature increases: As the cookware heats up, it transfers the heat energy to the water inside through conduction. The water molecules absorb this heat, causing them to move faster and increase the temperature of the water. 6. Boiling water: When the water reaches its boiling point (100°C or 212°F at sea level), it starts to vaporize. This means that the water molecules gain enough energy to break free from their liquid state and form steam. When you see bubbles forming and rising in the water, it indicates that the water has reached or is nearing its boiling point. In conclusion, electric stoves boil water by converting electrical energy into heat energy, which is transferred through conduction to the cookware and eventually to the water, raising its temperature until it boils."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds. \\"We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,\\" said professor Desai, who led the study. \\"But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.\\" Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters. The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure. \\"Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,\\" he said. \\"The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.\\" Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures.

April 1, 2006 Walter died today. Found out this morning over breakfast. Suicide. Walter. I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it. Suicide. Walter wasn't suicidal. I know that, know it for a fact. But he is dead. Why? I am not foolish enough to suspect \\"foul play\\" as they say in the mystery stories. No one cares enough about a community college art teacher to murder him. But suicide? Something is wrong here. Very wrong. April 2, 2006 I didn't realize until this morning that yesterday was April Fools day. Some kind of sick joke? But that's not like Walter either.

Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away.

Sentence from a movie review: in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, it is evident that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The negative aspects mentioned in the sentence, such as \\"failed jokes,\\" \\"twitchy acting,\\" and \\"general boorishness,\\" all indicate that the reviewer found the film to be unsuccessful in various aspects of its execution. The phrase \\"failed jokes\\" implies that the movie might have attempted to be funny or witty, but the humor did not come across effectively or was simply not amusing. This could be due to weak writing, poor direction, or ineffective timing, any of which can make the comedic elements fail to generate the intended laughter or amusement. In addition to the comedic issues, the mention of \\"twitchy acting\\" in the review suggests that the performances from the actors were subpar. It implies that the actors might have been overly expressive or unconvincing in their roles. This may have tarnished the movie's credibility or prevented the audience from connecting with the characters emotionally. If the acting appears forced or unnatural, it can significantly detract from the quality of the film and make it hard for the viewer to engage with the story. Lastly, the reviewer's mention of \\"general boorishness\\" is a broad critique of the movie's overall tone, indicating that it likely came across as rude, crude, or unpleasant. If the movie displayed an excessive crudeness in its content, tone, or presentation, it might have alienated viewers who expected a more enjoyable or thought-provoking experience. This could be a result of vulgar language, offensive themes, or objectionable behavior from the characters. General boorishness, as a criticism, can often overshadow other aspects of the film such as plot or character development, further contributing to a negative viewing experience. In conclusion, the sentence from the movie review paints a clear picture of a film that was negatively perceived by the reviewer. The combination of failed jokes, twitchy acting, and general boorishness indicates that the movie failed to engage the viewer effectively or offer an enjoyable experience. These critiques highlight the movie's main drawbacks in terms of its humor, acting, and overall tone, suggesting that it was not a well-received piece of cinema by the reviewer who penned this statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Modern criticism of Pope focuses on the man, his circumstances and motivations, prompted by theoretical perspectives such as Marxism, feminism and other forms of post-structuralism. Brean Hammond focuses on Pope's singular achievement in making an independent living solely from his writing. Laura Brown (1985) adopts a Marxist approach and accuses Pope of being an apologist for the oppressive upper classes. Hammond (1986) has studied Pope's work from the perspectives of cultural materialism and new historicism. Along Hammond's lines, Raymond Williams explains art as a set of practices influenced by broad cultural factors rather than simply the vague ideas of genius alone. Hayden Carruth, wrote that it was \\"Pope's rationalism and pandeism with which he wrote the greatest mock-epic in English literature.\\" In Politics and Poetics of Transgression (1985) Peter Stallybrass and Allon White charge that Pope drew upon the low culture which he despised in order to produce his own \\"high art\\". They assert Pope was implicated in the very material he was attempting to exclude, not dissimilar to observations made in Pope's time. Colin Nicholson reads the poetry in terms of the Financial Revolution, showing how Pope responded to the corruption of the traditional 'landed interest' by the newly dominant 'moneyed interest'. Feminists have also criticised Pope's works. Ellen Pollak's The Poetics of Sexual Myth (1985) argues that Pope followed an anti-feminist tradition, that regarded women as inferior to men both intellectually and physically. Carolyn Williams contends that a crisis in the male role during the 18th century in Britain impacted Pope and his writing.

If they’ve been opened, place the hot dogs into a plastic food storage bag that has a zipper. Make sure the hot dogs are airtight so that the cool water doesn’t touch the food. You don’t want the water to touch the hot dogs for food safety purposes. The hot dogs or the water could become contaminated, so it’s best to avoid this risk. You don’t need to be precise about temperature, but the water should feel cool to the touch. It’s generally safe to use the coolest setting on your tap. Add enough water to the bowl or dish to cover the hot dogs you want to defrost. If you're thawing multiple packs of hot dogs, it's best to place them in separate dishes so they defrost faster. Place the hot dogs into the bowl or dish and push them beneath the cool water. Make sure they’re totally covered. Leave them to sit on the counter at room temperature. Set a timer for 30 minutes so you can check on them. The hot dogs should stay at the bottom of the bowl or dish because they are heavy. However, they may float if there is air in your bag. If this happens, squeeze out the air and put your hot dogs back in the water. Pour the used water down the sink. Then, feel the hot dogs through the packaging to see if they feel thawed. If they don’t, add more cool water back to the bowl or dish. Set the timer for another 30 minutes. Thawed hot dogs should feel squishy and a little flexible. Additionally, they’ll feel cool and not cold. Your hot dogs may thaw in 30 minutes, but it’s likely that they’ll take an hour if you’re thawing a whole pack or multiple packs. After another 30 minutes, pour the used water down the sink and check your hot dogs to see if they’re thawed. When they feel thaw, start cooking them. If they still feel frozen, cover them with cool water again. Then, set your timer for 30 minutes. You can do this safely for up to 2 hours or until your hot dogs are thawed. Typically, hot dogs will defrost within 1 hour. immediately after thawing them in cool water. While this is a safer method than using your microwave, you still need to cook your hot dogs immediately. Cool water doesn’t keep the hot dogs below 40 °F (4 °C), which means that bacteria may start growing. Cook your hot dogs immediately to kill the bacteria. For instance, grill, boil, roast, or microwave your hot dogs.","completion":"The text provides a detailed process of thawing hot dogs safely and efficiently. If the hot dogs are still in their factory-sealed package, they can remain there throughout the process. However, if opened, they should be sealed in a zip-lock plastic food storage bag. The bag should be airtight to prevent cool water from coming into direct contact with the hot dogs, which could lead to contamination. The temperature of the water used isn't critical, but it should be cool to the touch. The text advises using the coolest setting on your tap. The plastic bag-enclosed hot dogs should be submerged in a bowl or dish filled with enough water to cover them completely. If defrosting multiple packs, they should be placed in separate bowls or dishes for faster defrosting. The hot dogs should be left in the water to thaw on a kitchen counter at room temperature. They must be checked after 30 minutes with the help of a timer. If the hot dogs float due to air in the bag, you should squeeze out the air and re-submerge them. After the 30 minutes, the water should be discarded. The hot dogs should then be checked to see if they have thawed. This can be done by feeling their packaging to determine if the hot dogs have become squishy and slightly flexible, while also remaining cool. If they are not thawed, you should repeat the process in another 30-minute interval. This process can be carried out safely for up to two hours or until the hot dogs are completely thawed. However, hot dogs typically defrost within an hour. Once thawed, it is important to cook the hot dogs immediately, as the water used for defrosting does not keep them below 40 °F (4 °C), a temperature at which bacteria may start to grow.

If I tell you that Phylum Platyhelminthes are mostly parasitic, and ask you the question \\"phylum Platyhelminthes are mostly what?\\", is the correct answer \\"animals\\"? Options are: a. Yes; b. No;","completion":"b. No While it is true that the Phylum Platyhelminthes belongs to the kingdom Animalia, making them animals, the question \\"Phylum Platyhelminthes are mostly what?\\" is specifically asking about their lifestyle or ecological role. In this context, the correct answer would be \\"parasitic.\\" Phylum Platyhelminthes, commonly known as flatworms, are a group of soft-bodied invertebrate animals that includes various species, such as tapeworms, flukes, and planarians. The majority of these species are parasitic, meaning they derive their nutrients by living off the resources of their host organism. This lifestyle adaptation allows them to maintain a simple body structure and often exhibit complex adaptations for finding, attaching, and exploiting their host. These adaptations can be seen in numerous specialized structures, such as hooks and suckers, which facilitate attachment to the host. Some of the best-known examples of parasitic flatworms are tapeworms (Class Cestoda), which infest vertebrates, including humans, and flukes (Class Trematoda), which infect various animals, including fish, mammals, and birds. These parasites can cause a wide range of diseases affecting their host's overall health. However, it should be noted that while most flatworms are indeed parasitic, not all of them are. Some members of the Phylum Platyhelminthes, such as planarians (Class Turbellaria), are free-living organisms that primarily inhabit freshwater environments. Planarians are primarily detritivores or predators, feeding on decomposing organic material or small organisms, respectively. In conclusion, identifying Phylum Platyhelminthes as simply \\"animals\\" may be a correct response in a broader sense, but it does not accurately address the specific aspect of their ecological role or lifestyle. As the question \\"Phylum Platyhelminthes are mostly what?\\" is seeking information about this ecological role, the correct response would be \\"parasitic.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, add the coefficients of 'h' together which gives us: (-193*h + 139*h) + 216 = 0 -54*h + 216 = 0 Next, we can find 'h' by isolating it on one side of the equation. To do this, subtract 216 from both sides of the equation: -54*h + 216 - 216 = 0 - 216 -54*h = -216 Lastly, to solve for 'h', divide both sides of the equation by -54: h = -216 / -54 So, h equals 4. Therefore, the solution to the problem \\"-193*h + 139*h + 216 = 0\\" is h = 4."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: You are given a sentence in English.

The couple have a serious argument that ends with Quint leaving.Meanwhile, in the basement of his own home, Quint's best friend, Brodie, is woken by his girlfriend, Rene.

Employee John David Welles attempts to steal rocket booster plans from the Groundstar facility. His attempt goes awry and he is badly disfigured in an explosion and barely escapes. He stumbles to the home of Nicole Devon, and collapses. She calls an ambulance, the authorities are alerted, and soon Welles is operated on, given plastic surgery and interrogated by a hard-boiled government official named Tuxan. But Welles claims to have no memory of his crime. In fact, he claims no memory of his life at all, save for brief glimpses of a woman and small boy frolicking on a beach. Despite Tuxan's brutal interrogation techniques (electro-shock and water submersion), Welles still maintains his story of total amnesia. Tuxan allows Welles to escape, hoping he will lead them to the people behind the attempted theft. Welles goes to Nicole's home and begs her to help him remember. But she knows nothing. Eventually the inside conspirators behind the attempted theft are found, and Tuxan reveals the truth to Welles, who still cannot remember any details of the crime. John David Welles actually died en route to the hospital on the night of the explosion. The man we have come to know as Welles is really Peter Bellamy, a government employee who recently lost his wife and son in an accident.

Aaliyah had a very successful recording career, singing many hits before her tragic death at age 22 in a 2001 plane crash.

Given the background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. and the situation: Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Answer the following question: Which town had more growth of algae because of fertilizer? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Big town had more growth of algae because of fertilizer. The background information provided indicates that the high application of chemicals, including fertilizers and pesticides, onto farm fields can cause significant environmental problems in nearby water bodies. When it rains, these chemicals can be picked up by water and carried by runoff into rivers or lakes. The nutrients found in fertilizers, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae, ultimately creating dead zones where nothing can live. In the given situation, Big town used pesticides and fertilizers in their agricultural practices, while Small town chose to implement permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Permaculture emphasizes the use of natural processes and organic techniques to maintain soil fertility and minimize external inputs, such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Organic farming practices also avoid synthetic chemicals, relying instead on environmentally friendly soil management practices that promote healthy ecosystems and conserve biodiversity. Given these differences in agricultural approaches, it is reasonable to conclude that Big town, which used chemical fertilizers in its farming practices, experienced a higher degree of algae growth in its local water bodies. The excessive nutrients from the chemical fertilizers are more likely to find their way into rivers and lakes, thus promoting excessive algae growth, which can negatively impact water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In contrast, Small town practiced permaculture principles and organic farming methods, significantly reducing the likelihood of chemical fertilizers causing excessive algae growth in their local water bodies. Their sustainable agricultural approach likely contributed to maintaining a more balanced and healthier ecosystem, with less risk of creating dead zones in the local water bodies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A job on an oilfield falls through due to his unwillingness to conceal a war injury on his job application, so Michael wanders into rural Red Rock, Wyoming, looking for other work. A local bar owner named Wayne mistakes him for a hit man, \\"Lyle from Dallas\\", whom Wayne has hired to kill his wife. Wayne offers him a stack of cash—\\"half now, half later\\"—and Michael plays along by taking the money. Michael visits Wayne's wife, Suzanne and attempts to warn her that her life is in danger instead of killing her. She offers him more money to kill Wayne. Michael tries to leave town but a car accident leads him to encounter the local sheriff, who turns out to be Wayne. Michael manages to escape from Wayne but runs into the real Lyle from Dallas. Lyle and Wayne quickly figure out what has transpired, while Michael desperately tries to warn Suzanne before Lyle finds her. The next morning, when Lyle comes to get money from Wayne, he kidnaps both Suzanne and Michael, who are trying to retrieve hidden cash from Wayne's office. Wayne and Suzanne are revealed to be wanted for embezzlement and Wayne is arrested by his own deputies. Lyle returns with Michael and Suzanne hostage and gets Wayne out of jail to retrieve their stash of money. At a remote graveyard, Wayne pulls a gun from the case of money and holds Lyle at gunpoint before Lyle throws a knife into Wayne's neck. Michael and Lyle fight, with Lyle ending up being impaled on a grave marker. When Lyle rises to attack Michael, Suzanne shoots him dead. Michael and Suzanne escape onto a nearby train, but when Suzanne tries to betray Michael, he throws the money out of the speeding train and then throws Suzanne off to be arrested by the police accompanied by a wounded Wayne. Michael's train continues its journey into a new town. contains an answer for the question: Who does the person that the drifter warns want him to kill?, what is it ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. – A chance glance and a big toe saved a 22-year-old woman's life in the UK, the London Times reports. Sam Hemming, a law school graduate of North Wales' Bangor University, was being driven home to Hereford by her boyfriend, Tom Curtis, in July when they got into an accident, per the Mirror: The car flipped, and while Curtis wasn't badly hurt, Hemming was left with broken neck bones, a fractured arm, and severe head injuries, leading doctors to place her in a medically induced coma, the Sun notes. After 19 days, the doctors said hope was gone, and Hemming's family gathered to say their goodbyes. Doctors said they'd switch her life support off and on three times before turning it off for good, just to make sure there was no brain activity—and as they prepared to switch it off for the final time, a medic brushed against her big toe with an icy-cold wipe and her toe wiggled. Doctors gave her a tracheotomy, and a few days later when they turned the life support off again, she could breathe on her own. The second part of Hemming's story: Doctors didn't think she'd ever walk or talk again, though now she's doing both as she recuperates at her parents' home. Even though Hemming suffers from PTSD and has memory loss, doctors are hopeful they can keep boosting her brain function, per the Hereford Times. \\"When I look at the pictures of me in the coma, it seems unreal,\\" Hemming says. \\"And when I hear that my toe saved me, it's amazing.\\" (A college student in a coma gave his mom a Christmas \\"miracle.\\") Expand this summary.","completion":"Sure kiddo, let me explain this to you. So, there was a girl named Sam Hemming. She was really smart and had just finished law school in a place called North Wales, which is in the United Kingdom. She was going home with her boyfriend, Tom Curtis. But, oh no, they had an accident! The car they were in flipped over. Tom was okay, but Sam was badly hurt. She had broken bones in her neck and her arm. She also hurt her head very badly. Because she was so hurt, the doctors had to make her sleep for a while. This is called a medically induced coma. After 19 days, the doctors told Sam's family to come and say goodbye. This was because they thought Sam was not going to wake up again. They had a machine helping her to breathe, but they didn’t see any signs that her brain was still working. Before turning off the machine for good, the doctors switched it off and on three times to double-check. Just as they were about to turn it off for the final time, something amazing happened. A doctor was touching her big toe with a really cold cloth when her toe moved! This showed that there was still some life left in Sam. The doctors then made a small hole in her throat to help her breathe. This is called a tracheotomy. When they turned off the breathing machine a few days later, she could breathe by herself! But the story didn't end there. The doctors thought Sam would never be able to walk or talk again, but guess what? She proved them wrong! She's back in her parents' house now, walking and talking while she gets better. Even though she still gets scared because of what happened (that's called PTSD) and sometimes forgets things, the doctors think they can continue to help her brain get better. Sam said it's really amazing to think how her big toe saved her life! Just like a superhero toe! Pretty cool story, right?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Q:Dara and Jody sat on the sun-scorched concrete with their backs against the bus shelter. They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool. Jody had done it not in the hope of getting attention, because no one was paying attention, they were all packing up their own crap as fast as possible; she'd just done it.

Paragraph: Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Summarize this article: It may soon be possible to obtain a highly accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by analyzing a sample of spinal fluid. A study released Monday found that a constellation of three substances in the cerebrospinal fluid was present in 90% of people who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.The test also showed the same markers were found in 72% of people with mild cognitive impairment, considered an early stage of the disease, and in one-third of adults who had no cognitive problems.Many experts believe that biomarkers in spinal fluid may emerge as the most accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. At present, the disease is diagnosed using pencil-and-paper cognitive tests, which are subjective and may be inaccurate. The diagnosis can only be confirmed by examining brain tissue at an autopsy.Researchers from Belgium analysed 114 older adults who were cognitively normal, 200 who had mild cognitive impairment and 102 who had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. They looked for three specific biomarkers, proteins that develop in the brain when the disease is present. A later analysis looking at brain autopsies for confirmation found the test of spinal fluid markers was correct in 64 of 68 cases.The fact that Alzheimer's was diagnosed in about one-third of people without symptoms of the disease means that the disease process is underway well before symptoms occur, the authors said.In an editorial accompanying the paper, two U.S. experts in the disease said that cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be put into wider practice. \\"There is now ample evidence that these measurements have value; physicians need to formulate when and how to incorporate cerebrospinal fluid measurements into practice,\\" they wrote.The use of such tests will become even more important once drugs are developed to stop or slow the progression of the disease. Ideally, experts say, people could begin taking the medications before any sign of symptoms if cerebrospinal fluid markers are positive for the disease.The study was released Monday in the Archives of Neurology -- Shari RoanReturn to Booster Shots blog ||||| Researchers report that a spinal fluid test can be 100 percent accurate in in identifying a signature level of abnormal proteins in patients with significant memory loss who went on to develop Alzheimer’s disease . Although there has been increasing evidence of the value of this and other tests in finding signs of Alzheimer’s, the study, which will appear Tuesday in the Archives of Neurology, shows how accurate they can be. The new result is one of a number of remarkable recent findings about Alzheimer’s. After decades when nothing much seemed to be happening, when this progressive brain disease seemed untreatable and when its diagnosis could be confirmed only at autopsy, the field has suddenly woken up. Alzheimer’s, medical experts now agree, starts a decade or more before people have symptoms. And by the time there are symptoms, it may be too late to save the brain. So the hope is to find good ways to identify people who are getting the disease, and use those people as subjects in studies to see how long it takes for symptoms to occur and in studies of drugs that may slow or stop the disease. Researchers are finding simple and accurate ways to detect Alzheimer’s long before there are definite symptoms. In addition to spinal fluid tests they also have new PET scans of the brain that show the telltale amyloid plaques that are a unique feature of the disease. And they are testing hundreds of new drugs that, they hope, might change the course of the relentless brain cell death that robs people of their memories and abilities to think and reason. “This is what everyone is looking for, the bull’s-eye of perfect predictive accuracy,” Dr. Steven DeKosky, dean of the University of Virginia medical school, who is not connected to the new research, said about the spinal tap study. Dr. John Morris, a professor of neurology at Washington University, said the new study “establishes that there is a signature of Alzheimer’s and that it means something. It is very powerful.” A lot of work lies ahead, researchers say — making sure the tests are reliable if they are used in doctors’ offices, making sure the research findings hold up in real-life situations, getting doctors and patients comfortable with the notion of spinal taps, the method used to get spinal fluid. But they see a bright future. Although the latest PET scans for Alzheimer’s are not commercially available, the spinal fluid tests are. So the new results also give rise to a difficult question: Should doctors offer, or patients accept, commercially available spinal tap tests to find a disease that is yet untreatable? In the research studies, patients are often not told they may have the disease, but in practice in the real world, many may be told. Some medical experts say it should be up to doctors and their patients. Others say doctors should refrain from using the spinal fluid test in their practices. They note that it is not reliable enough — results can vary by lab — and has been studied only in research settings where patients are carefully selected to have no other conditions, like strokes or depression, that could affect their memories. “This is literally on the cutting edge of where the field is,” Dr. DeKosky said. “The field is moving fast. You can get a test that is approved by the F.D.A., and cutting edge doctors will use it.” But, said Dr. John Trojanowski, a University of Pennsylvania researcher and senior author of the paper, given that people can get the test now, “How early do you want to label people?” Some, like Dr. John Growdon, a neurology professor at Massachusetts General Hospital who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper, said that decision was up to doctors and their patients. Sometimes patients with severe memory loss do not have the disease. Doctors might want to use the test in cases where they want to be sure of the diagnosis. And they might want to offer the test to people with milder symptoms who want to know whether they are developing the devastating brain disease. One drawback, though, is that spinal fluid is obtained with a spinal tap, and that procedure, with its reputation for pain and headaches, makes most doctors and many patients nervous. The procedure involves putting a needle in the spinal space and withdrawing a small amount of fluid. Dr. Growdon and others say spinal taps are safe and not particularly painful for most people. But, he said, there needs to be an education campaign to make people feel more comfortable about having them. He suggested that, because most family doctors and internists are not experienced with the test, there could be special spinal tap centers where they could send patients. The new study included more than 300 patients in their 70s, 114 with normal memories, 200 with memory problems and 102 with Alzheimer’s disease. Their spinal fluid was analyzed for amyloid beta, a protein fragment that forms plaques in the brain, and for tau, a protein that accumulates in dead and dying nerve cells in the brain. To avoid bias, the researchers analyzing the data did not know anything about the clinical status of the subjects. Also, the subjects were not told what the tests showed. Nearly every person with Alzheimer’s had the characteristic spinal fluid protein levels. Nearly three quarters of people with mild cognitive impairment, a memory impediment that can precede Alzheimer’s, had Alzheimer’s-like spinal fluid proteins. And about a third of people with normal memories had spinal fluid indicating Alzheimer’s. Researchers suspect that those people will develop memory problems. In checking their findings against data gathered in a separate study, the researchers found that among 57 patients with mild cognitive impairment who went on to develop Alzheimer’s within five years, 100 percent had the characteristic protein levels five years before. The prevailing hypothesis about Alzheimer’s says that amyloid and tau accumulation are necessary for the disease and that stopping the proteins could stop the disease. But it is not yet known what happens when these proteins accumulate in the brains of people with normal memories. They might be a risk factor like high cholesterol levels. Many people with high cholesterol levels never have heart attacks. Or it might mean that Alzheimer’s has already started and if the person lives long enough he or she will with absolute certainty get symptoms like memory loss. Many, like Dr. DeKosky, believe that when PET scans for amyloid become available, they will be used instead of spinal taps, in part because doctors and patients are more comfortable with brain scans. And when — researchers optimistically are saying “when” these days — drugs are shown to slow or prevent the disease, the thought is that people will start having brain scans or spinal taps for Alzheimer’s as routinely as they might have colonoscopies or mammograms today. For now, Dr. DeKosky said, the days when Alzheimer’s could be confirmed only at autopsy are almost over. And the time when Alzheimer’s could be detected only after most of the brain damage was done seem to be ending, too. “The new biomarkers in CSF have made the difference,” Dr. DeKosky said, referring to cerebral spinal fluid. “This confirms their accuracy in a very big way.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"A recent study suggests that analyzing a sample of spinal fluid could provide a highly accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, detecting the presence of three substances found in the cerebrospinal fluid in 90% of diagnosed patients.

The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform. - The is an 8-bit handheld game console released by Sega on October 6, 1990 in Japan, in North America and Europe, and Australia in 1992. The Game Gear primarily competed with Nintendo's Game Boy, the Atari Lynx and NEC's TurboExpress. The handheld shares much of its hardware with the Master System and is able to play its own titles as well as those of the Master System, the latter being made possible by the use of an adapter. Containing a full-color backlit screen with a landscape format, Sega positioned the Game Gear as a technologically superior handheld to the Game Boy. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - The PlayStation 2 (abbreviated as PS2) is a home video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the successor to the PlayStation, and is the second installment in the PlayStation lineup of consoles. It was released on March 4, 2000 in Japan, October 26, 2000 in North America, November 24, 2000 in Europe, and November 17, 2000 in Australia. It competed with Sega's Dreamcast, Microsoft's Xbox, and Nintendo's GameCube in the sixth generation of video game consoles. - The is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27, 1998 in Japan, September 9, 1999 in North America, and October 14, 1999 in Europe. It was the first in the sixth generation of video game consoles, preceding Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox. The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console, marking the end of the company's 18 years in the console market. - The (abbreviated as GBA) is a 32-bit handheld video game console developed, manufactured and marketed by Nintendo as the successor to the Game Boy Color. It was released in Japan on March 21, 2001, in North America on June 11, 2001, in Australia and Europe on June 22, 2001, and in the People's Republic of China on June 8, 2004 (excluding Hong Kong). Nintendo's competitors in the handheld market at the time were the Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan, GP32, Tapwave Zodiac, and the N-Gage. Despite the competitors' best efforts, Nintendo maintained a majority market share with the Game Boy Advance. As of June 30, 2010, the Game Boy Advance series has sold 81.51 million units worldwide. Its successor, the Nintendo DS, was released in November 2004 and is also compatible with Game Boy Advance software. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - The , referred to as GBC, is a handheld game console manufactured by Nintendo, which was released on October 21, 1998 in Japan and was released in November of the same year in international markets. It is the successor of the Game Boy. - The , stylized as NINTENDO and often referred to as N64, is Nintendo's third home video game console for the international market. Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, September 1997 in France and December 1997 in Brazil. It is the industry's last major successive home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format, as all succeeding home consoles up until the Nintendo Switch used an optical format. In addition, current handheld systems (such as the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS) also use cartridges. While the Nintendo 64 was succeeded by Nintendo's MiniDVD-based GameCube in November 2001, the consoles remained available until the system was retired in late 2003. - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost. - The is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System and released in 1986 in North America, 1987 in Europe, and 1989 in Brazil. The redesigned Master System was also released in Japan in 1987. Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges (or \\"Mega Cartridges\\", as they were officially called) and the credit card-sized Sega Cards, which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity; the Master System II and later models did not have the card slot. The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games. - The is an 8-bit handheld video game device with interchangeable cartridges developed and manufactured by Nintendo, which was first released in Japan on , in North America on and in Europe on .

Write a title for this article: PEEBLES, Scotland (Aug. 23) -- Robert Mackie trembles with rage when he describes how he and his wife were kept in the dark about his HIV infection -- and how doctors published his medical data in journals years before they gave him the devastating news. Mackie is one of some 5,700 British hemophiliacs who received tainted blood and were infected with HIV, hepatitis or both, in what has been viewed as one of the worst treatment disasters in the history of Britain's heath care system. Nearly a third of those infected have since died. Robert Mackie, 58, learned he had HIV in 1987 but said he has medical records showing he was used for an AIDS study several years before then. Tainted blood scandals have been investigated throughout the world — in France, Canada, Japan and elsewhere — leading to some convictions of health officials and many compensation packages for infected hemophiliacs, but there has been no detailed probe in Britain until now. One inquiry under way will likely end in a nonbinding report, while the other is an official investigation by the Scottish government that could lead to charges filed against individuals. \\"They used me as a guinea pig,\\" said Mackie, 58, in his house in Scotland. \\"It's just a miracle my wife wasn't infected.\\" Hemophiliacs suffer from an inherited disorder that prevents blood from clotting. Mackie — an active sportsman who had hoped to become a salmon fishing guide — had controlled his hemophilia with a treatment called cryoprecipitate when he switched in 1980 to a new product. Called Factor VIII, it was supposed to be more effective in helping his blood clot. In 1983, he heard hemophiliacs were developing AIDS, then a mysterious disease that usually claimed its victims in two or three years. He said he asked his doctors if he could be exposed to the killer virus through his use of Factor VIII, a relatively new blood plasma product made from blood collected from thousands of donors. They told him not to worry. A year later, he was infected by a contaminated batch. \\"We could have had more of a family,\\" says Alice Mackie, who had a son with Robert before he became infected. \\"The two of us had plans for what we were going to do. But you could say our whole lives stopped.\\" The tainted blood led to the deaths of Mackie's cousin, two uncles and friends, who were part of a close-knit community of hemophiliacs in Scotland. \\"From '87, all we saw was people dying,\\" said Alice, her hair white at 51. \\"And believe me, when you see someone dying of AIDS, it's really bad. It's different each time. No one dies the same way.\\" Mackie said he was told of his infection in 1987. But he told an independent inquiry commission that when he finally obtained his medical records, he learned he had been used for an AIDS study that began several years before then. \\"This AIDS study was, it seems, the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent,\\" he told the inquiry committee headed by Lord Archer, a former solicitor general. Factor VIII was meant to thicken blood so that it would clot properly, and Mackie was told it was a breakthrough when he got his first treatment in 1980. But the risks were high. With each dose, blood plasma from thousands of donors was introduced into his system. Between 2,500 to 22,000 donors contributed to each batch of Factor VIII, which could then treat about 100 patients. The contamination risk increased as the number of donors grew, but it was only once AIDS emerged as a global public health threat that doctors learned how great that risk was. By 1983, U.S. medical experts had established that AIDS — previously concentrated among gay men — was striking hemophiliacs. In April 1983, an American doctor wrote in The Lancet medical journal asking for data on hemophiliacs in areas where there was no reported HIV in the blood donor community. The journal published a response one month later — from Mackie's physician, Dr. Christopher Ludlam. In the letter, published on May 28, 1983, Ludlam described his own patients as a valuable resource for further study because Scotland produced its own Factor VIII and seemed to have an AIDS-free donor community. Mackie said that in 1985 — when he was already infected but didn't know it — Ludlam wrote to government authorities seeking ethics approval to study the immune system of infected patients and claimed that his patients knew about the research and had agreed to participate. \\"If, as the ethics application form states, consent was obtained from all subjects ... how is it that I did not know about my AIDS status until 1987?\\" he said at the hearing. \\"I did not know anything about his studies or research.\\" Mackie obtained copies of the form submitted by Ludlam in which the doctor says his patients were well informed about his studies. Ludlam, who practices at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, declined to talk with The Associated Press about the case. Brian Montgomery, a National Health Service executive who oversees the hospital, said it would be \\"inappropriate\\" to comment while the inquiries are ongoing. Two of Mackie's uncles and a cousin were also hemophiliacs under Ludlam's care. They learned they had been infected around the same time. All three succumbed fairly quickly. The family held three funerals in two years. Mackie was convinced he would be next. Surprisingly, he stayed relatively healthy for a decade. He thought he had escaped a death sentence, but in 1997 his appetite began to wane. By 2000, he had advanced symptoms of AIDS. He became too weak to climb stairs. The smell of food sickened him. Doctors said he had a few weeks left, but he was too stubborn, and too suspicious about doctors, to take the new anti-retroviral drugs that were by then extending the lives of many AIDS patients. For days he sat, feverish, in his kitchen, believing death was imminent. Then, drawing on reserves he did not know he possessed, his fighting spirit returned. He gave in to Alice's pleas and started to take the new drugs after she convinced him they were not poison. The drugs worked. Mackie said they at first caused a dangerous reaction that left him \\"out of his head\\" but eventually gave him more energy and confidence. Despite being weak from AIDS and Hepatitis C, which he found out he had in 2000, Mackie insisted on giving evidence to the Archer committee last year. The hearings were closed to the public but a report is expected next month. Alice read most of his statement, and he spoke quietly when he spoke at all, but he did raise his voice at one point to tell the committee that doctors had endangered the safety of his wife and son by holding back his HIV status. \\"I believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country,\\" he said, voice booming again. \\"We were all used as lab rats.\\" The Mackies say they are not expecting much from the new investigations. But Andrew March, a hemophiliac in London who became HIV positive when he was nine after exposure to tainted blood plasma products, said the surviving victims want the truth to finally be told. \\"I feel anger a lot of the time,\\" said March, who is now 34 and generally free of AIDS symptoms. \\"Frustration. A sense of being repeatedly betrayed. There are lessons to be learned that haven't been learned yet.\\" He said the slightest cold makes him wonder how long his immune system will be able to fight off illnesses. Christopher James, chief executive of the Haemophilia Society, said a generation of hemophiliacs was exposed to HIV and Hepatitis C. He said doctors had an obligation to tell Mackie, and other victims, that they were HIV positive so they could take steps to protect their partners. \\"There was a very high death rate,\\" said James, who hopes the inquiries will lead to a financial settlement for the victims as well as a public apology. \\"These people have faced enormous financial and emotional hardships from this catastrophe and they deserve to know what happened and why and to be sure it will never happen again.\\"","completion":"Title: \\"Hidden Truths: Hemophiliacs, Tainted Blood, and Unwanted Experiments in Britain\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A mother has told of her shock after her family-of-five had a chat with President Obama during a trip to Stonehenge - but that she now wishes she had invited him back for coffee. Inspired by rumours that the President's helicopter had landed at the ancient site, Janice Raffle and her husband James marched across fields with their three sons in the hope they would catch a glimpse of the US President. At first the family, who live a mile from the monument, were stuck at a fence. But a good-natured Obama wandered over to where they were standing - and even agreed to pose for a family photo. Landmark:","completion":"The Raffle family had been living just a mile away from the famous Stonehenge monument and thought they might be able to get a glimpse of President Obama as the rumors of his helicopter landing nearby spread throughout the local community. Armed with both excitement and determination, Janice, her husband James, and their three sons embarked on a spontaneous adventure, marching across the fields with the hope of seeing the US President in person. Initially, the family found themselves halted by a fence, unable to move any closer to the historical monument. They stood there, peering over the obstacles, when the unbelievable happened. To their absolute astonishment and delight, President Obama, with his trademark smile and warmth, approached the family himself. It seemed like fate was on their side, as the President crossed paths with this ordinary family during his visit to the world heritage site. Displaying his genuine and good-natured personality, Obama took some time out from his busy schedule to chat with the family. The Raffles, though utterly surprised, were thrilled to engage in conversation with the President. As they enjoyed this unexpected and once-in-a-lifetime encounter, the idea of capturing the moment struck them. Mustering their courage, they asked President Obama if he would be willing to pose for a family photo. Much to their amazement, the President graciously agreed, and the family quickly gathered around him, all smiles. The photograph, which would undoubtedly become a cherished family treasure, was taken with the legendary Stonehenge as a backdrop. The interaction between the Raffle family and President Obama perfectly captured the essence of humanity, transcending political boundaries and nationalities. As the conversation came to an end, and with the image of President Obama and the Raffle family immortalized, everyone bid their farewells. However, it was only after the astonishing encounter that Janice Raffle was struck with a pang of regret. She wished that she had extended an invitation to President Obama for a cup of coffee at their nearby home. Although the opportunity to invite the President for a more personal and informal visit slipped through their fingers, the Raffle family would always fondly remember the day when they shared a once-in-a-lifetime, heartwarming experience with the then-serving President of the United States. And while Janice may forever wonder about the missed possibility of inviting him back for coffee, the family would cherish that impromptu rendezvous at Stonehenge, which transformed an ordinary day into an extraordinary memory they would carry with them for the rest of their lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which group's cans had the air molecules inside move slower? A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first. Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.","completion":"Based on the provided paragraph and the principles of the kinetic-molecular theory, Group George's cans had the air molecules inside move slower compared to Group Jones' cans. This is because Group George vented their cans before heating them, which allowed for the release of the increasing pressure inside the cans as the air molecules gained kinetic energy due to the heat from the campfire. By venting the cans, Group George minimized the chances of an explosion by preventing a rapid increase in internal pressure. Since the pressure was allowed to escape, the air molecules inside Group George's cans did not need to move as fast or impact the container walls with as much force compared to Group Jones' cans. On the other hand, Group Jones did not vent their cans, which led to a rapid buildup of pressure as the air molecules gained kinetic energy from the campfire heat. This increased molecular movement and force against the container walls eventually caused the cans to explode. Therefore, the air molecules inside Group Jones' cans moved at a faster pace as a result of the increasing pressure and temperature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Kissing\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is associated with positive emotions, shared experiences, and romantic gestures. In the context of a couple at the end of a sleighing ride, it is natural for the couple to express affection and share a special moment together, such as a kiss. The other possible answers do not align with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Decline: This term usually implies a decrease in something or a turning down of an offer. It doesn't fit well in the context of sharing a happy experience on a sleigh ride. 2. Going down hill: This phrase can mean both the literal physical descent on a hill, as well as a metaphorical decline or deterioration. In the context of a couple on a sleighing ride, neither meaning seems to be a suitable or positive way to end the experience. 3. Nausea: While this option refers to physical discomfort, it is not directly related to sleigh rides and is not a happy way to end a sleigh ride or connect with a partner. It is also not what a couple would typically associate with an enjoyable winter activity. 4. Death: This option is grim and morbid. It does not align with human common sense in the context of a romantic, enjoyable activity like a sleigh ride.

Verdant vineyards and happy harvesters bring to mind the pleasures of sniffing, swirling and quaffing wine. We've been led to believe that the best wines require a long time -- often several years -- in barrels (and then in bottles) to reach maturity and \\"drinkability.\\" As for grape spirits, generically known as brandies, it's a multi-billion dollar market worldwide. You distill the wine (and the pressed skins) to get the raw brandy, which is almost undrinkable in its early life. Before it's even palatable, to shave off the raw edges, it needs to mature. Typically, this is done in oak barrels, where, over time, the spirits pick up color and concentration. Now a research team in Spain says a lot of that romance isn't necessary. Brandies can age just as well when they're zapped with ultrasound waves. The Spanish experiments, which seem promising, were first reported in the science magazine Discover. A number of techniques have long been in the cellar master's toolkit. A stainless steel fermenting tank can be lined with oak staves; oak chips and oak extracts are often used to enhance the \\"buttery\\" flavor of young white wines; so-called \\"micro-oxygenation\\" introduces imperceptibly tiny bubbles in young red wines to accelerate their maturation. For spirits, which emerge from the still perfectly clear, it's not unheard of to use artificial coloring agents to bypass the years-long process of evaporation through the pores of oak barrels. And there are home remedies, too: magnets that supposedly realign the molecules, and a variety of whirlers and twirlers that purport to add (or remove) oxygen. They share only only thing: ineffectiveness. The best brandy is from the Cognac region in southwestern France. By law, it must be aged for a minimum of two years, and many are aged for ten years or more. But it's an expensive process, hence the drive to find less costly methods. Ultrasound exams, a common medical procedure these days (to see unborn infants in the womb, for example), use high-frequency pressure waves. In commercial uses, ultrasound waves can actually cause tissues to rupture and release compounds stored within cells. ||||| For many liquors, aging is the key to their distinct flavors. Brandy is no exception, with top-shelf labels spending years in casks. But chemists think they have discovered a shortcut—ultrasound. Spanish researchers shot a river of brandy through a bed of American oak chips and blasted the mix with ultrasound for three days. They also altered a slate of variables, including temperature, amount of oak chips, alcoholic strength of the liquor, aeration, and more. The team then ran the results past a panel of experts, asking them to rate the quality of the different liquors. Ultrasound appears to dramatically accelerate the aging process. While not quite up to the standards of a truly-aged brandy, the ultrasonic spirits were still well received. Here’s Charles Q. Choi, reporting for Discover: “Obtaining, in three days, a spirit with characteristics near to two-years-aged brandies was something really unexpected for us,” says study co-author Valme García, a professor at the University of Cádiz in Spain. Eight trained judges, including some of the researchers, deemed the resulting spirits nearly as good as traditional brandies. “They tasted surprisingly well, with good fruity and sweet flavors and a high aromatic intensity,” García said. The best brandy produced in this experiment was stiff—130 proof, or 65% alcohol—and run past a large number of oak chips at room temperature with a bit of aeration. The accelerated aging is brought about thanks to ultrasound-induced cavitation in the oak chips, where small bubbles formed by the sound waves “explosively collapse,” blasting the wood’s tissues and releasing compounds that add distinctive flavors to the liquor. Booze experts call these “congeners.” While the liquor produced by the accelerated aging process can’t legally be called brandy in Europe since regulations require that the spirit be aged in oak casks, Gargía pointed out that the technique could be used to help distillers accelerate their development process. Want to know how a new cooper’s casks will affect the flavor? Add ultrasound. What about a different species of wood? Again, ultrasound could help. Beyond that, more adventurous distillers may gin up entirely new alcoholic beverages with unusual flavors. For García, wine is next on the list. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Spanish researchers have discovered that using ultrasound waves can accelerate the aging process of brandy, significantly reducing the time it takes to achieve a mature taste. By running brandy through a bed of oak chips while applying ultrasound for three days, they were able to create a spirit with characteristics resembling that of traditionally barrel-aged brandies. The process involves ultrasound-induced cavitation in oak chips, which releases compounds that add the distinctive flavors to the liquor.

But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation.

Question: What sentence does Grandier get? Movie title: The Devils Movie plot: In 17th Century France, Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Logue) is influencing King Louis XIII (Graham Armitage) in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from uprising. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its governor not to damage the town.Meanwhile in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier (Oliver Reed), a dissolute and proud but popular and well-regarded Catholic priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Mignon (Murray Melvin), another priest in the town, unaware that the deformed, neurotic Sister Jeanne (Vanessa Redgrave), head of the local convent, is sexually obsessed with him. She asks for Grandier to become the convent's new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeline De Brou (Gemma Jones), but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, driving her to insanity (this includes an attack where Sister Jeanne viciously attacks Madeleine when the latter brings back a book that the former had lent her, and Sister Jeanne accuses Madeleine of being a \\"fornicator\\" and \\"sacrilegious bitch\\", among other things).Baron de Laubardemont (Dudley Sutton) arrives with orders to demolish the city, overriding Grandier's orders to stop. Grandier summons the town's soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be her new confessor. She informs him of Grandier's marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her. Mignon relays this information to Laubardemont.

Beyoncé recorded the song in May 2008 at the Boom Boom Room Studio in Burbank, California, and it was mixed by Jaycen Joshua and Dave Pensado, with assistance from Randy Urbanski and Andrew Wuepper. Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio.

Answer the question: Compared to a 350 foot tall ocean tsunami, would a one inch ripple in a pond have more energy or less energy?? Answer:","completion":"A one-inch ripple in a pond would have significantly less energy than a 350-foot tall ocean tsunami. The energy of a wave is proportional to its height (amplitude), the square of its frequency (how often waves pass a certain point in a certain time), and the square of its wavelength (the distance between successive waves). A 350-foot tall ocean tsunami is incredibly larger in terms of these parameters, and thus carries a massive amount of energy compared to a one-inch ripple in a pond, which is relatively tiny in size and frequency. Therefore, the tsunami would have much more destructive power upon impact. This is why tsunamis can pose major threats to coastal areas, causing widespread destruction, while tiny pond ripples pose no threat."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Sir Alex Ferguson is expected to have little or no say in who will be the next manager of Manchester United. The 72-year-old former United boss, who won 38 trophies in 26 seasons at Old Trafford, was effectively handed full authority to choose his successor after announcing his own retiremment last season. His choice, David Moyes, was fired today after an early mornning meeting with United chief executive at United's Carrington training HQ. Not this time, Sir ALex: Ferguson, who will not appoint Davuid Moyes' successor, checks his watch as he takes in a the match against Bayern Munich in this season's Champions League. No hiding place: Ryan Giggs (left) has been appointed interim manager at United following the sacking of David Moyes (right) The United hierarchy’s explanation for allowing Ferguson to effectively select his successor was that it made sense to trust the judgement of someone with so much success and who was still on the payroll as a £2million-a-year ambassador. United's board clearly remain keen to maintain links with the Ferguson era, however, as they have appointed Ryan Giggs as interim manager, with Nicky Butt his assistant. Sportsmail understands that Phil Neville remains part of the back-room set up despite Moyes' departure. The club are also intent on luring Paul Scholes back in to the Old Trafford fold after the departure of Moyes, as revealed by Sportsmail earlier today. Scholes has hardly been seen at the club since doing some work with Under 19s manager Nicky Butt earlier this season after becoming disillusioned with what he felt were half-hearted attempts by Moyes to find him a role. Now that Moyes has been sacked as United. manager, the club will do everything they can to fit their former. midfield player in to their coaching set-up as they look to retain a. connection with the club’s glorious past behind the scenes. With United set to appoint a foreign manager to replace Moyes the club are concerned that ties with the past could be cut. Ryan Giggs is now the club interim manager and will be retained whatever happens this summer but Phil Neville could follow Moyes out of the club after serving as a coach under the Scot while brother Gary and David Beckham are pursuing other careers. United had no plans in place to reintroduce Scholes to the coaching staff while Moyes was in charge and a source close to the club revealed to Sportsmail last month that the situation was unlikely to change. Scholes teamed up with Butt to help his former team-mate coach the United youngsters for the UEFA youth league in the autumn but this arrangement was on a purely voluntary, non-contracted basis. It was orchestrated by Butt, rather than Moyes, and it remained a temporary role. Last summer, Scholes turned down the chance to play a leading role on Moyes' staff, citing a wish to spend some time with his family before making his return to football.

Here is a premise: In the narrow streets lined with merchants' and tailors' shops, the Star of David, menorahs, and Jewish names are actually more plentiful than Jewish people themselves. Here is a hypothesis: The businesses are not authentically Jewish. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"It is not definitively possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Just based on this limited information provided in the premise and the hypothesis, there are alternative explanations to consider, as well as context in which the scenario could be understood. Here is a thorough analysis of the matter: 1. Authenticity: The hypothesis suggests that the businesses are not authentically Jewish, which may imply that the usage of Jewish symbols and names is purely for business purposes or appropriation. However, the presence of the Star of David, menorahs, and Jewish names might be because the business owners or staff have Jewish ancestry or connections with the community, even if they might not be directly practicing Judaism. 2. Demographics: The premise indicates that Jewish symbols and names are more plentiful than Jewish people themselves in the area. This can mean that a significant Jewish community previously lived here and left a lasting cultural and business influence on the area. The current population might have changed, but the history and traditions remained, thereby not necessarily disqualifying the businesses being considered as authentically Jewish. 3. Business Ownership: It is also essential to delve into the question of business ownership. The businesses might have been established by Jewish owners who migrated or moved away, leaving the businesses in the hands of their successors, who might not be Jewish. It is possible that the Jewish spirit of the businesses is intact, albeit with a new generation of non-Jewish owners. The usage of Jewish symbols and names might be a way of continuing tradition and respecting the origins of the businesses. 4. Cultural and Historical Context: The presence of Jewish symbols and names could also be interpreted as homage or respect to the history and culture of a particular location – the streets might be known to have a historical Jewish influence or connection. In this case, the hypothesis that the businesses are not authentically Jewish might not necessarily be true because the businesses could be promoting the cultural heritage of the area, regardless of the number of Jewish individuals currently residing there. In conclusion, while the hypothesis might have some validity, it is not possible to definitively conclude that it is true based solely on the premise provided. A more comprehensive understanding of the area's history, demographics, and cultural context would be required to draw a more accurate conclusion regarding the authenticity of these businesses being Jewish or not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mystery: Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981. The family of a little girl who disappeared more than 30 years ago have spoken of their devastation after David Cameron ruled out any further investigation of the mystery. Katrice Lee was only two when she went missing from a British Army base in Germany in 1981. Her parents believe military police made mistakes in the early stages of their investigation into her disappearance - but the Prime Minister has resisted calls to reopen the inquiry. Katrice's father, Richard Lee, 62, today appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family to explain why the case will not be taken forward. Mr Lee, who lives in Hartlepool, County Durham, said: 'I want to meet up with the Prime Minister and I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why he isn't looking into the case any further. 'He said he was going to and then he met up with the military police, but why hasn't he asked to meet up with us and get our side?' Mr Cameron promised to look into the case last month when Tory MP Caroline Dinenage raised it during Prime Minister's Questions. Waiting for answers: Katrice's father, Richard Lee, has appealed to Mr Cameron to meet the family and explain why the case will not be taken forward. But Ms Dinenage, the local MP for Katrice's mother, Sharon, of Gosport, Hampshire, received a letter from Mr Cameron stating that the case would not be reinvestigated. Refusal: Mr Cameron was urged to look into the case by Tory MP Caroline Dinenage. Mr Cameron wrote that he had reached the decision following a meeting with military police. It is another blow for Katrice's family, who have campaigned for three decades for police to release their files on the case. They claim military police have been uncooperative over the years and that mistakes were made in the hours after Katrice was reported missing. Mr Lee said: 'Things weren't done that should have been done 30 years ago and now the people who are working in the office with the Prime Minister are people who were never there in the beginning. 'Who better to speak to than us, Katrice's family?' Mr Lee has been working with Hartlepool MP Iain Wright to push for progress in the case. He said: 'I'm not going to let this issue go away.

As I watched this film I felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s. However, then I find out that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools. Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise 200,000. So the seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you raise 200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in?

Process: - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body. Question: suppose a person is feeling breathless happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If a person is feeling breathless, this could lead to LESS oxygen being brought to the body. Here's how the perturbation would influence the second effect mentioned, which is the diaphragm and other muscles expanding to allow room for the lungs to fill: When a person experiences breathlessness, it is often due to difficulties in the breathing process. This can be caused by various factors such as asthma, lung diseases, or even anxiety. As a result, the diaphragm and other muscles involved in the breathing process might not be able to expand enough to create adequate space for the lungs to fill with air. When this happens, the amount of oxygen entering the system becomes limited. This limitation in oxygen intake will cause a chain reaction that affects the rest of the process: 1. The air flowing into the narrow bronchioles would be reduced, leading to less oxygen reaching the alveoli. 2. Fewer oxygen molecules would be available for exchange in the alveoli, further reducing the oxygen supply in the bloodstream. 3. The switch of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream would be less effective, causing more carbon dioxide to remain in the body, potentially exacerbating the feeling of breathlessness. So, the perturbation due to feeling breathless has a LESS effect on the second step mentioned (the expansion of the diaphragm and other muscles) as it hinders the adequate space creation for the lungs to fill with air. This, in turn, reduces oxygen intake and negatively affects the whole breathing process."},{"prompt":"Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person whose music, from the Fourth Symphony onwards, was strongly influenced by the music of Mahler? ? After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

Brendan Rodgers admits that he will have to win a trophy to be considered a success at Liverpool following last season’s title heartbreak. Liverpool achieved their aim of qualifying for the Champions League but suffered a late stumble in the Premier League title race and lost out to Manchester City on the final day. Rodgers insists the pain of that experience will drive his players on to go one better this season, but has warned that they will be judged on the trophies they win. Wants a trophy: Brendan Rodgers is looking to lead Liverpool to success after last season's slip-up. Team spirit: But the boss insists that means no extra pressure for his side, lead by Steven Gerrard. ‘I want a trophy this year,’ he said. ‘My sole aim in the first three years was to get us into the Champions League. I knew what it meant to the city and the supporters, so my drive in that period was to get us back. ‘Now I want the club to win the big trophies again. That’s what I said to the players. The expectancy this season is continual improvement. We want to win. To be successful is winning trophies. ‘I don’t think it puts pressure on us. We were ahead of schedule last year. I just think there is a real excitement, not pressure of last year. We know we can do it now. We embrace it and I am looking forward to this year. ‘We’ve got players who have had disappointments in their careers and picked themselves up again. We went so close but it is only the beginning for us. I’m super hungry to be a champion and succeed and in the short period of time we have shown we have the credentials to do that. ‘The Premier League is going to be as competitive as ever and we’ve got the belief behind us from the early stages of the season we can win it.’ Agonising: Liverpool - and Gerrard - slipped up at vital times last season, particularly against Chelsea. Dark times: Gerrard has retired from international football to focus on the task ahead with Liverpool. Rodgers believes Liverpool can take heart from Manchester United’s success in the 1990s after Sir Alex Ferguson’s team lost out to Leeds in the race for the old First Division title. ‘If you look at the history of the winning teams they have always come close,’ he added. ‘The United team that won it in 1993, they came close in 1992 when they lost it to Leeds. They came back the following year and won it. That set up an era of winning for them. It has made us even more unified and stronger to be more successful in the future.’ There are concerns about how Liverpool will cope with the loss of Luis Suarez, but Rodgers refuted suggestions that they would be perceived as a selling club after agreeing to let the Uruguay striker join Barcelona for £75million. Moving on: Rodgers insists Liverpool are not a selling club despite Luis Suarez leaving for Barcelona. Step up: Lazar Markovic will be one of those tasked with replacing the Uruguayan forward this season. Loving life: Rodgers oversees a training session during Liverpool's tour of the USA. ‘Liverpool is not a selling club, that’s for sure,’ he said. ‘The big clubs lose the big players at some point. That’s reality. It’s not due to any lack of ambition. Sometimes you lose your best player and the key is planning your success beyond that. ‘Luis had his time here and has looked to move on. He will be in Spain for a time and then end up back in South America. ‘We’re in a really healthy position now. The conversations we’ve had with players and agents is showing the power of the club is back again.’ What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1.

Here are the steps I've used to deduce this conclusion: 1. First, I reviewed the provided information. It states: \\"In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra...\\" 2. This indicates that the process of creating ski runs through mechanical methods has had a direct, destructive effect on the underlying tundra. 3. Moreover, it's also highlighted that once destroyed, the plant life in these areas cannot recover during non-skiing months. 4. It's also important to compare this with the consequences of using natural methods to build ski slopes, which according to the information, preserve the underlying layers of land. In summary, based on the information given, the statement \\"In some areas the modern practice of building ski runs by mechanical means has destroyed the underlying tundra from which the plant life cannot recover during the non-skiing months, whereas areas that still practice a natural piste type of ski slope building preserve the fragile underlayers.\\" is a correct answer.

The little party in the cabin, so disastrously begun, finished, under the mellowing influence of wine and woman, in excellent feeling and with some hilarity. Mamie, in a plush Gainsborough hat and a gown of wine-coloured silk, sat, an apparent queen, among her rude surroundings and companions. The dusky litter of the cabin set off her radiant trimness: tarry Johnson was a foil to her fair beauty; she glowed in that poor place, fair as a star; until even I, who was not usually of her admirers, caught a spark of admiration; and even the captain, who was in no courtly humour, proposed that the scene should be commemorated by my pencil. It was the last act of the evening. Hurriedly as I went about my task, the half-hour had lengthened out to more than three before it was completed: Mamie in full value, the rest of the party figuring in outline only, and the artist himself introduced in a back view, which was pronounced a likeness.

Jeff demands Mike's employer pay for the damage, but the man refuses. Mike pays him himself. Later, the police find Mike in a bar and arrest him for reckless driving and having an expired license.
