Read this and answer the question The quail is a small to medium-sized, cryptically coloured bird. In its natural environment, it is found in bushy places, in rough grassland, among agricultural crops, and in other places with dense cover. It feeds on seeds, insects, and other small invertebrates. Being a largely ground-dwelling, gregarious bird, domestication of the quail was not difficult, although many of its wild instincts are retained in captivity. It was known to the Egyptians long before the arrival of chickens and was depicted in hieroglyphs from 2575 BC. It migrated across Egypt in vast flocks and the birds could sometimes be picked up off the ground by hand. These were the common quail (Coturnix coturnix), but modern domesticated flocks are mostly of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) which was probably domesticated as early as the 11th century AD in Japan. They were originally kept as songbirds, and they are thought to have been regularly used in song contests.

Q: What resource is considered nonrewable for human purposes, because it takes so long to form and is depleted by farming and other activities? A: Answer:","completion":"Soil is considered a nonrenewable resource for human purposes due to the significant amount of time it takes to form and its depletion by various human activities, such as farming, deforestation, and urbanization. Soil formation is a slow process that occurs over thousands of years through the weathering of rocks, the decomposition of organic materials, and the activity of microorganisms. Due to the lengthy timescale involved in soil formation, it can be considered nonrenewable when subjected to unsustainable agricultural practices, deforestation, and other detrimental human activities. The overuse of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and the monoculture approach to farming can result in soil degradation and eventually lead to soil depletion, losing its essential nutrients and organic content. Excessive tillage and poor management practices can also lead to soil erosion, further depleting the soil's productivity. Additionally, deforestation and urbanization for infrastructure development eliminate natural vegetation, disrupting soil structure and contributing to the loss of valuable topsoil. To protect this critical nonrenewable resource, it's essential to adopt sustainable agriculture and land use practices, ensuring that soil health and fertility are preserved for future generations."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Lord Bichard, a former benefits chief, said \\"imaginative\\" ideas were needed to meet the cost of an ageing society. And although such a move might be controversial, it would stop older people being a \\"burden on the state\\". The peer is a member of a committee investigating demographic changes and their impact on public services. The panel was told that the transfer of wealth from young to old in the UK was the highest in Europe. Lord Bichard, a former head of the Benefits Agency and top civil servant at the Education Department, who is probably best known for chairing the 2004 inquiry into the Soham murders, said the debate on rising healthcare and pension costs needed to be broadened out. \\"Are there ways in which we could use incentives to encourage older people, if not to be in full time work, to be making a contribution?,\\" he asked the rest of the committee. \\"It is quite possible, for example, to envisage a world where civil society is making a greater contribution to the care of the very old, and older people who are not very old could be making a useful contribution to civil society in that respect, if they were given some incentive or some recognition for doing so.\\" The 65-year-old crossbench peer, who has taken on a number of roles including the vice presidency of the Local Government Association and the chairmanship of a national after-school film club since retiring from the civil service in 2001, suggested the government should use the pensions system to \\"incentivise\\" retired people. \\"We are now prepared to say to people who are not looking for work, if you don't look for work you don't get benefits, so if you are old and you are not contributing in some way or another maybe there is some penalty attached to that.\\" He asked: \\"Are we using all of the incentives at our disposal to encourage older people not just to be a negative burden on the state but actually be a positive part of society?\\" Prof Martin Weale, a member of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, said the proposal was \\"outside the normal range of what is discussed\\", but added it was an \\"interesting point\\". Asked about his suggestion after the meeting, Lord Bichard said it was a new idea but he intended to look into it further as part of his work for the committee. He acknowledged it would be difficult for politicians to sell to the public, but added: \\"So was tuition fees.\\" Pensioners' rights campaigners reacted angrily to Lord Bichard's idea. Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention, said: \\"This amounts to little more than national service for the over 60s and is absolutely outrageous. \\"Those who have paid their national insurance contributions for 30 or more years are entitled to receive their state pension and there should be no attempt to put further barriers in their way.\\" Michelle Mitchell, director general of the charity Age UK, said: \\"Older people are a hugely positive part of society - over a third of people aged between 65 and 74 volunteer, a percentage that only drops slightly for the over 75s. \\"In addition, nearly a million older people provide unpaid care to family or friends saving the state millions of pounds.\\" She added that almost a third of working age parents rely on grandparents to provide childcare - and more than 900,000 people are working past the traditional retirement age \\"either because they want to or because they can't afford to retire\\". But she added: \\"We must not forget that retirement is a vastly different experience depending on your personal circumstances. For example, 40% of all people over 65 have a serious longstanding illness and 1.7m of our pensioners live in poverty. \\"For many of those, retirement can be an unrelenting struggle of trying to survive on a low income in poor health.\\" Ros Altmann, director general of Saga, said: \\"This is a very strange idea indeed. Those who have retired have already made huge contributions to our society and are already the largest group of charity and community volunteers.\\" Prof James Sefton, of Imperial College, London, a former adviser to the Treasury, told the committee young people were effectively subsidising the older generation - and he could not understand why they were not protesting about it. \\"I think they should be angry. I think the deal they are getting is poor,\\" he told the peers. \\"There are a lot of transfers going on within the system, from the young towards the old and I think awareness of it is very poor and I think eventually it will come out.\\" He said research he was carrying out at Imperial College, with Dr David McCarthy, suggested \\"the current generation are very heavy contributors to the public purse, whereas previous generations have benefited from the public purse\\". This was mostly down to high house prices, high youth unemployment, rising public debt and the cost of education, added Prof Sefton, who is also a quantitative analyst at UBS bank. The older generation benefits from public funds, in the form of healthcare and pensions, but younger people have to rely more on \\"private transfers\\" of wealth, such as family money, to a far greater extent than in other European countries, he added. Update 26 October 2012: Lord Bichard has asked us to clarify that he was floating an idea at the committee rather than making a firm proposal. This report has been slightly amended to take account of that. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Lord Bichard, a former benefits chief, suggested an idea that retired people might need to do some work to receive their pensions. This idea is to help the cost of an ageing society. It might be controversial, but it would prevent older people from relying too much on the state for help.

Does it follow that \\"A brown, calf-bound book could be found on the little table.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it follows that \\"A brown, calf-bound book could be found on the little table.\\" Based on the given information, we can infer that the book was located somewhere around the boots. When Drew unstrapped the old pair of boots and fitted the new ones, the book fell to the floor. This event indicates that the book was placed at a nearby location, which could be the little table mentioned in your question. Furthermore, let me provide some additional context around this situation: Given the circumstances, it is likely that the brown, calf-bound book was resting on the little table due to its close proximity to the boots. This assumption is substantiated by the fact that the book fell to the floor when Drew interacted with the boots. The placement of the book on the table would have provided easy access for Drew, or anyone else who might require the information or content contained within. Additionally, the book's calf-bound nature suggests that it could be of some importance or valuable in some way. Calf-bound books are generally known for their durability and quality, often being associated with higher-end or luxury editions. Therefore, placing it on a table would imply that it was being showcased or readily available for reference or use, further supporting the idea that the book could be found on the little table. In conclusion, based on the information and observations provided, it is reasonable to conclude that \\"A brown, calf-bound book could be found on the little table.\\" As Drew interacted with the boots, causing the book to fall, it is credible that the book was positioned somewhere close to the boots, and the little table seems like a fitting location for such a book."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens. When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng's peasant rebels in 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Mancus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper. Schoppa, the editor of The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History argues, \\"A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'.

Staying at the Riviera was the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Absolute nightmare. My girlfriend and I had booked 3 nights at the Riviera 3 and half months before we stayed there. We selected a non-smoking luxury room with a king bed. I double checked the reservation before we left, and everything was good to go - we were excited! We checked into the hotel late in the evening and were given our room key along with some brochures. Tired from the drive, we couldn't wait to get to our room and crash. But upon finding our room we discovered that we had been placed in a smoking, classic room with two beds. The room stank. Neither I nor my girlfriend are smokers, and though we had specifically booked a non-smoking room, we were forced to cohabitate amidst the saturated stench of a dirty ash tray. But the smell wasn't the only unpleasant thing about the room, not by a long shot. For starters, it was ugly as sin. There walls were stained, the bathroom cabinets were missing knobs, and the wallpaper was so hideous that it took every ounce of willpower I had not to gouge my eyes out. I immediately called the front desk to get this sorted out, explaining that there was a mistake and we had not been placed in the room we ordered online. The front desk clerk told me that the hotel was completely booked and there were no available rooms to switch into. She suggested checking back in the morning around 11:00 a.m. to see if there had been any check outs. 11 a.m. rolls around and I am at the front desk checking to see if anything has opened up. Nothing. The clerk tells me there are still no available rooms, but to try back in a few hours. Fast forward and I'm back there again listening to them tell me that there are no rooms and there is nothing they can do. I ask to speak to the manager, and after about 15 minutes of waiting, he comes out of his office to speak with me. The clerks at least pretended like they wanted to help me and were doing everything they could, this guy had a pompous air about him that let me know I was wasting his time before he even said anything. I once again explained my situation, to which he smugly replied that the room choice option on their website was a preference and did not guarantee that the preferred room type would be reserved. Furthermore he told me that the hotel had enough guests to fill the luxury rooms, so he didn't feel inclined to switch us. Then, with the phoniest and most self-satisfied smile I had ever seen, he reiterated that there was nothing more he could do. What kind of bullshit is that? I don't know about you, but when I book a room I assume that the room I booked will be reserved. Feeling defeated, I retired to my room to tell my girlfriend what had happened. But it wasn't over. Later that night, we were getting ready to go to sleep. I was laying on the bed watching TV and she was just stepping into the bathroom when suddenly she released a blood curdling shriek. She screamed so loud I was sure I was about to see a dead body laying there on the bathroom floor. What I saw was worse. Scurrying across the floor was the most enormous cockroach I have ever seen. This thing was HUGE I'm talking the size of a small mouse. After completely losing our shit, my girlfriend and I regrouped to formulate a plan of attack. Our first instinct was to curb stomp the shit out of this vile creature, and send it back to the pits of hell from whence it came. But we resisted these urges in favor of a much more devious plan - bring it to the front desk. I somehow managed to capture the disgusting hell-beast in a plastic cup, and skipped joyfully down to the lobby to speak with the manager. He emerged from his office looking complacent as ever, no doubt prepared to send me packing once again. \\"How can I help y--\\" he began to say as I placed the cup on the counter in front of him. Upon seeing this captured behemoth, his eyes went wide and the smugness left his face faster than you can say \\"la cucaracha.\\" He was utterly petrified, and I was loving every second. Fixated on the cup for a few moments, he looked up at me with a grimace and said \\"I don't like bugs.\\" And without missing a beat my girlfriend replied, \\"Neither do we.\\" The delivery of that line could have been straight out of a movie, almost too good to be unscripted. To his credit, the manager ended up giving us a 40 compensation to eat at one of the hotel restaurants. It didn't make up for our experience but at least it was something. In addition, he MAGICALLY found a luxury room for us to stay in for our final night there. So on one hand that was nice, but also a glaring confirmation that those assholes lied to us about the hotel being completely booked. Overall, I would rate my experience at the Riviera as thoroughly horrendous and would NOT recommend anyone to go there. Ever. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","completion":"This review can be described as having an overwhelmingly negative sentiment. The guest experienced a series of issues and inconveniences during their stay at the Riviera, including being given the wrong room, unhelpful staff and management, and encountering a large cockroach in the bathroom. The guest explicitly states that they had the worst hotel experience ever and strongly advises against others booking a stay at the Riviera. Although the manager eventually compensated the guest and provided the originally requested room, these actions did not redeem the overall negative experience."},{"prompt":"I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Now, I have a new situation: Jake and Todd used different farming methods to produce their crops. Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method. Answer this question please: Which farmer had less residue from the prior year's crops?

Q:I had this one guy, who enjoyed being a part time bully and part time neutral to me. To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Napoleon Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.

The incident, which took place at 4 pm, saw the traditional cob cottage, built in a terraced style, collapse along with the scaffolding adjoining the structure. Thankfully, no injuries were reported, and the house was empty at the time of the event. The collapse occurred near the town centre, resulting in debris falling into the street, which temporarily disrupted local traffic. This collapse of a tradiational cob-built cottage marks the second such occurrence in Devon within a week. On 4 September, a 400-year-old cob cottage in nearby East Budleigh faced a similar fate. The owner's father, John Timms, and two builders were fortunate enough to escape without injury, having fled just in the nick of time as they heard the cob structure cracking. Recounting the experience, Timms explained, \\"'I heard cracking noises, which became louder, so I got out.\\" The three witnesses watched from a safe distance as the historic property succumbed to the collapse. The incidents have raised concerns around the preservation and maintenance of heritage buildings in the region, especially given that cob construction is revered as a functional, sustainable, and fireproof building material. Cob is a traditional house-building technique commonly used in Devon, which utilises a mix of clay, earth, and straw to create sturdy, durable structures. Dawlish and East Budleigh are not the only places in Devon that showcase this ancient construction technique. Many more historic cob-built cottages still stand proudly across the county, representing architectural gems rich in cultural significance. These recent collapses may serve as a wake-up call for property owners and local authorities to take appropriate measures in ensuring these heritage buildings are well-maintained and structurally sound, to preserve their invaluable legacy for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the information provided does not directly answer the question about David's diet from the Bible. David, a significant figure in the Hebrew Bible, Christianity, and Islam, was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah. Although David is a prophet in Islam, the details about his diet in the Bible are not mentioned in the answer. In the Bible, specific dietary guidelines for David are not explicitly discussed. However, we can infer some aspects of his diet based on the cultural and religious practices during his time. The ancient Israelites followed the dietary laws outlined in the Hebrew Bible, specifically in the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Based on these dietary laws, the following would likely be components of David's diet: 1. Meats: David would have consumed meat from animals considered \\"clean\\" according to the biblical dietary laws, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and deer. Poultry like chicken, dove, and turkey would also be part of his diet. All meat would have to be prepared according to kosher guidelines, including proper slaughtering and draining of blood. 2. Fish: Fish with fins and scales, such as salmon, trout, and tilapia, would be permitted in David's diet. Shellfish and other non-kosher seafood would not be consumed. 3. Grains: Bread, barley, and wheat were staple grains in the ancient Near East. David would have consumed bread and other grain-based products as a primary source of carbohydrates. 4. Fruits and vegetables: A diet in the ancient Near East would be incomplete without fresh fruits and vegetables. Common produce items included figs, olives, grapes, pomegranates, melons, and cucumbers. 5. Dairy products: Milk, cheese, and yogurt would have been part of David's diet. However, it is essential to note that according to the laws in the Hebrew Bible, dairy products could not be consumed in the same meal as meat. 6. Fats and oils: Olive oil was prevalent in the ancient Near East and was a central cooking ingredient in David's time. It would have been used as a primary source of fat. 7. Legumes and nuts: Almonds, pistachios, lentils, and chickpeas were commonly consumed and would likely be part of David's diet. 8. Spices and herbs: David's diet would have included a variety of seasonings, like cumin, coriander, mint, and dill. 9. Beverages: Water, wine, and vinegar were standard beverages in the Near East. David is known to have drunk wine, as mentioned in the Bible, but it is essential to note that alcohol consumption was generally moderate during his time as cultural values emphasized self-control and discipline. In conclusion, although we cannot provide explicit details about David's diet from the Bible, we can deduce his diet based on the cultural, religious, and historical context of his time. David would have followed the dietary laws outlined in the Hebrew Bible and consumed a diet comprising of various meats, fish, grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, legumes, nuts, and beverages permitted by these laws."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

Im also upset cuz I was outbid in eBay auction","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet can be analyzed through different aspects: missing dinner, being upset, and losing an eBay auction. By examining these elements, we can determine the overall sentiment of the tweet. Firstly, the mention of not eating dinner may imply a negative sentiment due to the fact that missing a meal could be a result of a busy schedule, lack of sustenance, or a conscious decision to skip it. In any case, not having dinner can lead to the tweeter feeling hungry or dissatisfied. Secondly, the tweeter explicitly expresses their emotional state by stating they are \\"upset.\\" This word choice demonstrates a clear negative sentiment. Being upset can result from various events or emotions; in this particular tweet, the cause seems to lie in the loss of an eBay auction. Lastly, being outbid in an eBay auction suggests that the tweeter failed to secure a desired item. For most people, losing out on something they had hoped to win can invoke negative emotions, such as disappointment, frustration, and even a sense of loss. Consequently, this part of the tweet further reinforces the negative sentiment. Taking all of these factors into consideration, it is clear that the overall sentiment of this tweet is decidedly negative. The tweeter conveys their dissatisfaction about not eating dinner, explicitly mentions being upset, and is disappointed about losing out in an eBay auction, which cumulatively contribute to the negative tone of the message."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As part of the housing and credit booms, the number of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO), which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What are CDO as related to the housing and credit booms?","completion":"Collateralized Debt Obligations, often referred to as CDOs, played a significant role in the housing and credit booms that took place in the early and mid-2000s. Understanding CDOs necessitates first understanding the general landscape of the financial industry during this period. The climate in the early 2000s was characterized by an increase in housing prices and a concurrent global surge in credit availability. A component of this credit availability came in the form of mortgages issued to homeowners, many of whom were considered subprime borrowers due to their lower credit scores or potentially unstable financial circumstances. These subprime mortgages were often offered with adjustable rates, meaning the interest rate and thus the monthly payment could fluctuate over time. In an effort to capitalize on this situation, financial institutions began to bundle together these subprime mortgages and sell them as investment opportunities. They would group many of these mortgages into pools based on their perceived level of credit risk and then sell shares in these pools to investors. When a homeowner made a mortgage payment, the money would flow through the pool and eventually be paid out as returns to the investors holding the shares. These bundled financial products came to be known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Collateralized Debt Obligations are a further step in this chain. In essence, a CDO is a type of asset-backed security, similar to MBS. However, unlike a straightforward MBS which is backed by a pool of mortgages, a CDO is often backed by a diversified pool of assets which could include things like bonds, loans, or even other MBS. The pool of assets is divided into tranches, which are essentially different risk classes. Investors can invest in different tranches based on their risk appetite. Higher risk tranches offer higher potential returns but also carry a higher risk of default. CDOs were considered financial innovations because they appeared to offer the potential for higher returns without a proportional increase in risk. A key characteristic of a CDO—and one that differentiated it from a standard MBS—is the use of tranching. Because the underlying assets are divided into tranches or slices, the CDO can cater to different risk appetites by selling different tranches to different investors. The highest-risk tranche would be the first to absorb any losses from the underlying assets, followed by the next highest risk tranche, and so on. During the housing boom, an expansion of the CDO market came in the form of synthetic CDOs. These financial products were based on credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps, and they allowed investors to speculate on the mortgage market without actually owning any mortgages. However, the downfall of CDOs came about when housing prices began to decline, and the subprime mortgages that underpinned many of the issuances started going into default. As defaults increased, the value of the underlying assets plunged, and many tranches of the CDOs became worthless, leading to significant losses among the global financial institutions that had invested heavily in them. In conclusion, CDOs were financial products, originated in the wake of the housing and credit booms, that appeared to offer the prospect of higher returns without a proportional increase in risk. They played a crucial role in the global financial crisis that followed the collapse of the housing market, and their demise served as a stark reminder of the dangers of financial innovation without adequate understanding or regulation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The dim lighting and uncomfortable chairs only made the ambiance worse. The service at Fancy Bistro was equally disappointing. Our server took a long time to take our order, and it was evident that they were not familiar with the menu. It took almost an hour for our food to arrive, despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't busy at the time. Moreover, when we requested additional condiments and utensils, our server forgot to bring them to the table. As for the food, it was a letdown. The steak I ordered was overcooked and lacked flavor, while the vegetables accompanying it were soggy and unappetizing. My dining companion's pasta dish tasted bland, and the sauce was watery. Both meals were overpriced for their quality, and we found that the portion sizes were quite small compared to other restaurants in the same category.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert Joseph Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons. Cousy was initially drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1950 NBA draft, but after he refused to report, he was picked up by Boston. Cousy took up basketball at the age of 13 as a student at St. Pascal's elementary school, and was \\"immediately hooked\\". The following year, he entered Andrew Jackson High School in St Albans. His basketball success was not immediate, and in fact he was cut from the school team in his first year. Later that year, he joined the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League, a basketball league sponsored by the Long Island Press, where he began to develop his basketball skills and gained much-needed experience. The next year, however, he was again cut during the tryouts for the school basketball team. That same year, he fell out of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him effectively ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as \\"a fortunate event\\" and cited it as a factor in making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure he was going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college. He again excelled in basketball his senior year, leading his team to the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, and he wanted to go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, and he was not interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players. Did he try out again the second year?","completion":"Yes, Robert Cousy tried out again for the school basketball team during his second year at Andrew Jackson High School in St. Albans.

It was only in his junior year that he managed to join the varsity squad after initially being ineligible due to failing his citizenship course. Making a significant impact in his first game with 28 points, he went on to excel in basketball, eventually leading his team to the Queens divisional championship during his senior year and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chinese climbers plan to take the Olympic flame to the top of the world's highest peak, at 8,848 meters (29,028 feet) as part of the global relay leading up to the August 8 opening of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. Spring is the most popular season for climbing Mount Everest, which straddles the border between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China. The Nepali government has given permits to dozens of climbers from 30 expeditions this season. But between May 1 and May 10, climbers are _ from going above 6,400 meters until the torch run is completed. China plans to take the Olympic flame to the summit sometime then. Bad weather conditions allow only about two opportunities in May for a push to the summit. The Chinese have not allowed any expedition to climb the mountain from the north side, according the Kathmandu representative of the Tibet China Mountaineering Association. Almost every day in the past month, Nepalese police have arrested pro-Tibet protesters from in front of the Chinese Embassy and the United Nations offices. The demonstrators are released later in the evening. Supporters of Tibet punish the government's attitude toward the autonomous region, and many believe China should not have been awarded the honor of hosting the Olympic Games.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"How are the online intermediaries protected under the European law?\\" Context: \\"The U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (1998) and the European E-Commerce Directive (2000) provide online intermediaries with limited statutory immunity from liability for copyright infringement. Online intermediaries hosting content that infringes copyright are not liable, so long as they do not know about it and take actions once the infringing content is brought to their attention. In U.S. law this is characterized as \\"safe harbor\\" provisions. Under European law, the governing principles for Internet Service Providers are \\"mere conduit\\", meaning that they are neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge of what they are carrying; and 'no obligation to monitor' meaning that they cannot be given a general mandate by governments to monitor content. These two principles are a barrier for certain forms of online copyright enforcement and they were the reason behind an attempt to amend the European Telecoms Package in 2009 to support new measures against copyright infringement.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"Online intermediaries play a crucial role in the digital landscape, facilitating the exchange of information, content and services between parties. These intermediaries include Internet service providers (ISPs), search engines, social media platforms, and content hosting websites. To ensure the continued growth and innovation of the digital economy, online intermediaries in Europe are provided with certain protections under European law. The European E-Commerce Directive (2000) is the primary legislative framework governing online intermediaries' liability for copyright infringement in Europe. This directive establishes three main principles that provide immunity to online intermediaries for hosting copyrighted content, namely: 'mere conduit,' 'caching,' and 'hosting.' 1. Mere Conduit (Article 12): The 'mere conduit' principle safeguards ISPs that merely transmit information from one point to another, without altering or manipulating its content. As these ISPs serve as neutral 'pipes' with no knowledge or control over the data they transmit, they are exempt from liability for any copyright infringement that may occur during this process. This principle ensures that the ISPs are not held responsible for the actions of their users and do not suffer legal consequences for enabling access to infringing content. 2. Caching (Article 13): Caching refers to the temporary storage of data for the purpose of improving the efficiency and speed of data retrieval. Online intermediaries that engage in caching activities are protected from liability if they meet certain conditions. These conditions include that the storage is temporary, automatic, and aimed at improving the service, and that the intermediary does not modify the content. Additionally, the intermediary must act expeditiously to remove the cached content upon becoming aware that it has been removed from the source or if a court orders removal. 3. Hosting (Article 14): Hosting providers, such as social media platforms and content-sharing websites, are granted immunity from liability for hosting copyrighted material if they do not have actual knowledge of the infringing content or are not aware of circumstances indicating the presence of such content. Under the 'no obligation to monitor' clause, hosting providers are not required to proactively monitor user-generated material for copyright infringement. However, if they receive a legitimate notice of infringing content by a rights holder or become aware of any unlawful content, they must act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the content to maintain their immunity. It is worth noting that the European legal framework has recently undergone reforms aiming to clarify the role and responsibilities of online intermediaries. The Digital Single Market Strategy, implemented through various legislative initiatives, including the Copyright Directive (2019), seeks to strike a balance between copyright protection, user rights, and intermediary liability. Of particular importance is Article 17 of the Copyright Directive, which imposes specific obligations on certain online content-sharing service providers to obtain authorization from rights holders for hosting copyrighted content. This article potentially narrows the liability exemptions for platforms and requires them to implement robust mechanisms to prevent the availability of unauthorized content. In summary, online intermediaries in Europe enjoy protection under the E-Commerce Directive, which provides them with limited immunity from liability for copyright infringement, based on principles such as 'mere conduit,' 'caching,' and 'hosting.' The European legal landscape is continually evolving to adapt to the fast-paced digital environment, ensuring that the rights of content creators, users, and online intermediaries are adequately protected and balanced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"\\"Feel pain\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for the following reasons: Step 1: Analyzing the question The question asks what an animal does when it becomes old. This implies that we are looking for an action or experience that is specifically related to the aging process in an animal. Step 2: Analyzing the possible answers We have the following possible answers: live long, leave home, feel pain, eating, and sense fear in human. It's important to note which of these answers are connected to the aging process of an animal. Step 3: Identifying relevant answers Among the possible answers, \\"live long\\" is an expectation of aging but doesn't describe a specific action or experience. \\"Leave home\\" isn't necessarily related to aging. \\"Eating\\" is a general action that all animals do regardless of age. \\"Sense fear in human\\" is not directly related to the animal's aging process.

If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What was the last crisis during cold war to escalate world powers?","completion":"The last major crisis during the Cold War that escalated tensions among world powers was the Able Archer 83 exercise, which took place in November 1983. This was a realistic NATO military exercise simulating a potential conflict between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, particularly focusing on communication between NATO countries. During the exercise, the Soviet Union misinterpreted the simulation as preparations for an actual nuclear attack on their territory. The heightened alert level and increased military activity on both sides brought the world uncomfortably close to a real confrontation. This event was marked by high levels of tension and mistrust between the superpowers, with both the United States and the Soviet Union fearing that a conflict could spiral into a full-scale war. A contributing factor to this tense atmosphere was the deployment of Pershing II intermediate-range ballistic missiles by the United States in Western Europe earlier that year. This move escalated the arms race and further strained relations between the two superpowers. Additionally, the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by the Soviet Union in September 1983 added to the existing tensions. The Able Archer 83 incident exemplifies the delicate nature of the balance of power during the Cold War era and how easily misinterpretation or miscommunication could have led to catastrophic consequences. Fortunately, the exercise ended without any direct military confrontation, and the crisis was ultimately resolved peacefully. It served as an important lesson for both the U.S. and the USSR about the importance of clear communication and the dangers of miscalculations in geopolitics. As a result, it contributed to the ongoing efforts towards diplomatic solutions and arms control negotiations in later years, eventually leading to the end of the Cold War."},{"prompt":"This task involves creating questions from a given passage that involve some kind of complex reasoning (including numerical reasoning).

Passage: On November 18, 1918 the People's Council of Latvia proclaimed the Independence of the Republic of Latvia and created the Latvian Provisional Government headed by Kārlis Ulmanis.On December 1, 1918 the newly proclaimed republic was invaded by Soviet Russia.Much of the invadinig army in Latvia consisted of Red Latvian Riflemen, which made the invasion easier. The Soviet offensive met little resistance. In the north Alūksne was taken on December 7, Valka on December 18, and Cēsis on December 23, in the south Daugavpils was taken on December 9 and Pļaviņas on December 17. Riga was captured by the Red Army on January 3, 1919. By the end of January the Latvian Provisional Government and remaining German units had retreated all the way to Liepāja, but then the Red offensive stalled along the Venta river. The Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic was officially proclaimed on January 13 with the political, economic, and military backing of the Soviet Russia.","completion":"1. How many days after the Independence of the Republic of Latvia was Alūksne taken by the Soviet offensive? Answer: 19 days Reasoning: The Independence of the Republic of Latvia was proclaimed on November 18, 1918, and Alūksne was taken on December 7. To find the difference, count the days between the two dates: November (30-18) = 12 days and December (7-1) = 6 days. Add the numbers: 12 + 6 = 19 days. 2. How many days elapsed between the capture of Daugavpils and the capture of Riga by the Red Army? Answer: 25 days Reasoning: Daugavpils was taken on December 9, and Riga was captured on January 3. To find the difference, count the days between the two dates: December (31-9) = 22 days and January (3-1) = 2 days. Add the numbers: 22 + 2 = 25 days. 3. What is the difference in days between the capture of Pļaviņas and the official proclamation of the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic? Answer: 27 days Reasoning: Pļaviņas was taken on December 17, and the Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic was officially proclaimed on January 13. To find the difference, count the days between the two dates: December (31-17) = 14 days and January (13-1) = 12 days. Add the numbers: 14 + 12 = 27 days. 4. How many days after the capture of Valka did the Soviet Russia invade the newly proclaimed Republic of Latvia?

To find the difference, count the days between the two dates: December (18-1) = 17 days. 5. In total, how many days did it take for the Red Army to capture both Alūksne and Pļaviņas starting from the invasion of the newly proclaimed Republic of Latvia? Answer: 30 days Reasoning: The invasion was on December 1, Alūksne was taken on December 7, and Pļaviņas on December 17. To find how many days it took to capture both, count the days between December 1 and December 17: December (17-1) = 30 days."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let c be the total cost of the vacation, and x be the cost per person when divided among 3 people. So, we have the relationship: c = 3x 2. If the total cost had been divided equally among 4 people, the cost per person would have been 60 less. In this scenario, the cost per person is (x - 60). Therefore, we have another relationship: c = 4(x - 60) 3. Now, we have a system of two equations with two variables (c and x): c = 3x c = 4(x - 60) 4. We can substitute the first equation into the second one: 3x = 4(x - 60) 5. Now, let's solve for x: 3x = 4x - 240 240 = x 6.

However, the Raiders orchestrated a successful goal-line stand, forcing Denver to turn the ball over on downs after a fourth-and-goal from the 1-yard line was stopped. Two plays later, however, Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell was intercepted by Denver safety Renaldo Hill after throwing from his own end zone. The Broncos then drove 23 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard Kyle Orton pass to Brandon Marshall. The next Raiders drive lasted just 3 plays after Russell was intercepted again, this time by Broncos cornerback Andre Goodman. This led to a 48-yard field goal by Broncos kicker Matt Prater, giving them a 10-0 lead going into the 2nd quarter. Oakland's first drive of the second quarter was also their most successful. They went 56 yards in over 8 minutes, leading to a 48-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal. Denver then drove 76 yards, although Oakland again held Denver out of the end zone, leading to a 21-yard Prater field goal and giving the Broncos a 13-3 lead going into halftime. Denver then opened the half with another scoring drive, this time going 80 yards in 8 plays and scoring on a 7-yard run by rookie running back Knowshon Moreno. It was the first touchdown of Moreno's NFL career. Oakland was forced to punt on their next drive. However, on Denver's first play from scrimmage, running back Correll Buckhalter fumbled the ball at their own 16-yard line, giving Oakland the ball in Denver territory for just the 3rd time on the day. However, 2 plays later, Raiders running back Darren McFadden fumbled the ball for the second time on the day (the first time was recovered by Oakland), giving Denver the ball back at their own 11. They then drove 88 yards in 16 plays and over 8 minutes, although the Raiders again held them out of the end zone, leading to a Prater 24-yard field goal. The Broncos won the game primarily on the strength of their running game and the defense. Correll Buckhalter ran 14 times for 108 yards, while rookie Knowshown Moreno ran 21 times for 90 yards. Overall, the Broncos had 215 yards rushing on the day. The defense held the Raiders to just 137 total yards and 9 first downs, caused 2 interceptions and 1 fumble, and also sacked JaMarcus Russell 3 times, 2 of them by star defensive end Elvis Dumervil (who had 4 in the previous game against the Cleveland Browns). Russell had just 61 yards passing on 21 attempts with 2 interceptions, giving him a quarterback rating of 22.6.

Jean-Baptiste Frederic Isidor, Baron Thielemans (29 April 1922 - 22 August 2016), known professionally as Toots Thielemans, was a Belgian-American jazz musician. He was known for his harmonica playing, as well as his guitar, whistling skills, and composing. According to jazz historian Ted Gioia, his most important contribution was in \\"championing the humble harmonica\\", which Thielemans made into a \\"legitimate voice in jazz\\". He eventually became the \\"preeminent\\" jazz harmonica player. During the early 1980s Thielemans was a guest a number of times on Late Night with David Letterman. He has performed with the bassist Jaco Pastorius, and in 1983 he contributed to Billy Joel's album An Innocent Man, in the song, \\"Leave A Tender Moment Alone.\\" (The two later collaborated on this selection in concert, and this was recorded on video.) A year later, he appeared on the Julian Lennon song \\"Too Late for Goodbyes\\" from the album Valotte. In 1984, he recorded with Billy Eckstine on the singer's final album (I Am a Singer), featuring ballads and standards arranged and conducted by Angelo DiPippo. In the 1990s, Thielemans embarked on theme projects that included world music. In 1998 he released a French-flavoured album titled Chez Toots featuring guest singer Johnny Mathis. During those years, he often recorded songs as personal tributes to those who were influential during his career. On Chez Toots, for example, he included \\"Dance For Victor,\\" which he dedicated to his sometimes keyboard accompanist, Victor Feldman. Similarly, he recorded \\"Waltz for Sonny\\" as a tribute to saxophonist Sonny Rollins. In June 1998, at Germany's Jazzbaltica, he paid tribute to Frank Sinatra who died a month earlier. And during the first Caspian Jazz and Blues Festival in Azerbaijan in 2002, he performed his recorded version of \\"Imagine,\\" his tribute to its writer, John Lennon.

Please write a short summary for the following article: About 16% of High School Students Are Now Using E-Cigarettes E-cigarette use among teenagers and pre-teens rose over the last year, and have become the tobacco product of choice among students. Around 5.3% of middle-school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2015, which is up from 3.9% in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. E-cigarette usage among high school students has hit 16%, and that’s significantly up from the 1.5% who vaped in 2011. Such is the popularity of e-cigarettes, that it has become the most used tobacco product among teenagers, with around 3 million reportedly using then. Overall, around 4.7 million middle and high school students are using any form of tobacco product, and when dissected, roughly one in four high school students and one in 13 middle school students use some kind of tobacco product. The study of tobacco usage among youth is important, as while smoking rates have declined in the past decade, 80% of adult smokers first try smoking by the age of 18. What remains unclear, however, is whether vaping leads to smoking. In the CDC’s latest report, the rise in e-cig usage is in tandem with a gradual decrease in the use of normal cigarettes—among all high school students, that has declined from 15.8% in 2011 to 9.3% last year. It provides some proof that e-cigarettes, which are generally regarded as less toxic than cigarettes, may not lead to teens picking up the smoking habit. “We do not have any strong evidence that it is encouraging smoking among kids but neither do we have good evidence that it won’t over time,” Kenneth E.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Process: - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose diaphragm expands for more air happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the proposed perturbation, in which the diaphragm expands more than usual, can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of gas exchange, potentially leading to less efficient oxygen delivery to the body. Direct effects: When the diaphragm expands more than usual, it creates a greater negative pressure within the thoracic cavity. This increased negative pressure can lead to a higher volume of air being inhaled into the lungs. Theoretically, this should result in more oxygen being delivered to the body. However, if the rate of expansion of the diaphragm outpaces the lungs' capacity to expand and the alveoli's ability to perform gas exchange efficiently, it might prevent the oxygen from properly diffusing across the alveolar-capillary membrane into the bloodstream. As a result, an increased diaphragm expansion can potentially lead to less efficient oxygen delivery to the body. Indirect effects: The increased expansion of the diaphragm can affect other aspects of the respiratory system, which in turn may impact the efficiency of oxygen delivery. For example: 1. Altered ventilation-perfusion ratio: The efficiency of gas exchange depends on the appropriate matching of ventilation (airflow) and perfusion (blood flow) within the lungs. If the diaphragm expands more than normal, it can potentially lead to a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion within the lung regions. This extreme expansion may overinflate some alveoli in the well-ventilated areas, compressing neighboring capillaries and impeding blood flow. At the same time, poorly inflated areas receive reduced airflow. Consequently, oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange decreases, resulting in less oxygen delivery to the body. 2. Respiratory muscle fatigue: If the diaphragm continuously expands more than necessary, it can cause respiratory muscle fatigue over time. This state of fatigue can impair the efficiency of breathing, leading to shallow and rapid breaths, which do not allow sufficient airflow for proper oxygen exchange. Consequently, less oxygen is delivered to the body. 3. Impact on lung compliance and elasticity: The increased diaphragmatic expansion can potentially stress the lung tissue, compromising its compliance and elasticity. By stiffening the lungs, it could make it more difficult for the lungs to expand sufficiently for effective gas exchange, and eventually result in less oxygen delivery to the body. In summary, although the perturbation of the diaphragm expanding more than usual might seem initially beneficial by taking in more air, it can ultimately affect the efficiency of oxygen delivery to the body. Both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory system can occur, including impaired gas exchange, respiratory muscle fatigue, and impact on lung compliance and elasticity. It is essential to maintain proper diaphragmatic expansion and respiratory mechanics for optimal oxygen delivery to the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: Encourage your partner to avoid sleeping on their back. This can make snoring worse by putting pressure on your partner's diaphragm. Some have recommended sleeping with something uncomfortable, like a tennis ball, sewn into the back of a shirt. This will make it awkward for your partner to sleep on their back and forces them to sleep in another way. Being overweight is a common cause of snoring. The extra weight affects the lungs and neck, making airflow blocked or strained during sleep. Being overweight is not always a cause of snoring, however, it does increase the probability that snoring will occur. Excess body fat will increase the chances of developing sleep apnea. Changing aspects of a lifestyle, such as losing weight, are usually recommended starting points to stop snoring. Have your partner ask your doctor for more information on how you can best lose weight. Nasal strips are an over-the-counter method of improving airflow through the nose. The nasal strip works by slightly pulling open, and keeping open, the nostrils. The improved airflow will help reduce snoring. Falling asleep with the nasal strip on may be unusual at first. Continued use will help your partner get used to the nasal strip. These strips won't be helpful to anyone suffering from sleep apnea because sleep apnea is caused by collapsed soft tissues in the back of the throat. Alcohol consumption and smoking can affect the throat and respiratory systems. Have your partner reduce the use of either to help prevent snoring from occurring. Alcohol causes the neck and tongue to relax which can obstruct airflow. Never drink alcohol right before sleep as this will make snoring worse. Smoking damages the throat and respiratory system. By reducing the amount your partner smokes, the chances of snoring occurring will also be reduced. Remember that snoring is a symptom of some other issue. Have your partner visit your doctor to determine exactly what the cause of their snoring may be. Examine the following list of possibilities to get an idea of what to expect: Nasal blockages. This may be due to chronic congestion or the configuration of your nasal passages, such as a deviated septum. Untreated allergies. Allergies can produce swelling of tissue in the nose and throat, as well as cause mucus production that can make breathing difficult. Obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a potentially serious medical condition that your doctor will want to address. This occurs when your throat tissue blocks your airway and prevents breathing entirely. If other options have not put an end to the snoring, ask your doctor about surgical options. Depending on your partners situation, there are a few different surgeries that may be recommend by your doctor: If your partners palate is the cause of their snoring, their doctor may recommend palatal implants. These are strands of polyester filament that are placed within the soft palate the mouth, which stiffen and prevent snoring. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) may be recommended if your partner has excess or loose tissue in or around the throat. By removing and tightening this tissue, this cause of snoring is eliminated. Laser and radio/sonic based treatments can also be used to shrink any excessive amounts of tissue in the throat. These are both outpatient procedures and are not as invasive as traditional surgery. Summary:","completion":"To help your partner stop snoring, make sure they don't sleep on their back, as it can make snoring worse. They can try losing weight if they are overweight because extra fat can cause snoring. They could use nasal strips to help them breathe better at night. Drinking less alcohol and not smoking can also help stop snoring. If the snoring continues, your partner should see a doctor to find out the cause, which may be allergies, a blocked nose, or a condition called sleep apnea. If nothing else works, the doctor might suggest special treatments or surgeries to stop the snoring."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The woman tried to put the new bra inside the drawer but the","completion":"drawer was too small and cluttered with various other garments, making it incredibly difficult for her to make room for the new addition to her collection. The cramped space was already overflowing with a medley of her essential wardrobe items, ranging from delicate lace undergarments and versatile sports bras to vibrantly colored scarves and comfortable, everyday socks. Each item was meticulously folded and arranged, albeit tightly packed, to optimize the limited space within the small, wooden compartment. In an attempt to accommodate the new bra, she carefully began sifting through the existing contents, evaluating the necessity of each item as she attempted to create a comfortable nook for the pristine undergarment. The bra in her hands was exquisite, gifted to her by a close friend as a symbol of love and support. Crafted from the finest fabric, it boasted intricate floral designs with delicate lace trimmings, making her feel both comfortable and confident when she wore it. The addition of this garment held significant sentimental value, thus adding to her determination to find the ideal place for it within her drawer. As she gently pushed aside a vibrant, patterned scarf, she discovered that by folding it differently, she could maximize the available space and create a small pocket just large enough for the new bra. With steadfast hands, she delicately folded the scarf into a compact square, allowing her to clear the necessary room needed for the new undergarment. Cautiously, she maneuvered the bra into position, taking great care to not disrupt the surrounding items, while ensuring that it maintained its shape and quality. Although the drawer was still exceedingly full, her efforts granted her the ability to accommodate the latest addition to her collection. The color of the new bra blended seamlessly with the assortment of garments within the drawer, creating a visually pleasing arrangement that brought her a sense of contentment. The act of organizing and making room for what mattered most to her reinforced the importance of cherishing cherished possessions and adapting to change, even within the seemingly small and trivial aspects of life. Satisfied with her accomplishment, she carefully closed the drawer, preserving the order within as she went about her day. The memory of this moment would forever serve as a gentle reminder of the value in making room for the things and people that truly matter in life, while also highlighting the need to declutter and reevaluate one's priorities from time to time.

Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars . But how do we make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these: a) Each nest must have six boards for its cover and floor, for its left and right sides, and for its front and back sides. Don't make the boards too slippery . b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a \\"door\\". The \\"door\\" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily. c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest. d) One piece of the board should be easy to open. e) Don't forget to colour the nest. When we're watching birds, we have to _ . A) look after the birds more often B) use the binoculars to catch the birds C) hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual D) catch the birds at last Answer:","completion":"When we find a bird nest, it indeed provides us an excellent opportunity to observe and learn about birds. Since birds take care of their babies and lay eggs between April and June, it's the perfect time for bird-watching. The baby birds are too young to leave the nest, so the parents go out frequently to look for food, returning every few minutes. This behavior makes it easier for us to watch them. While watching birds, it is essential to remain hidden from their view as much as possible. Hiding near the nest and using binoculars to observe them from a close distance allows the birds to continue their natural behavior without disturbance. It is crucial not to disturb the birds while observing them. As for creating a bird nest, a good one has to be made with care, ensuring it is sturdy, thick, and comfortable. Following these steps can help in building an ideal nest: a) Use six boards to construct the nest, which will provide the cover and floor, the left and right sides, and the front and back sides. Make sure the boards are not too slippery, so the birds can comfortably use the nest. b) Carve a small hole in the front of the nest to function as a \\"door\\". Ensure that the entrance is large enough for the birds to fly in and out without difficulty. c) The nest design should prevent rainwater from entering, keeping the inside dry and safe for the birds and their offspring. d) One of the boards should be easy to open, allowing for periodic inspection and maintenance without unnecessarily disrupting the birds. e) Color the nest with natural and non-toxic paint to blend in with the surrounding environment, providing comfort and safety for the birds. When we are watching birds, it is essential to: C) Hide ourselves to make the birds do everything as usual Choosing this option ensures that we are not causing any disturbance or stress to the birds. As observers, we should minimize any impact on their natural behavior, allowing them to go about their daily activities without disruption.

While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything.

Cheryl Tyler: Something Worth Fighting For Jan. 17, 2012, 6:34 a.m. In Principal’s Office, a regular feature of SchoolBook, a city school principal is interviewed for insights into school management and the life of a school leader. What do you think makes a good principal? Join the conversation below. When word got out in the fall that Public School 277 in the Bronx had landed on a list of schools that could be closed by the Department of Education because it had received an F on its progress report, the school’s students, parents and teachers went on a campaign to convince officials that their school had been working hard to raise achievement in the struggling neighborhood. They wrote letters. They crowded into meetings at the school auditorium. They described a school where students are engaged and teachers feel respected for their work. In December, when they learned that school officials had decided to keep the school open, “you could hear the resounding cheer throughout the school,’’ said Cheryl Tyler, the principal. Deputy Chancellor Marc Sternberg said, “We saw the school has a motivated principal and energized staff with a vision for improving student achievement.” Ms. Tyler, 64, who became a teacher in 1970, said she knows there is much work ahead. Her school, located in a cheerfully decorated building, has 529 students, 40 percent of whom are considered English language learners or classified as special education students. Ms. Tyler’s salary is 133,000 a year. You came here in 2006. What was the school like then? There was a very different vision of the school. Most of the teachers felt that their work was to ensure that kids were quiet and compliant and contained. And because of that — kids are very smart — many of the kids weren’t engaged. I think that the curriculum was not a curriculum that really mattered to the kids. It was certainly a school that had done some important work and some effective work and needed a coherent curriculum, and teachers needed to find a place that they felt they were really making a difference for the kids. And how would you describe P.S. 277 now? What I like to think now is that we’ve become a community of ideas. When we have a problem now, or we’re in some kind of crisis mode, we come together as a community. We think about it, we learn from that crisis and we try to figure out ways together to resolve it, because separately we cannot make our school better. Did you choose to come to this school? I did. I came out of the Leadership Academy. One of the goals of the Leadership Academy is to put their graduates in schools that are in need. Over my career I’ve taught in Harlem and the Upper West Side, and I’ve always felt that the important work — it’s all important work — but the really important work was teaching in Harlem, being in the South Bronx, being in the high poverty neighborhoods of Buffalo when I was in Teacher Corps. You got an F on your school progress report, after earning an A in 2009 and a C in 2010. How hard was it to hear that your school might close because of poor performance? It was devastating. It was devastating on a lot of levels. We know as a community what our kids are doing. We know how incredibly important those standardized tests are. We also know that it’s not enough for our kids to answer other people’s questions. We want them to be the ones asking the questions. We want them to also have the skills and the strategies and the kind of thinking that they need when those answers don’t make sense, to push back. Here, they’re always analyzing, they’re always theorizing, they’re always determining the validity of an argument. That’s really what we know our kids are doing. You see them in the morning with their noses in books. So it was devastating because we are working very hard to figure out what’s happening when our kids are taking those standardized tests because we know that they’re capable and we know that our teaching is effective and strong and powerful. They were devastated and constantly asking themselves: “What are we going to do? How are we going to ensure that the rest of the world sees us in light of what we’re doing because our test scores do not reflect the work that we’re doing.” What are you doing about that? We analyzed the data. We looked at our monthly assessments. We looked at our students’ writing, we hold it next to a rubric, we look at reading levels monthly. We look at math assessments monthly, and our social studies and science assessments in the context of common core standards. So we found a couple of things. One of the things, and this was a citywide pattern, but our kids in particular, need more work with nonfiction. We’ve implemented an additional half-hour a day of nonfiction, or reading in content in social studies. We’ve been given a gift of 8,000 nonfiction books by the Reading and Writing Project at Teachers College. Isn’t that throwing a lot at the problem? Every child is reading at a different level. For example, the fourth grade is studying civil rights. We don’t use textbooks, so we have to make sure that every child in the fourth grade has a book on his or her level, and not just one, but several. So it does seem like a lot, but you might need 20 books for one child. No, and the reason is that they’re ineffective when children are not all reading at the same level. You also said you’re doing more whole book assessments. What were you doing before? We were assessing our kids with short passages and asking them to retell the passage and to do inference work, and they were at grade level. But when it came to taking the test, they weren’t. We learned that the short text gave us a picture, but it wasn’t enough. We know a certain student, for example, can read two pages, and we know he can retell it and he can do some inferential work and theories about character development. What we didn’t know is whether in these books, can he accumulate information from chapter to chapter? Is he developing ideas as he moves through the chapters? Is he able to develop theories about characters? Those things now are being measured because we’re reading whole books. Have your methods changed? Is professional development more intense? One of the things we’re looking very closely at is I.E.P.-Special Education students and English Language Learners. Our children in general education were performing at about the city average on multiple choice questions. It’s our children who have I.E.P.’s (Individual Educational Plans) and the E.L.L.’s who we really, really need to take a close look at. That counts for 40 percent of our population. All our teachers are receiving really, really high-quality professional development from Teachers College and we have staff developers from there, and Lucy Calkins is deeply committed to our school; in fact she’s the one who sent us the 8,000 books. (Editor’s note: Lucy Calkins is the founding director of the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project.) What did it take to convince D.O.E. not to shut you down? I didn’t do anything except make it very clear to people that we had something worth fighting for, and I think they all believed that. Teachers are here because they see something bigger. They see that what we’re doing is not just teaching, that it’s more than just a job. They’re committed to something bigger. They felt that and there was an outpouring of e-mails. Some of the teachers’ parents even wrote. They said how proud they were of their kids and how committed their children were to being here and to the school and to the community. The people who supervise some of our student teachers from Teachers College wrote letters too, and parents and students wrote letters, too. You were devastated at first. Has that turned into a feeling of determination? You said it perfectly. We’re extraordinarily relieved and grateful that the work we’re doing is appreciated and that it was seen. We were under a lot of scrutiny and we felt that people really understood what we were doing, the people who were making those decisions. And now it’s, “O.K., deep breath.” Maria Newman is the community editor for SchoolBook. Follow her on Twitter @newmaria.

Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Packers the Eagles flew to Ford Field for an NFC Duel with the Lions. The Lions looked good early In the first quarter, but with 11:15 remaining, Shaun Hill was intercepted by Nate Allen. Just four plays into the following drive, the Eagles took the early lead when QB Michael Vick bombed a 45-yard TD pass to deep threat WR DeSean Jackson.Detroit replied, driving 76 yards in 6 plays with RB Jahvid Best hauling a 14-yard touchdown run, taking 3:00 minutes off the clock. After three combined punts, the Eagles then fell behind in the 2nd quarter when kicker Jason Hanson nailed a 49-yard field goal. This was followed by QB Shaun Hill slinging a screen pass to RB Jahvid Best, who took it 75 yards for a touchdown, widening the lead to 17-7. The possession took only three plays and barely a minute off the clock. Then the Eagles replied with an 11 play, 75 yard drive that ended with RB LeSean McCoy taking in a 14-yard TD run. After a Lions punt, the Eagles marched 89 yards in less than a minute with QB Michael Vick throwing a 9-yard TD pass to WR Jeremy Maclin. The Eagles led 21-17 at halftime. On their second possession of the third quarter, the Eagles scored again, with RB LeSean McCoy hammering home a 4-yard TD run. Things got worse for the Lions, as Shaun Hill was intercepted on their next possession by Ellis Hobbs. They managed to force a punt, but wasted a 12 play, 48 yard drive that took 5:49 off the clock. On 4th-and-1 at the Eagles 29, Jahvid Best was stuffed for no gain and the Lions turned it over on downs. Worse yet, the drive took into the fourth quarter. The Eagles seemingly put the game away on their next drive when LeSean McCoy scampered off to the races on a 46-yard TD run on 3rd-and-16 with just 6:27 left, and the Eagles lead 35-17. However, the Lions roared back with RB Jahvid Best finishing off an 85-yard drive with a 2-yard TD run, making the score 35-24 with 4:15 remaining. After forcing a three-and-out, the Lions stormed 56 yards in just 6 plays, culminating with Hill completing a 19-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson (With a successful 2-point conversion). The Lions recovered the onside kick with 1:50 left, but four straight incompletions ended any chance of a miracle comeback.

He knew that his happiness would only feel more meaningful if he could achieve something significant alongside it. So, he started his journey towards finding his passion and being more productive in his daily life. During his early days of introspection, Raul realized he had always enjoyed being close to nature. As a kid, he would often wander off into nearby forests and spend his time observing the birds and animals. This passion for nature had always been inside him, lying dormant. Once he realized this, Raul knew it was time to reignite that flame and use it as a catalyst for productivity. By combining his love for nature with his newfound drive to be productive, Raul started exploring opportunities to work with environmental organizations. He volunteered at a local animal shelter and signed up for workshops to learn more about conservation and wildlife protection. With each passing day, Raul could feel his satisfaction growing as he made a tangible impact on the world around him. Within a few months, Raul had gained considerable knowledge and experience in the field of environmental conservation. He soon came across an opportunity to help with a reforestation project in a nearby town. This project aimed to restore a patch of land that had been devastated by illegal logging activities. Raul was thrilled to join the project. He loved the idea of helping bring back life to the damaged area, and he saw it as the perfect opportunity to put his skills to the test and be even more productive. Starting early in the mornings, Raul and the other volunteers would plant saplings and care for the young trees, ensuring they had everything they needed to grow strong and healthy. They also built fences around the reforested area to keep away grazing animals, and collaborated with the local community to raise awareness about the importance of protecting the environment. Raul discovered that the sense of accomplishment he felt when he saw the saplings grow and thrive was truly unparalleled. Moreover, the friendships he formed along the way with like-minded individuals provided him with a sense of belonging and camaraderie. With each passing day, Raul felt more fulfilled. After months of hard work, Raul and the other volunteers finally saw the fruits of their labor. The reforestation project had successfully transformed a barren area into a lush, green haven for wildlife. As Raul looked around at the beautiful, thriving environment he and his team had created, he couldn't help but feel immense pride and satisfaction. Through his dedication to being productive and working towards a cause that he was passionate about, Raul had found a sense of fulfillment that went beyond fleeting happiness. He knew that he had made a lasting impact on the world and also, on his own life. In pursuing productivity, Raul had not only found purpose - he had also found lasting happiness. Now, whenever Raul thought back on his decision to chase productivity, he knew he had made the right choice. He was living proof that productive people felt fulfilled later on, and he couldn't wait to see what the future held in store for him.

An Iranian man should be sentenced to having his eyes gouged out after pouring acid over a young girl's face leaving her blind, an Iranian court has ruled.

The man was convicted last October of intentionally attacking the girl, haartez.com reported. President Hassan Rohani won a surprise election last year, after pledging more openness with the West. But an increased use of the death penalty has dashed hopes the country's will improve its human rights record, the UN said. The national council said Iran's high court defended cutting off the body parts of those found guilty of a crime, and removing eyes, as part of the country's judicial system. Last month, the state-run Mehr news. agency, reported another Iranian man was sentenced to have one hand and. one foot cut off as punishment for an unspecified crime. As many as 95 people are thought to have been executed in Iran this year. The dramatic rise in the use of the death penalty has dashed hopes for human rights reform under President Hassan Rohani, the United Nations said earlier this year. President Rohani won a surprise election last year, after pledging more openness with the West. In September, the country released dozens of political prisoners, prompting hopes Iran would improve their human rights record. 'There were some encouraging signs last year where political prisoners were released ... But it appears at least in the past seven weeks that in fact executions have been scaled up,' UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a news briefing. 'We regret that the new government has not changed its approach to the death penalty and continues to impose capital punishment for a wide range of offences. We urge the government to immediately halt executions and to institute a moratorium.' Last year Iran executed between 500 and 625 people, including at least 28 women and two children, Ms Shamdasani said.

These types of punishments, in which body parts are removed or mutilated, can be seen as a violation of basic human rights and have received widespread international condemnation. It is essential that Iran reevaluate its judicial system and reconsider the use of these harsh and inhumane punishments, especially when it comes to non-violent crimes and those committed by minors.

Write a title for this article: REPORTING FROM SEOUL -- In another corporate sputter for beleaguered Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp., the company announced Wednesday that it will recall more than 420,000 vehicles in the U.S. in connection with potential steering problems. The safety recall to replace what the company termed “the crankshaft pulley on the V6 engine” affects 550,000 cars worldwide -- 283,200 Toyota and 137,000 Lexus vehicles. The problem reportedly affects 38,000 cars in Japan and an additional 25,000 in Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, 14,000 vehicles face recall along with 10,000 in the Middle East and 14,000 in Asia outside Japan. There have been no reports of accidents or injuries related to the problems, Toyota said in a release from its American headquarters in Torrance, Calif. If not corrected, the outer ring of the engine's crankshaft pulley may become misaligned with the inner ring, causing noise or a warning signal to light up. The belt for the power steering pump may become detached from the pulley, making it suddenly more difficult to turn the driving wheel, the release said. Since September 2009, Toyota has issued more than 13 million product recalls in the U.S. alone. With the company facing hundreds of lawsuits, safety experts and industry analysts contend that quality problems could haunt the world's largest automaker for years to come, affecting both its reputation and bottom line. In February, Toyota announced that it would recall 2.17 million vehicles to correct mechanical defects that could cause them to accelerate out of control. The latest U.S. recall includes the 2004 and 2005 Camry, Highlander, Sienna and Solara, the 2004 Avalon and the 2006 Highlander HV. The Lexus recall affects the 2004 and 2005 ES330 and RX330 and 2006 RX400h, officials said. Starting in January, Toyota said, the company will mail owners a notification to make an appointment with an authorized dealer to have their cars inspected once a sufficient number of replacement parts have been produced. Meanwhile, consumers who detect any abnormal noises are asked to make an appointment to have the vehicle inspected, the release said. The company urged owners to with questions to visit the company's websites at www.toyota.com/recall or www.lexus.com/recall. They can also contact Toyota in the U.S. at 800-331-4331 or Lexus at 800-255-3987.

These loans were used to buy technology, equipment and raw materials needed for the industrialization of the country. Hypothesis: International creditors loaned the Democratic Republic of Romania some soft currencies.","completion":"Based on the given context, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"International creditors loaned the Democratic Republic of Romania some soft currencies\\" is true. The context provided specifies that the foreign debt of the Socialist Republic of Romania comprised loans made under Nicolae Ceaușescu from international creditors denominated in hard currencies. For a deeper understanding of the situation, let's delve into the distinction between hard currencies and soft currencies, along with the information available in the context. Hard currencies are those that are widely accepted around the world and easily convertible into other currencies. They usually come from nations with stable economies and lower levels of inflation and fear of devaluation. Some examples of hard currencies include the US Dollar, the Euro, the British Pound, and the Japanese Yen. The preference for hard currencies in international transactions is primarily due to their reliability in maintaining their value over time, unlike soft currencies. Soft currencies, on the other hand, are less stable compared to hard currencies. They often suffer from high inflation rates and devaluations and are not easily convertible into other currencies. These currencies are typically associated with developing and less economically stable countries. As a result, soft currencies are less desirable for international transactions since they carry a higher risk. Returning to the context provided, it is explicitly stated that the Socialist Republic of Romania borrowed funds from international creditors denominated in hard currencies. The primary purpose of these loans was to facilitate the purchase of essential resources such as technology, equipment, and raw materials to advance the industrialization of the country. Given the nature of international transactions and the risks associated with soft currencies, it is reasonable to assume that the loans were indeed made in hard currencies, which are more secure and reliable for international transactions. In conclusion, the given context only provides evidence for loans in hard currencies extended to the Socialist Republic of Romania. To support the hypothesis that international creditors loaned the Democratic Republic of Romania some soft currencies, we would need additional information suggesting such transactions took place. Until that evidence is available, we cannot draw the hypothesis that the Democratic Republic of Romania received loans in soft currencies from international creditors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences are discussing financial market indices, specifically referring to the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) index, which establishes a context of similarity. They both mention a decline in the respective indices, indicating a potentially negative market trend that could be of interest to investors watching these indices. However, there are significant differences in the details presented in each sentence, which is the reason for not rating the similarity higher than 2.5. 1. The first sentence is discussing the broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which tracks 500 large companies listed on US stock exchanges. It is focusing on the current value of the index itself and mentions a small decrease of 0.04 points, or 0 percent, ending at 971.52 points. This information provides a snapshot of the index's performance at a specific moment in time. 2. In contrast, the second sentence is discussing the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index futures, specifically for the month of June, which are financial contracts speculating on the future value of the S&P 500 index. This sentence also brings in comparison with Nasdaq futures, which are similar contracts for the Nasdaq Composite Index. Here, the S&P 500 futures are down 2.60 points at 965.70, and Nasdaq futures are down 7.50 points at 1,183.50. This information is providing insights into market participants' expectations about the future direction of these indices. To summarize, these sentences share common ground in discussing the S&P 500 index, but they approach it from different angles - the actual value of the index at the moment in the first sentence and the futures contracts speculating on the future value of the index in the second sentence. The introduction of Nasdaq futures in the second sentence further differentiates the content, resulting in a similarity rating of 2.5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The sentence structure and grammar are adapted to the Russian language, which uses the Cyrillic alphabet. Here is a breakdown of the translation: 1. Полиция (politsiya) – This Russian word directly translates to \\"police\\" in English. In both languages, this word is a noun that refers to law enforcement officers who maintain order and prevent crime. 2. снова (snova) – This adverb means \\"again\\" in English, indicating that the police had appeared previously and returned on the specified date. 3. появилась (poyavilas) – This verb derives from the Russian verb \\"появиться\\" (poyavit'sya) and is translated as \\"appeared\\" in English. The verb uses the feminine past tense form to agree with the noun (_politsiya_), since it is considered feminine in Russian grammar. 4. вечером (vecherom) – This adverb describes the timing of the police appearance as \\"on the evening\\" in English. The Russian language utilizes the instrumental case to indicate when something occurs. 5. 16 (шестнадцатое) (shestnadtsatoye) – This represents the numeral 16 in Russian, written in ordinal form. In the context of the sentence, this refers to the date, January 16. 6. января (yanvarya) – This is the Russian word for \\"January,\\" the first month of the year. The genitive case is used in Russian to clarify the date. In conclusion, the translation \\"Полиция снова появилась вечером 16 января\\" effectively mirrors the English sentence \\"The police appeared again on the evening of January 16\\" while adhering to Russian grammar and syntax rules."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Waste of time Review: Game has average graphics (I've seen better though), but that's about it.

The tweet is a response to a user with the handle @macwigout and refers to a family business, likely related to a location called \\"Shibley's\\" or \\"Victoria Pier.\\" To analyze the sentiment, we should consider the tweet's content and tone. Content-wise, the tweet is sharing personal or historical information about the author's family.

This suggests that the author is attempting to make a connection with @macwigout or the topic being discussed. In terms of tone, the tweet comes across as neutral, leaning slightly towards positive. Sharing a personal experience or family connection generally evokes positive feelings or pride. The tweet does not use any overtly positive language, but the fact that the person is sharing a piece of their family's history indicates a level of warmth.

Write a question about the following article: During the 9th century, Norway was divided between several local kings controlling their own fiefdoms. By the end of the century, King Harald Fairhair managed, mainly due to the military superiority gained by his alliance with Sigurd Ladejarl of Nidaros, to subjugate these mini-kingdoms, and he created a unified Norwegian state. This alliance came apart after Harald's death. The jarls of Lade and various descendants of Harald Fairhair would spend the next century interlocked in feuds over power. As well as power politics, religion also played a part in these conflicts, as two of the descendants of Harald Fairhair, Hakon the Good and Olaf Tryggvason attempted to convert the then heathen Norwegians to Christianity. In the year 1000, Svein and Erik of Lade took control over Norway, being supported by the Danish King Svein. In 1015, Olaf Haraldsson, representing the descendants of Harald Fairhair, returned from one of his Viking trips and was immediately elected as King of Norway. In June 1016, he won the Battle at Nesjar against the Jarls of Lade. Olav Haraldsson's success in becoming King of Norway was helped by the Danes being kept occupied with the ongoing fighting in England. In the year 1028, the Danish King Cnut the Great made an alliance with the Lades, and Olaf had to go into exile in Kievan Rus .

In a January 2010 interview with NME she spoke of being inspired by the film Food, Inc. and described the album as being about \\"exploring our faults and flaws\\" and being proud of them. The closing track, \\"Space\\", which was reportedly recorded using an iPhone app, is a ballad which Mikael Wood, writing in Billboard, described as \\"dreamy\\" and \\"sound[ing] like a Sega Genesis practicing its pillow talk\\". In contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described \\"Lovalot\\" as sounding \\"like it was recorded in a dank alley, the singer's voice reverberating amid percussion that sounds like doors creaking and rats scurrying across garbage cans\\". \\"XXXO\\" draws its inspiration from M.I.A.'s \\"cheesy pop side\\", and is based on the theme of the creation of a sex symbol. \\"Teqkilla\\" is the only track to address her relationship with Bronfman, through a reference to Seagram, the company owned by his family. \\"It Takes a Muscle\\" is a cover version of a track originally recorded in 1982 by Dutch group Spectral Display, and is performed in a reggae style.The opening track \\"The Message\\", featuring a male lead vocalist, parodies the words of the traditional song \\"Dem Bones\\" to link Google to \\"the government\\". Kitty Empire wrote in The Observer that these conspiratorial government connections to Google and the thoughts of Dzhennet Abdurakhmanova, the Russian teenager who bombed Moscow's tube system in revenge for the death of her husband, were inner-world issues pondered in \\"Lovalot\\" with \\"a mixture of nonsense rhyme, militant posturing and pop-cultural free-flow; her London glottal stop mischievously turns 'I love a lot' into 'I love Allah' \\".

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which plans to appeal , was given until May 28 to restore the old subway and bus fare and the old commuter railroad rates .","completion":"I will now examine both sentences to determine if they have the same meaning. Sentence 1: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority was given two weeks to restore the 1.50 fare and the old commuter railroad rates, York declared. Sentence 2: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which plans to appeal, was given until May 28 to restore the old subway and bus fare and the old commuter railroad rates. Step 1: Identify the subject Both sentences have the same subject: The Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Step 2: Identify the actions/verbs In both sentences, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was given a deadline to restore fares and commuter rates. Step 3: Compare deadlines Sentence 1 states the MTA was given \\"two weeks\\" to restore the fares and rates. Sentence 2 states the MTA was given \\"until May 28\\" to restore the fares and rates. Step 4: Compare the fares and rates to be restored Sentence 1 specifies these changes to be the \\"1.50 fare and the old commuter railroad rates.\\" Sentence 2 specifies these changes to be the \\"old subway and bus fare and the old commuter railroad rates.\\" Step 5: Identify any additional information Sentence 1: \\"York declared\\" - This tells us who provided the statement.

So how can I get meth to be flush out of body in 2 hours before a urine drug test? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"Hi there! I understand you have questions about getting meth out of your system. I'll do my best to explain this simply. First of all, it's important to remember that taking drugs can be harmful, and it's always better to avoid using them in the first place. Now, about your questions, they are about the same thing, like two friends asking how to clean a dirty shirt quickly. Both questions want to know how to remove something - in this case, meth - from the body. But the second question asks about doing it in 2 hours, while the first question doesn't say how quickly. The thing is, time helps our body clean itself, just like how water and soap help us clean that dirty shirt. Meth can stay in the body for different times for different people, but it usually takes at least a few days to get naturally cleaned up. So, unfortunately, there isn't a safe and sure way to get meth out of your system in such a short time. It's really important to stay away from drugs and make healthy choices to take care of our bodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Decide if you need to do it again with a negative result. Confirm a positive result with a doctor. Article:","completion":"Title: Understanding Home Pregnancy Tests: When to Take One, Interpret Results, and Confirm with a Doctor Introduction Home pregnancy tests have become the go-to option for women seeking to confirm a possible pregnancy. Easy to use, affordable, and accessible, these tests can provide an accurate response in just a few minutes. In this article, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of taking a home pregnancy test, determining if you need to take a second test due to a negative result, and finally, confirming a positive result with a healthcare professional. Step 1: Take a Home Pregnancy Test The first step in confirming a potential pregnancy is to take a home pregnancy test. Here's how to do it accurately: 1. Choose a reliable brand: When selecting a pregnancy test, opt for a well-known brand that has been trusted by many. This way, you can increase the accuracy of your results. 2. Read the instructions: Before using the test, make sure to read the instructions carefully. Each brand might have slightly different testing methods. 3. Timing is crucial: The best time to take a pregnancy test is one week after your missed period, as the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is present in higher levels in your urine during this time. 4. Use the first urine of the day: For the most accurate results, it is recommended to use the first urine sample of the day, as hCG concentration will be the highest. 5. Place the test on a flat surface, and wait for the recommended time (usually around 3-5 minutes) to read the results. Step 2: Analyzing the Results: Negative Test and Re-testing If the test comes back negative, there are a couple of factors to consider before deciding whether or not to take a second test: 1. Timing: As previously mentioned, timing is crucial when it comes to taking a pregnancy test. If you took the test too early, it might not have detected the hCG hormone leading to a negative result. In this case, it is recommended to wait a few days and take another test. 2. Test Sensitivity: Different tests have varying degrees of sensitivity when it comes to detecting hCG. If you doubt the accuracy of the first test, consider choosing one with a higher sensitivity and re-testing. Remember that while a negative result can bring relief or disappointment, it is essential to make an informed decision about re-testing based on the factors above. Step 3: Confirming a Positive Result with a Doctor Receiving a positive result can be exciting and overwhelming. To ensure the accuracy of the home pregnancy test and initiate proper prenatal care, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional. Here are the steps to follow: 1. Schedule an appointment: Upon receiving a positive result, contact your healthcare provider to schedule a prenatal appointment. 2. Blood test: A healthcare professional will perform a blood test to confirm the presence of the hCG hormone, providing a more definitive result compared to a home pregnancy test. 3. Ultrasound: If the blood test comes back positive, an ultrasound may be scheduled to confirm the pregnancy further and determine the gestational age. In conclusion, taking a home pregnancy test can be a crucial first step in confirming a potential pregnancy. By following the guidelines outlined in this article and consulting with a healthcare professional, you can ensure the accuracy of your results and embark on your pregnancy journey with confidence."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Take a few moments every day, and just pause. Sweep your gaze over your field of vision. Try to notice as many details as possible. This will train you to pay more attention to your surroundings. Pay attention to the people, objects, animals, plants, and buildings around you. Try doing this in a different place every day. Start at home, then try it at an office, park, mall, grocery store, or a local landmark. Often, people only notice the large objects that surround them. As you go throughout your day, try to look for the smaller details that might surround buildings, landmarks, and large spaces. For example, you might be at a store. What does the sign say? Is there anything on the windows? How many carts are lined up outside? If you're walking through a neighborhood, you might study the different mailboxes, lawn ornaments, plants, or toys out in the yard. It is easy to become distracted by electronics, intrusive thoughts, or noisy environments, but these can make you less observant. Rather than tune out your surroundings, try to focus on where you are in the moment. Instead of listening to music on your commute, describe your surroundings. On the bus, you might notice that there are five people on it, that the bus is making a rumbling noise, and that there is a musty smell. When you take a walk, listen to the sounds of nature, such as birds singing or the wind rustling through the trees. Think about how the sun feels on your skin or how brightly colored the flowers are. Do this throughout your day as you notice things. This will keep you observant in the moment. Write your observations in a journal or word document. Try to be as specific as possible. What did you see? Was it a certain color, size, or shape? Where was the object? How it was placed in relation to other objects? What kinds of sounds were going on around you? What types of sensations did you feel? Who was there? What were they wearing? What were they doing? When you're trying to observe something, try to identify how many of them there are. These numbers will force to you to pay more attention to the size or quantity of objects. As time goes on, you may be able to count objects more quickly. For example, instead of “I saw some kids playing outside,” you might write, “I saw four kids playing outside with one ball.” Instead of saying \\"I had to sign a bunch of documents,\\" keep track of what you did. You might observe that you signed your name four different times on two different documents.

We were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food, the attentiveness of the staff, and the warm, inviting ambiance of the restaurant. It truly was a remarkable dining experience that deserves every bit of praise it gets. From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with a charming setting that immediately felt welcoming and cozy. The soft lighting, tastefully decorated interior, and the gentle music in the background offered a perfect atmosphere for a romantic evening. One of the things that stood out to us was the exquisite menu. The Garden Bistro offers a great variety of dishes to choose from, including mouth-watering appetizers, main courses, and heavenly desserts. As a vegetarian, I was thrilled to see the extensive plant-based options available. It was clear that the chefs at the restaurant go above and beyond to ensure fresh, local ingredients are used in every dish. For our starters, we ordered the famous Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms and Truffled Cauliflower Soup. The mushrooms were cooked to perfection, filled with a rich and creamy blend of goat cheese and spinach. The soup, meanwhile, offered a delicate balance of flavors, with the truffle oil providing an elegant touch that left us craving for more. As for our main courses, I went with the Wild Mushroom Risotto, while my partner opted for the Seared Ahi Tuna. My risotto was creamy and bursting with the rich umami flavors of the wild mushrooms. The addition of asparagus and fragrant Parmesan cheese elevated the dish to a whole new level. My partner's Ahi Tuna was seared to perfection, creating a beautiful crust around the tender, flavorful fish. The accompanying Mango Salsa and Ginger Soy Glaze complemented the dish wonderfully, rounding out the Asian-inspired flavors. Finally, we couldn't resist indulging in one of their signature desserts, the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake. The cake was moist, warm, and gooey, with a decadent molten chocolate center that oozed out upon breaking through the delicate crust. Paired with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream, it was the perfect ending to our unforgettable meal. Throughout our evening at The Garden Bistro, the service was top-notch. The staff were attentive without being intrusive, and our server was genuinely friendly, offering helpful recommendations and ensuring our glasses were never empty. It's rare to find such a combination of outstanding food, ambiance, and service these days. In conclusion, our experience at The Garden Bistro was nothing short of exceptional.

Can you tell me the answer to when did free primary education start in kenya??","completion":"Free primary education in Kenya began in January 2003 when the Kenyan government, under the leadership of President Mwai Kibaki, introduced the Free Primary Education (FPE) policy. This policy aimed to alleviate the financial burden of education on families, improve access to basic education, increase enrollment rates, and reduce inequality among different socio-economic classes and regions. Kenya's education system before the Free Primary Education policy was characterized by low enrollment rates, high dropouts, and a considerable disparity in access to education based on factors such as socio-economic status, gender, and location. Education was not affordable for a significant portion of the population, and many children were either not attending school or forced to drop out due to financial constraints. The introduction of the FPE policy was a significant milestone in Kenya's education sector as it abolished tuition fees for primary education and allocated funding to primary schools based on student enrollment. This increased public spending on education by the Kenyan government, which was intended to help schools cover the cost of textbooks, teachers, and other essential resources required to provide a basic education. The implementation of the Free Primary Education policy led to a drastic increase in enrollment rates across the country. According to data from the World Bank, the net enrollment rate in primary education rose from 61.6 % in 2000 to about 95 % in 2004. This corresponds to an additional 1.2 million children enrolling in primary education within two years of the policy's introduction. While the introduction of free primary education in Kenya has significantly increased enrollment rates, the policy has also faced several challenges. These include inadequate infrastructure, a shortage of teachers, a lack of learning materials, and an increased demand for secondary education as more students complete primary education. Moreover, issues such as regional disparities and gender inequality still persist in Kenya's educational sector. In conclusion, free primary education in Kenya started in January 2003 as an essential policy intervention to improve access to basic education, increase enrollment, and address socio-economic disparities in the country. While it has had a noteworthy impact on primary school enrollment, various challenges remain, requiring further efforts to ensure equitable, quality education for all Kenyan children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:","completion":"Title: Lewandowski's Double Sends Bayern Munich Soaring into the German Cup Semi-Finals Introduction: Bayern Munich secured their place in the German Cup semi-finals with a commanding victory over 10-man Bochum, courtesy of a brace from star striker Robert Lewandowski. The reigning champions continued their pursuit of a record-extending 21st cup triumph, as they edged closer to yet another domestic double. Match Overview: In a match that displayed the full breadth of Bayern's attacking prowess, Lewandowski gave fans plenty to cheer about with his superb finishing. The Polish international opened the scoring for the visitors with a well-taken header in the first half, and later doubled his tally with a stunning volley. The hosts, Bochum, entered the game as substantial underdogs, and their uphill battle was made all the more difficult following an early sending off. Bochum's rocky journey throughout the match was ultimately compounded by Lewandowski's clinical expertise. Game-Changing Moment: The pivotal moment of the match came in the 20th minute when Bochum's defender was shown a straight red card for a challenge deemed dangerous by the referee. With the home side down to 10 men and facing relentless pressure from Bayern's attack, the chances of a miraculous upset quickly faded away. Lewandowski took full advantage of the situation, and just a few minutes after the red card, he rose highest to head home a pin-point cross from Kingsley Coman. The goal marked the beginning of an unstoppable performance from the 33-year-old forward. Adding Insult to Injury: Looking to compound Bochum's misery, Lewandowski put the result beyond doubt in the second half with an exquisite volley. The striker's second goal showcased his uncanny ability to find the net from seemingly any angle. The goal effectively snuffed out any hopes of a late comeback, ensuring that Bayern Munich comfortably advanced to the following round of the competition. Bochum's valiant effort in a challenging game, although admirable, proved insufficient against the reigning champions. Looking Ahead: With this victory, Bayern Munich solidified their position as the team to beat in the German Cup. Their eyes are firmly set on another domestic double, as they also attempt to maintain their lead at the top of the Bundesliga table. Meanwhile, Bochum will hope to use this experience to strengthen and develop their squad, looking to put in strong performances in their upcoming domestic league games. Conclusion: Bayern Munich's dominance in the German Cup continued, as Robert Lewandowski's deadly double guided them to a commanding victory against a 10-man Bochum side. With the semi-finals on the horizon, fans and pundits alike eagerly anticipate the draw to find out who will challenge the reigning champions en route to the coveted cup.

The Greenland Sea is often defined as part of the Arctic Ocean, sometimes as part of the Atlantic Ocean. However, definitions of the Arctic Ocean and its seas tend to be imprecise or arbitrary. In general usage the term \\"Arctic Ocean\\" would exclude the Greenland Sea. In oceanographic studies the Greenland Sea is considered part of the Nordic Seas, along with the Norwegian Sea. The Nordic Seas are the main connection between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and, as such, could be of great significance in a possible shutdown of thermohaline circulation. In oceanography the Arctic Ocean and Nordic Seas are often referred to collectively as the \\"Arctic Mediterranean Sea\\", a marginal sea of the Atlantic. - Geologically, a fjord or fiord is a long, narrow inlet with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. There are many fjords on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, Chile, Greenland, Iceland, the Kerguelen Islands, New Zealand, Norway, Novaya Zemlya, Labrador, Nunavut, Newfoundland, Scotland, and Washington state. Norway's coastline is estimated at with fjords, but only when fjords are excluded. - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - The Canadian Arctic Archipelago, also known as the Arctic Archipelago, is a group of islands north of the Canadian mainland. - Liverpool Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland. Geography. The peninsula is bounded by Scoresby Sund in the south, \\"Carlsberg Fjord\\" in the northwest, \\"Kangerterajiva\\" (Hurry Inlet) in the southwest, the Greenland Sea in the east, and Jameson Land in the west. It was named by William Scoresby, who thought that Hurry Inlet had a confluence with Carlsberg Fjord, separating Liverpool Land from Jameson Land. The fjord-rich peninsula is long from Kap Greville in the north to Uunarteq in the south, up to wide, and measures about in area.

The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - The Danish Realm is a realm comprising Denmark proper, The Faroe Islands and Greenland. - Greenland is an autonomous constituent country within the Danish Realm between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming. Although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press, most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years. - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places. - Inuit (pronounced or ; Inuktitut: , \\"the people\\") are a group of culturally similar indigenous peoples inhabiting the Arctic regions of Greenland, Canada and Alaska.

It was attached to the mainland of Liverpool Land by glacial ice even in 2002 , when the ice shelves began retreating rapidly in this area , so that by 2005 it was no longer attached to the mainland . Members of the scientific community believe this newly discovered island is a direct result of global warming . The island has three large peninsulas , and thus resembles the letter W. - Jameson Land is a peninsula in eastern Greenland. Geography. Jameson Land is bounded to the southwest by Scoresby Sound (the world's largest fjord), to the northwest by the Stauning Alps, to the north by Scoresby Land, to the northeast by the Fleming Fjord and the Nathorst Fjord of the Greenland Sea, and to the east by Carlsberg Fjord, the smaller Liverpool Land peninsula branching off, and Hurry Inlet. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Q: LucÃ­a (Paz Vega), a waitress, is talking on the phone with her depressed writer boyfriend Lorenzo (TristÃ¡n Ulloa) after they had a nasty argument, where, afterward, she walked out. Since he's been in a 'funk' for a while, she's worried, and goes home to console him. Finding an empty apartment, LucÃ­a is frantic. She receives a phone call from the police while finding a suicide note, and is so afraid of bad news that she hangs up, assuming the worst. They call back, but she ignores the ringing phone, packs a bag, and flees. Looking for a new beginning, LucÃ­a travels to the mysterious Balearic Islands that Lorenzo had always talked of, but had recently been very negative about.The plot breaks to six years earlier: Lorenzo is having casual sex in the ocean, on a bright moon-lit night, with a beautiful married woman he just met named Elena. They part ways, expecting to never see each other again. She discovers she is pregnant with his child, and attempts to find him, but, not knowing much about him, is unable to.Later, as Lorenzo talks with his literary agent at a restaurant, discussing his writer's block, LucÃ­a catches his attention as he gets up from his table to get cigarettes. She asks to speak to him and he joins her. She brazenly tells him that ever since she read his latest book, she has been following him and has fallen passionately in love with him. A smitten Lorenzo immediately engages the sexy, passionate LucÃ­a and she moves into Lorenzo's apartment.The film then interweaves the past and present, of the characters in the film, and the characters in Lorenzo's novel.Lorenzo repeatedly stalls for time on his new book with his editor, while his relationship with LucÃ­a deepens. About six years pass. Lorenzo learns he has a daughter as a result of his encounter with Elena and begins to visit the child at her school, meeting her babysitter BelÃ©n. BelÃ©n tells Lorenzo her mother is a recently retired porn actress with a new hot boyfriend, and virtually seduces Lorenzo with chatter of sexual context and banter about her fantasies. Lorenzo uses these encounters and his fantasies about BelÃ©n and her mother as content for his book, and LucÃ­a reads about it, thinking it fiction. Meanwhile, he does not disclose his fatherhood to LucÃ­a or the child, nor even attempt to contact Elena.BelÃ©n flirts with Lorenzo and eventually invites him over to Elena's house while she babysits his daughter, Luna. Lorenzo tells Luna a bedtime story, and after she falls asleep, he and BelÃ©n begin to have sex. They are interrupted as Luna knocks at the bedroom door, and they watch in horror as the family dog, a large Rotweiler in 'protect mode' kills Luna. BelÃ©n is stunned. Lorenzo runs away and falls into a deep depression.Lorenzo's writing turns dark, towards depraved sex and death. He anonymously contacts Elena, who has moved to the island to find solace and recall better days, and provides her a nice story about a beautiful child that loves to swim in the sea, to cheer her spirits. But his now guilt-ridden and uncommunicative relationship with LucÃ­a begins to collapse.Back in the present, LucÃ­a meets a scuba diver on the island, Carlos, and through him, Elena, who runs an inn on the island. LucÃ­a rents a room, and the women bond as friends, not knowing their intimate connection. But when LucÃ­a mentions Lorenzo by name, and his past visit to the island long ago, Elena deduces the connection. LucÃ­a sees a picture of Luna (looking remarkably like her father and remembering the name from Lorenzo's novel) and she makes the connection too.Lorenzo's editor visits Lorenzo in the hospital, where he was taken after being in an 'accident', spending several weeks in recovery. When Lorenzo asks about LucÃ­a, the editor tells Lorenzo he thinks LucÃ­a thinks he is dead. Lorenzo guesses LucÃ­a is on the island and has the editor take him there. After both women discover that Lorenzo isn't dead, the three characters cope with and finally understand the entanglements of their interwoven relationships., Question: The film is based on whose novel?

Researchers in psychology think that there are also two groups of people people who prefer warm colours and people who prefer cool colours. The warm colours are red, orange and yellow. Where there are warm colours and a lot of light, people usually want to be active. People think that red, for example, is exciting. Sociable people, those who like to be with others, like red. The cool colours are green, blue and violet. These colours, unlike warm colours , are relaxing. Where there are cool colours, people are usually quiet. People who like to spend time alone often prefer blue. Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colours than in a room with cool colours. He suggests that a warm colour, such as red or orange is a good colour for a living room or restaurant. People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colours are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly. Researchers do not know why people think some colours are warm and other colours are cool. However, almost everyone agrees that red, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue and violet are cool. Perhaps warm colours remind people of warm days and the cool colours remind them of cool days. Because in the north the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Where would you find a mom looking for an injured child to come home with her?\\" Context: \\"On Children's Day, June 1, 2008, many parents went to the rubble of schools to mourn for their children. The surviving children, who were mostly living in relief centres, performed ceremonies marking the special day, but also acknowledging the earthquake.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context of the tragic aftermath of an earthquake, particularly the one mentioned on Children's Day, June 1, 2008, a mother looking for her injured child to come home with her would likely be found in several key locations. These locations include relief centers, hospitals, temporary shelters, makeshift medical facilities, and the rubble of the schools and surrounding areas. Each of these locations possesses specific relevance to the situation and the desperate search for a missing or injured child. 1. Relief centers: Relief centers are usually set up in the wake of natural disasters like earthquakes, providing essential aid and support to the affected individuals and families. These centers often comprise temporary shelters, food and water, and medical assistance. A mother searching for her injured child may be at a relief center in hopes of reuniting with her child, who might be receiving care, supplies, or simply locating surviving family members. 2. Hospitals: It is likely that injured children would be taken to nearby hospitals, clinics, or makeshift medical facilities for treatment after such a catastrophic event. A mother looking for her injured child could be visiting these hospitals, going from one emergency department to another, inquiring and searching every ward, to find her child. Hospitals are an obvious location for a mother searching for her injured child to come home with her, as she would expect them to be receiving medical care or treatment. 3. Temporary shelters: These shelters are often set up in the aftermath of natural disasters to offer immediate accommodation to the displaced population. A mother searching for her injured child may visit temporary shelters in search of her child, hoping that they might have found temporary refuge in one of these shelters, or asking other people in the shelter if they had seen her child. 4. Makeshift medical facilities: In the aftermath of a large-scale disaster, local hospitals may become overwhelmed, necessitating the establishment of makeshift medical facilities to handle the increased demand for medical assistance. These facilities may be set up close to the epicenter of the tragedy, like in this case, the schools, where many children were buried beneath the rubble. A mother searching for her injured child might visit these makeshift medical facilities, frantically enquiring if her child was found and being treated there. 5. Rubble of the schools and surrounding areas: Lastly, a mother looking for her injured child might be physically searching the debris and rubble of the schools and areas impacted by the earthquake. With a heavy heart and determination, these mothers could be spotted scouring the remnants of the buildings and structures, sifting through the wreckage in search of any sign of their missing or injured children. Some parents would go to the rubble to mourn their children who lost their lives in the tragedy, while others cling to the hope of finding their child alive or recovering their remains. In conclusion, a mother searching for her injured child to come home would be primarily found in relief centers, hospitals, temporary shelters, makeshift medical facilities, and the rubble of the schools and surrounding areas in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake like the one that occurred on Children's Day, June 1, 2008.

The authorities have decided that the safety and well-being of all involved, including players and staff, can no longer be guaranteed amidst the escalating incidents of violence and disorder. Onlookers and loyal fans have witnessed the gradual deterioration of the stadium's atmosphere over the past few months. Tensions were already simmering between rival fan groups, leading to minor scuffles and verbal altercations during matches. But in the last few weeks, things have taken a drastic turn for the worse. It began as a series of isolated clashes between supporters, with tensions soon boiling over to create a hostile and dangerous environment at the Sevilla Stadium. Disgruntled fans from opposing teams have been engaging in large-scale brawls and hurling projectiles at each other. Disturbingly, some have even taken to vandalizing the stadium itself, inflicting significant damage to its infrastructure. The authorities and stadium management have been working tirelessly to de-escalate the situation. Enhanced security measures were implemented, and periodic public announcements were made, pleading with fans to behave responsibly. Unfortunately, these interventions failed to make a positive impact, with incidents continuing to occur with alarming regularity. The final straw came during the latest match, where an all-out brawl between fans broke out in the stands, leaving several people injured. As emergency services struggled to reach the injured spectators, the match was abandoned, and the stadium was evacuated. This shocking and chaotic event has confirmed the need for decisive action by the authorities. As a result, the decision to temporarily close the Sevilla Stadium has been made. The closure of the Sevilla Stadium comes with a heavy heart, as it represents a significant loss to the community and the world of football. Historically, the stadium has been a place of pride and unity, where fans gathered to support their favorite teams and revel in the excitement of the beautiful game. Sadly, recent events have sullied these fond memories, necessitating decisive action to restore order and ensure public safety. During the stadium's closure, the authorities will carry out investigations into the root causes of the crowd trouble, and further punitive actions may be taken against the responsible parties. The stadium's management will also be investing in extensive repairs and improvements to the facilities, ensuring that all safety regulations and guidelines are met. In the meantime, the affected teams will need to seek alternative venues for their matches, placing strain on the scheduling and logistics of the competition. It is hoped that these temporary measures will serve as a reminder of the values of sportsmanship and community spirit, and that the Sevilla Stadium can soon return to being the beloved heart of football in the region. The onus is now on football clubs, governing bodies, and fans themselves to come together in addressing the issue of crowd trouble at matches. A collaborative effort is needed to tackle not just the immediate security concerns but also the underlying societal issues that may contribute to such violent behavior. It is essential that necessary steps are taken to restore the peace, not just in Sevilla but in stadiums across the world, so that future generations can continue to enjoy the enthralling spectacle of football in a safe and enriching environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step-by-step justification of translation: 1. I started by identifying key terms and phrases in the original text and determined their Finnish translations: - Member States = jäsenvaltiot - broad union = laaja unioni - facilitate = helpottaa - smooth running = sujuva toiminta - internal market = sisämarkkinat - bound together = yhteen sidottuja - strong economic force = vahvana taloudellisena voimana - considerable economic output = merkittävä taloudellinen tuotanto - global trade = maailmankauppa - global GNP = maailman BKT 2. I then formed the sentences, making sure that the Finnish grammar and sentence structure are correct and that the translated phrases fit naturally. 3. I made some adjustments to ensure that the Finnish translation is coherent and fluent: - Instead of using a direct translation of \\"with\\" (kanssa) at the beginning of the sentence, I moved it after \\"11 jäsenvaltion\\" to form \\"11 jäsenvaltion kanssa\\" which flows better in Finnish. - Changed \\"are bound together\\" to \\"ovat yhteen sidottuja\\", which is a more accurate and natural translation in Finnish. - Used the percentage symbols (%) instead of writing them out as words for global trade and GNP, as it is more common and succinct. 4.

Robert and Justin are both patients in the hospital who are suffering complications from their HIV infections.

After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will develop infections more frequently? Hint: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections.

There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.

Many of its early members were prominent Quakers involved in the American Revolution before the society was established.

After Martos, a GEO operator, is killed and infected encountering some of the infected, Owen uses religious mantra and rosary to hold him off in a room. It turns out that Owen is actually a priest sent by the Vatican to get a blood sample from a possessed girl named Tristana Medeiros, the same attacker from the end of the previous film. At the penthouse, Tristana is nowhere to be found. Larra, one of the GEO operators, finds a sample of her blood â the only one that the original priest took from her. Owen performs a religious rite, and the blood combusts, confirming that it is the blood he's looking for; however, Fernandez, commanding officer of the GEO team drops it, rendering it useless. Owen tells them that they must get a blood sample from Tristana herself. Jennifer's father, who was outside getting medicine for his daughter (the infected Jennifer from the first installment), manages to convince a firefighter to take him into the building. Three teenagers, Tito, Mire and Ori gain access to the building through the sewage system; however, police seal their exit. After the deaths of Larra, Jennifer's father, and the firefighter from attacks by the possessed, the two groups find each other. However, Tito has been bitten, and they restrain him and lock Mire and Ori in a room where their fates are left unknown. The group then finds Ãngela Vidal (Manuela Velasco), the reporter from REC, who still has her camera with her. Owen forces Tito to tell him where Tristana Medeiros is. The demon possessing Tito tells him that she is \\"in the highest.\\" Owen figures out that this means that she is in the penthouse.

He hitchhikes to his childhood home, a decrepit place now owned by Jeremiah. Run down as it is, it is the dream home for Wes Merritt and his wife Louise. They are painstakingly saving up the money to buy it from Wes's meager wages as a cowhand. Wes recognizes Jeff as a once-prominent rodeo rider, and introduces himself, then helps Jeff gets a job at the same ranch. Wes has competed in some local rodeos, but has the ambition to do more, and wants Jeff to help him improve his skills. Wes enters a local rodeo behind his wife's back. When he does well, he decides to join the rodeo circuit, with Jeff as his partner and trainer. Louise is wholeheartedly against the idea, but goes along. She makes her husband promise to quit once they have saved enough for the house. As Louise becomes acquainted with rodeo life, she becomes more and more disenchanted.

Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists.\\" He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members. Skinny Puppy is noted for theatrical and controversial live performances which blend performance art with music, especially in an ambitious period that spanned their Head Trauma (1987-1988), VIVIsectVI (1988), Too Dark Park (1990), and Last Rights (1992) tours. Ogre has been critical of the bands early performances, telling Spin magazine in 1992 that \\"I would do things on stage that would blow-they just wouldn't work\\". Live performances involved periods of musical improvisation, film projections, and elaborate stage props and machines, many of which are designed and built by Ogre himself. While discussing Skinny Puppy's performances, Ogre once remarked that \\"our shows combine images with theater. It works better than just coming out and doing a horror magic routine\\". On-stage theatrics included Ogre being suspended from racks and cables, play with a hangman's noose, Key cutting steel with an angle grinder, and mock executions of Ogre and George H.W. Bush. Following the 2004 Presidential Election in the United States, promoters began to ask the band to refrain from using fake blood during their performances. This reaction was prompted by the performance of a mock execution on stage, during which Ogre was decapitated by actors dressed as then U.S. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. The band was also asked by Samsung (who had been asked by Ogre to sponsor the band with a large flat screen) to \\"not insult the president\\" while performing on stage. In a 1987 television interview with Kim Clarke Champniss, Key explained that while Ogre follows a \\"rough guideline\\" during a live performance, a majority of his on-stage theatrics are thought up of spontaneously. Key told Champniss that Ogre's demeanor on stage could \\"range from just a sort of laid back kind of lurking to a rampant psycho\\". Ogre once remarked that touring was, for himself, like \\"dating hydrogen peroxide\\", referencing the numerous injuries which he would acquire over the course of touring. Though Ogre and Key have remained the only constant members of Skinny Puppy's live act since the death of Dwayne Goettel, several other musicians have been hired to accompany the pair since 2004. They include drummer Justin Bennett, guitarist William Morrison, and guitarist Matthew Setzer. Entity:","completion":"Skinny Puppy"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: In more than 15 years on the bench, Orange County Superior Court Judge M. Marc Kelly said, he had never run into a case like the 19-year-old child molester facing a minimum 25-year prison term. A jury had convicted Kevin Rojano-Nieto of sodomizing a 3-year-old girl who had wandered into a garage where he was playing video games, and the judge conceded the crime was despicable. But Kelly said he wrestled with the case and finally decided that giving Rojano-Nieto such a sentence — even though it was the mandatory minimum sentence under state law — would be \\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\" So he gave him 10 years instead. The judge's decision has landed him at the center of a growing firestorm. On Thursday, three Orange County supervisors called on him to resign, thousands signed petitions condemning his actions and conservative talk show hosts revised their programming to discuss the case and news blog. Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas, meanwhile, said he plans to appeal the sentencing. More than 50,000 names have so far been added to a Change.org petition calling for his resignation, and a Facebook page titled Remove Judge M. Marc Kelly From the Bench page had thousands of likes. \\"He must have forgotten that his job is to protect the victim, not the perpetrator,\\" Supervisor Lisa Bartlett said at a Thursday afternoon news conference, describing the decision as \\"an unconscionable ruling\\" by an \\"activist judge.\\" News of the reduced sentence caused other victims to remember their mistreatment at the hands of judges, said Patricia Wenskunas, founder and chief executive officer of Crime Survivors Inc. \\"It is not right, it is not just, and we will not stand for it,\\" she said. Gesturing toward the towering court building behind them, Supervisor Todd Spitzer said Kelly had overstepped the bounds required of Superior Court judges by making law instead of following it. If Kelly does not resign, he said, the judge could be recalled. Kelly, who declined to comment Thursday, said during Rojano-Nieto's sentencing that he saw the defendant as being \\"extremely remorseful\\" and that a prison term stretching a quarter of a century would be \\"grossly disproportionate,\\" according to court transcripts. The judge said statements had shown that Rojano-Nieto was not a sexual predator but a confused young man raised in a fractured family. The young man, he said, had \\"inexplicably became sexually aroused\\" when the girl wandered into the garage but never intended to harm the child, a relative. He said Rojano-Nieto did not fit the classic definition of a predator. He also said the girl now \\"appears to be a happy healthy child.\\" \\"So it's hard to gauge how this crime may affect her mental state in the future,\\" he said. \\"It certainly may, but I hope it does not. It doesn't appear she suffered any serious violent physical injuries, and by all accounts she appears headed for a normal life.\\" At the time of the crime, Rojano-Nieto was working as a grocery store bagger and lived in a Santa Ana home with at least five other children, according to court documents. A high school graduate, he told the court he had aspirations of joining the military. \\"It has been not only extremely difficult, but utterly devastating for me and my family to fully come to terms with the events that took place,\\" a relative of both the girl and defendant wrote in a statement that her husband read to the court during a hearing in February. \\"It has rocked the very foundation of my family to the core.\\" Rojano-Nieto, who is now 20, also spoke before he was sentenced. \\"Despite my actions and what people might say about me, that is not what is in my heart. Regardless about what people say about me, that is not who I am.\\" Times staff writer Veronica Rocha contributed to this report. ||||| [UPDATE 08/20/15 – OFFICIAL SIGNATURE GATHERING EVENT TO REMOVE JUDGE KELLY IS TODAY!!! PLEASE JOIN US! Sign an official petition at the Ayres Hotel Orange, located at 200 N.

VISIT: HTTP://WWW.RECALLJUDGEMARCKELLY.COM] A convicted child rapist didn't mean to hurt the toddler he sodomized. The rapist didn't commit an act of violence. The child rapist didn't callously disregard the three year old he anally raped. At least, that's what Judge M. Marc Kelly of Orange County Superior Court in California would have you believe. On Friday, April 3rd, 2015, Judge Kelly used his judicial discretion to sentence convicted rapist Kevin Jonas Rojano to 10 years in prison for sodomizing a 3 year old female child. That is 15 years *less* than the mandatory minimum sentence for such a crime. He stated that imposing the mandatory sentence would amount to \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\" for Rojano. Judge Kelly felt that this particular child rapist deserved less of a sentence than other child rapists get. He is quoted as saying this: \\"Although serious and despicable, this does not compare to a situation where a pedophilic child predator preys on an innocent child.\\" He further stated, \\"there was no violence or callous disregard for (the victim's) well-being.\\" Judge Kelly continued, \\"In looking at the facts of Mr. Rojano’s case, the manner in which this offense was committed is not typical of a predatory, violent brutal sodomy of a child case.\\" Judge Kelly further showed empathy with the rapist in this case by stating, \\"Mr. Rojano did not seek out or stalk (the victim). He was playing video games and she wandered into the garage. He inexplicably became sexually aroused but did not appear to consciously intend to harm (the victim) when he sexually assaulted her.\\" He added that the rapist \\"almost immediately\\" stopped his actions and \\"realized the wrongfulness of his act.\\" Judge Kelly made these remarks knowing the 3 year old girl suffered tissue injuries to her anus as a result of the sodomy she endured. He also made these comments knowing Rojano covered the little girl's mouth to remain undetected while her mother frantically looked for her. ... Something must be done ... Despite Judge Kelly's statements, *any* rape is violent, and imposing such a light sentence on the perpetrator of this violent act is itself a callous disregard for the victim. Despite Judge Kelly's statements, the sodomy of a 3 year old girl is predatory, brutal, and violent in its very nature, and any circumstances surrounding the action do not change this fact. Despite Judge Kelly's statements, \\"almost immediately\\" stopping is little too late for the helpless victim, who was raped the moment she was penetrated by Rojano. Judge Kelly's statements are nothing short of reprehensible. It is clear that Judge Kelly's empathy towards the perpetrator of this horrific crime has clouded his judgment. Mandatory minimum sentences are created for crimes deemed so heinous that any sentence less than the mandatory would be unjust. Judge Kelly has taken it upon himself to impose a sentence that is just that: unjust. I call on Judge Kelly to do the right thing and step down from his official position OR FACE A RECALL. I call on the State of California Commission on Judicial Performance to open an official inquiry into Judge Kelly's actions to determine what discipline may be necessary in light of his words and in light of the unjust sentence he imposed in this case. What Judge Kelly has done has severely and permanently damaged any public trust in him. It calls into question whether he can impose any future judgments fairly, and it calls into question his past judgments. [Update] Some Change.org readers have noted that this isn't the first time Judge Kelly has handed down a lenient sentence for a sex offense. In the prior instance, a California Highway Patrol officer was handed probation. (See http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-03-25/news/moxley-confidential-chp-stephen-deck/) [Update] The US District Attorney's Office in Santa Ana, California has officially appealed the case!

Context: As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

It is likely he met both Burlington—the aristocratic architect at the forefront of the Palladian revival movement in England—and William Kent in Italy in 1715, and that in the home of Palladianism the idea of the mansion at Holkham was conceived. Coke returned to England, not only with a newly acquired library, but also an art and sculpture collection with which to furnish his planned new mansion. However, after his return, he lived a feckless life, preoccupying himself with drinking, gambling and hunting, and being a leading supporter of cockfighting. He made a disastrous investment in the South Sea Company and when the South Sea Bubble burst in 1720, the resultant losses delayed the building of Coke's planned new country estate for over ten years. Coke, who had been made Earl of Leicester in 1744, died in 1759—five years before the completion of Holkham—having never fully recovered his financial losses. Thomas's wife, Lady Margaret Tufton, Countess of Leicester (1700–1775), would oversee the finishing and furnishing of the house.Although Colen Campbell was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by Matthew Brettingham, under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the Civil War, when it was introduced by Inigo Jones. However, following the Restoration it was replaced in popular favour by the Baroque style. The \\"Palladian revival\\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect Andrea Palladio. However it did not adhere to Palladio's... contains an answer for the question: What were the last names of the two people Coke met in Italy?, what is it ?

Santamental, released in October 2003, is a collaborative project featuring several prominent musicians such as guitarists Eddie Van Halen, Slash, Steve Vai, and drummer Gregg Bissonette. When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures. He said of the album, \\"But I never dreamt in a million years that I'd do a Christmas record.\\"The musicians Lukather chose for Santamental, most of whom were involved in the hard-rock genre, lent a heavy feel to the album. Van Halen recorded guitar tracks for \\"Joy to the World\\" after not having been in the studio for some time but immediately made an impression on Lukather with his level of playing. Vai provided guitar work for \\"Carol of the Bells\\" along with Lukather's son Trevor, then 14 years old. Slash, who recorded his part in one take, played on the Lukather/Stan Lynch composition \\"Broken Heart for Christmas\\". Lukather spoke highly of Slash after the project, calling him the \\"Keith Richards of our generation\\". Well-known session guitarist Michael Landau played on the song \\"Look Out For Angels\\", and there is a version of \\"Jingle Bells\\" featuring a big band and sung by Sammy Davis, Jr. Santamental was recorded in six days, after which Lukather proclaimed it \\"his first and last Christmas album\\".

Choose from: -unacceptable -acceptable","completion":"A linguist would most likely rate the sentence \\"John sounded happy\\" as acceptable linguistically. Here is a detailed analysis of why this sentence is considered linguistically acceptable: 1. Syntax: The sentence follows the basic syntactic structure of subject-verb-object (SVO) that is typical for English sentences. In this case, \\"John\\" is the subject, \\"sounded\\" is the verb, and \\"happy\\" is the object. 2. Verb usage: The verb \\"sounded\\" is a linking verb which is used to describe properties and states of the subject rather than actions. It connects the subject, \\"John,\\" with additional information about him, which in this case is \\"happy.\\" The use of the verb in this sentence is correct. 3. Predicate: \\"Happy\\" is an adjective used as the predicate in this sentence. The purpose of a predicate is to provide more information about the subject. In this case, \\"happy\\" is used to describe John's emotional state. The use of the adjective as a predicate is grammatically correct and adds meaningful information to the sentence. 4. Clarity: The sentence is clear and concise, conveying a simple yet specific idea about John's emotional state. The meaning is easy to understand for speakers of English. 5. Punctuation: The sentence starts with a capital letter, as is appropriate for proper nouns like names, and ends with a period. This demonstrates correct punctuation use for a standard, declarative sentence in English. 6. Semantics: The sentence is semantically sound, as the words \\"John,\\" \\"sounded,\\" and \\"happy\\" are all used appropriately according to their meanings. Based on these factors, a linguist is likely to consider the sentence \\"John sounded happy\\" as linguistically acceptable. This judgement is made with the understanding that languages are dynamic, and there might be contextual or cultural variations that can affect acceptability, but generally, this sentence complies with the standard grammar and syntactic rules of the English language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

About 1150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming. Some of these species are cryptoendoliths as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanized cells make them resistant to UV light. Those features can also be observed in algae and cyanobacteria, suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as Cryomyces minteri. Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.

Here is a news article: WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department announced a 5 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs over the sale of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. The deal announced Monday resolves state and federal probes into the sale of shoddy mortgages before the housing bubble and economic meltdown. It requires the bank to pay a 2.4 billion civil penalty and an additional 1.8 billion in relief to underwater homeowners and distressed borrowers, along with 875 million in other claims. The agreement is the latest multi-billion-dollar civil settlement reached with a major bank. Other banks that settled in the last two years include Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Goldman had previously disclosed the settlement in January, but federal officials laid out additional allegations in a statement of facts. ||||| (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has agreed to pay 5.06 billion to settle claims that it misled mortgage bond investors during the financial crisis, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Monday. The settlement, which Goldman disclosed in January, stems from the firm’s conduct in packaging, securitization, marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007, the Justice Department said. Investors suffered billions of dollars in losses from the securities bought during the period, the department said. The settlement comprises a 2.385 billion civil penalty and 1.8 billion in other relief, including funds for homeowners whose mortgages exceed the value of their property, as well as distressed borrowers. It also preserves the government’s ability to bring criminal charges against Goldman and does not release any individuals from potential criminal or civil liability, the Justice Department said. In addition, Goldman will pay 875 million to resolve claims by the New York and Illinois attorneys general, the National Credit Union Administration and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Chicago and Seattle. A state and federal working group formed to investigate wrongdoing in the pre-financial crisis mortgage-backed securities market negotiated the settlement, said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. The group has reached settlements with five other major financial institutions since 2012: J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM.N) (13 billion), Bank of America (BAC.N) (16.6 billion), Citibank (C.N) (7 billion) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) (3.2 billion). “We are pleased to put these legacy matters behind us,” a Goldman spokesman said in a statement. “Since the financial crisis, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our culture, reinforce our commitment to our clients, and ensure our governance processes are robust,” he said. Goldman also acknowledged a Justice Department statement of facts describing how the firm misled investors. For example, Goldman’s due diligence for one issue of 2006 mortgage-backed securities showed that some of the loan pools reflected an “unusually high” percentage of loans with credit and compliance defects, the Department said. Slideshow (4 Images) “How do we know that we caught everything?” asked a Goldman committee tasked with reviewing and approving mortgage-backed securities, according to the Justice Department. “We don’t,” a Goldman manager said. “Depends on what you mean by everything? Because of the limited sampling... we don’t catch everything,” another Goldman manager said. Still, the committee approved the securities without requiring additional due diligence, said the Justice Department, which did not identify those involved. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The U.S. Department of Justice announced a 5 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs over the sale of mortgage-backed securities leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.

Some crop tops fall to just below the bra-line, while others stop right above the belly button. Longer crop tops can cover most of the belly and just leave a small strip of skin above your waistband.","completion":"When considering how to wear crop tops, it is essential to choose a crop top length that best suits your personal style and body type. Crop tops come in various lengths, offering a multitude of options for pairing and coordinating with different wardrobe items. By taking your individual preferences into account, you will ensure you feel comfortable and fashionable in your chosen attire. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to effectively wear crop tops: 1. Know your body type: Understanding your body type will help you select a crop top length that flatters your figure. Apple-shaped or hourglass body types may prefer longer crop tops, while pear-shaped or athletic body types might look best in shorter styles. 2. Choose a crop top style: Crop tops come in various styles, including tank tops, short sleeve, long sleeve, and off-the-shoulder designs. Choose a style that complements your existing wardrobe and the outfits you plan to wear with your crop top. 3. Coordinate with high-waisted bottoms: Pairing a crop top with high-waisted bottoms, such as jeans, shorts, skirts, or leggings, will help elongate your legs and create a balanced look. Plus, high-waisted pants or skirts can offer more coverage for your midsection. 4. Layer your outfit: If you're not comfortable showing too much skin, consider wearing a cropped jacket, cardigan, or blazer over your crop top. Layering can add depth and sophistication to your outfit while providing additional coverage. 5. Experiment with patterns and textures: Don't be afraid to mix and match different patterns or textures when wearing a crop top. Combining a bold patterned crop top with solid-colored pants can create a trendy, eye-catching look. Alternatively, playing with textures like lace, velour, or ribbed materials can add visual interest to your outfit. 6. Pay attention to proportions: Create a balanced outfit by ensuring that your top and bottom proportions complement each other. For instance, if you’re wearing a looser, flowing crop top, try pairing it with slim or fitted bottoms. Conversely, a tight crop top can be balanced with loose or wide-leg pants. 7. Accessorize: Complete your crop top look with appropriate accessories. Depending on the occasion and your personal style, you may choose necklaces, bracelets, earrings, belts, or even hats to accentuate the overall attire. The right accessories can enhance your crop top ensemble and bring out your signature style. 8. Adapt your attire to the occasion: Different events and environments call for different styles. Dress your crop top up or down according to the occasion. For a casual day out, pair it with jeans or shorts, and for a night out or a more formal event, try a high-waisted skirt or tailored pants. 9. Consider wearing a bralette: If you're unsure about what type of bra to wear with your crop top, opt for a stylish bralette. Not only are they comfortable, but they're also designed to be seen, so even if it peeks out from your crop top, it'll look intentional and chic. 10. Confidence is key: The most important aspect of wearing a crop top is feeling confident and comfortable in your outfit. Embrace your chosen style, and don't be afraid to make a statement. Remember, fashion is an expression of your personality, and the more confident you feel, the better you'll appear in any attire. By following these tips, you can successfully incorporate crop tops into your wardrobe, experiment with various lengths and styles, and create fashionable and comfortable outfits suitable for any occasion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer to this question? who sings the lion sleeps tonight original version?","completion":"The original version of the song \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" is credited to South African musician Solomon Linda, who recorded the song with his group The Evening Birds in 1939. This rendition of the song was titled \\"Mbube\\" (pronounced mm-boo-bay), which means \\"lion\\" in the Zulu language. Born in Pomeroy, South Africa, Solomon Linda was a singer-songwriter and a pioneering figure in the South African music scene. His unique and innovative style later paved the way for various forms of African music to gain global recognition. The melody of \\"Mbube\\" was inspired by childhood experiences in the countryside, where Solomon and his friends would chase away lions sneaking up on their cattle. The song \\"Mbube\\" became immensely popular in South Africa, selling over a hundred thousand copies within a few years. It marked the commencement of the era of commercially released African music. The song's success later extended beyond South Africa, attracting interest from the United States and other parts of the world. In the 1950s, the American folk singer Pete Seeger discovered \\"Mbube\\" and recorded a version of the song called \\"Wimoweh,\\" with his band The Weavers. The song became a hit for the band, yet Solomon Linda remained uncredited and uncompensated for his work. Over the years, \\"Wimoweh\\" underwent numerous adaptations by various artists, eventually resulting in the 1961 hit version titled \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight,\\" recorded by the American doo-wop group The Tokens. Although Solomon Linda's song has been reprised and reinterpreted multiple times, it is his original version - \\"Mbube\\" - that stands as the foundation of what became a classic tune known and cherished by millions around the world. Fortunately, after a prolonged legal battle by his family, Linda's estate received a settlement and recognition for his creation and indelible contribution to the music industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Use evidence from the fact that as distance from an object decreases , the the pull of gravity on that object increases to answer the following question. Choose from options. \\"while passing Jupiter the\\" pick from the following. (a). better the view; (b). stronger the gravity; (c). moon orbits you; (d). gravitational force weakens;","completion":"From the given options, the correct answer is (b). stronger the gravity. To provide a detailed and long answer to this question, we will discuss the concept of gravity and its dependence on distance, and then show how it applies to the situation at hand. Gravity is the force of attraction that exists between any two masses. It is described by Isaac Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. This law states that the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: F = G × (m1 × m2) / r^2 where F is the force of gravity between the two objects, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between their centers. The inverse square relationship between force and distance means that as the distance between two objects decreases, the force of gravity between them increases. Conversely, as the distance increases, the force of gravity decreases. This relationship applies not just to objects on Earth, but also to celestial bodies like planets, stars, and moons. Now, let's consider the question at hand. While passing Jupiter, we want to determine the effect of Jupiter's gravity on an object as the distance from the planet decreases. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a mass of approximately 1.898 × 10^27 kg. This enormous mass results in a strong gravitational pull. As an object moves closer to Jupiter, the distance between the object and the planet decreases. According to the Law of Universal Gravitation, this decrease in distance results in an increase in the force of gravity acting on the object due to Jupiter's mass. Therefore, the statement - \\"while passing Jupiter, the stronger the gravity\\" - accurately reflects the situation. As the object gets closer to Jupiter, the pull of gravity on that object increases due to the inverse square relationship between force and distance. Consequently, the gravitational force acting on the object becomes stronger. In conclusion, while passing Jupiter, the stronger the gravity best describes the relationship between the distance from the planet and the force of attraction between the object and Jupiter. As the object gets closer to Jupiter, the gravitational force it experiences increases, resulting in a stronger pull. This finding demonstrates the inverse square relationship between force and distance in the Law of Universal Gravitation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sicily is a melting pot of a variety of different cultures and ethnicities, including the original Italic people, the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Saracens, Normans, Swabians, Aragonese, Lombards, Spaniards, French, and Albanians, each contributing to the island's culture and genetic makeup. About five million people live in Sicily, making it the fourth most populated region in Italy. In the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities. The most recent ISTAT figures show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total of almost 5.1 million population (nearly 3.5% of the population); Romanians with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by Tunisians, Moroccans, Sri Lankans, Albanians, and others mostly from Eastern Europe.

By putting her life above his own, Xander displayed the kind of courage and empathy that is admired in people of all ages. The heart-wrenching event unfolded at a local pool where Xander noticed a fellow swimmer in distress. The young girl was struggling to stay afloat and seemed to be losing the battle against the water. Without hesitation, Xander swam towards her and managed to push her up above him so she could breathe more easily. As the girl regained her senses and found solid ground, it became increasingly evident that the helpful young boy had grown tired from his life-saving efforts. Tragically, Xander slipped under the water, unnoticed by others in the chaos that followed the rescue. By the time he was discovered lying motionless at the bottom of the pool, precious minutes had already slipped away. First responders immediately rushed Xander to a nearby hospital, where medical professionals tried desperately to save his life. He ultimately lapsed into a coma, leaving his family and friends praying for a miracle. Despite the immense efforts of the hospital staff and the unwavering support of his loved ones, Xander's condition did not improve. With heavy hearts, his parents made the difficult decision to take him off life support. Surrounded by the people who cared for him most, Xander passed away, leaving a legacy of bravery and selflessness that has touched the hearts of millions.

Когда вам нужно удалить загрязнение или пятно с тканевой поверхности, к примеру, затруднительно сделать это без дополнительных инструментов и чистящих средств. Один из способов, который можно использовать для того чтобы избавиться от таких нежелательных элементов на фабрике, — это применение старой зубной щетки в сочетании с моющим веществом, также называемым \\"пастой\\". Вначале необходимо подготовить работу с поверхностью. Если вы еще не определили, что реагирует на моющее вещество на данной тканевой основе, рекомендуется сначала как следует протестировать реакцию на малозаметном участке ткани. Далее, вам понадобится старая зубная щётка, которую можно использовать без опасения повредить ткань. Важно заранее испытать степень жесткости щетины зубной щетки, чтобы избежать разрывов и излишнего истирания волокон на поверхности ткани. Следует учитывать, что назначение щетки здесь не совсем традиционное: ее применение в этом контексте предполагает нанесение мягкого, равномерного давления на материал. Приступив к очистке, возьмите зубную щетку и аккуратно нанесите на неё небольшое количество моющего средства. Многие чистящие пасты имеют слабоабразивное действие и некоторые агрессивные составляющие. Вот почему прежде чем применить пасту, необходимо точно изучить состав и инструкцию к препарату, удостоверившись в том, что он безопасно взаимодействует с тканью. Используя зубную щётку с нанесенной на неё пастой, втерите её в ткань. Проведите эту процедуру с лёгкостью, аккуратно перемещая щетку волокон ткани, затем оставьте материал, чтобы паста проникла внутрь на глубину волокон. Это позволит активным веществам очистить поверхность от загрязнения и возможных пятен. После 20 минут подействия моющего средства, необходимо аккуратно промыть ткань водой, чтобы полностью удалить остатки пасты. Это гарантирует, что поверхность будет чистой, без следов загрязнений и пятен. В завершении можно использовать полотенце, чтобы снять излишки влаги, и оставить ткань высохнуть на протяжении некоторого времени. Для этой цели лучше всего подойдет хорошо вентилируемое место, где влажность быстро испарится, а ткань приобретет свежий вид."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The reviewer was clear in expressing their concerns and discontentment with the manager's rudeness and unwillingness to accommodate guests, as well as maintaining a condescending tone.

Guyana, officially known as the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, is a country located on the northeastern coast of South America, although it is often considered to be a part of the Caribbean region due to its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with other Caribbean nations and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). It shares borders with Venezuela to the west, Brazil to the south, and Suriname to the east. Georgetown, the capital and largest city of Guyana, is situated along the country's Atlantic coast, specifically on the eastern bank of the Demerara River's mouth. Established in the early 1800s by the British, Georgetown was initially called \\"Stabroek\\" before its name was changed in 1812 to honor King George III. Georgetown enjoys a unique mix of colonial architecture, rich cultural heritage, and diverse demographics due to its long history with the Dutch, French, and British colonial powers. Georgetown serves as Guyana's political, economic, and cultural center, hosting various ministries, government agencies, diplomatic missions, and organizations, such as the Guyana Parliament Building, the Supreme Court of Guyana, and the seat of the Presidency. Besides these, the city is also home to the University of Guyana and the Guyana National Museum, which showcase the nation's history, culture, and achievements. Guyana's economy primarily depends on agriculture, mining, and forestry, with rice, sugar, gold, bauxite, and timber being major products.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. In which case the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, case A or case B? Greg is an electrical engineer. He works for an engineering firm that builds houses. Yesterday, Greg was checking two of the houses. He noticed that one of the houses had short circuit. He labeled that as case A. But the other house didn't have short circuit. He labeled that as case B. Hint: In the wiring of a building, the wires carrying the current in and out are different and never touch directly. The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit . In a short circuit, some or all of the resistance is cut out of the circuit allowing the voltage to push a huge current through the wires. Answer:","completion":"The incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other in case A. As given in the paragraph, Greg is an electrical engineer who works for an engineering firm that builds houses. He was checking two of the houses and noticed that one of the houses had a short circuit, which he labeled as case A. The other house did not have a short circuit, and he labeled that as case B. A short circuit occurs when the wire carrying current in comes into direct contact with the wire carrying current out or the ground wire, bypassing the resistor or appliance that is meant to limit the amount of current flowing through the circuit. This causes a massive amount of current to flow through the wires due to the reduced resistance in the circuit, which can lead to damage or even fire. Based on the information provided, we can infer that it is in case A where the incoming and outgoing current wires would touch each other, as that is the house with the short circuit. In case B, the house did not have a short circuit, which means that the incoming and outgoing wires did not come into direct contact with each other. In this scenario, the wiring is presumably correctly set up, with resistors or appliances ensuring a proper level of electrical current throughout the circuit for safety purposes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:Tests in rats, reported in Stem Cells Translational Medicine, showed the human cells could restore some vision to completely blind rats. The team at University College London said similar results in humans would improve quality of life, but would not give enough vision to read. Human trials should begin within three years. Donated corneas are already used to improve some people's sight, but the team at the Institute for Ophthalmology, at UCL, extracted a special kind of cell from the back of the eye. These Muller glia cells are a type of adult stem cell capable of transforming into the specialised cells in the back of the eye and may be useful for treating a wide range of sight disorders. In the laboratory, these cells were chemically charmed into becoming rod cells which detect light in the retina. Injecting the rods into the backs of the eyes of completely blind rats partially restored their vision. Brain scans showed that 50% of the electrical signals between the eye and the brain were recovered by the treatment. One of the researchers, Prof Astrid Limb, told the BBC what such a change would mean in people: \\"They probably wouldn't be able to read, but they could move around and detect a table in a room. \\"They would be able to identify a kettle and cup to make a cup of tea. Their quality of life would be so much better, even if they could not read or watch TV.\\" The cells might be able to help patients with disorders such as macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa. Human stem cell trials are already taking place using material taken from embryos. However, this is ethically charged and takes several months to prepare the cells. The Muller glia cells can be ready within a week. Prof Limb commented: \\"They are more easily sourceable and very easy to handle in the lab so from that perspective they're better, but they do express antigens that could induce an immune response.\\" It means the donated cells could be rejected like an organ transplant. The next step is to prepare the cells as a clinical grade treatment in order for human trials to begin. The researchers believe it could take three years before such a trial takes place. Dr Paul Colville-Nash, the regenerative medicine programme manager at the Medical Research Council, which funded the study, said: \\"This interesting study shows that Muller glial cells are another viable avenue of exploration for cell therapy in retinal diseases. \\"It's not clear yet which approach will be most effective when these experimental techniques enter human trials, which is why it is important to progress research across all avenues in pursuit of a cure for sight loss.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"Researchers at University College London have reported in Stem Cells Translational Medicine that human cells were able to partially restore vision in completely blind rats.

FDA favors first drug for HIV prevention WASHINGTON – Federal drug regulators on Tuesday affirmed landmark study results showing that a popular HIV-fighting pill can also help healthy people avoid contracting the virus that causes AIDS in the first place. While the pill appears safe and effective for prevention, scientists stressed that it only works when taken on a daily basis. The Food and Drug Administration will hold a meeting Thursday to discuss whether Truvada should be approved for people who are at risks of contracting HIV through sexual intercourse. The agency's positive review posted Tuesday suggests the daily pill will become the first drug approved to prevent HIV infection in high-risk patients. FDA reviewers conclude that taking Truvada pre-emptively could spare patients \\"infection with a serious and life-threatening illness that requires lifelong treatment.\\" Despite the positive results, reviewers said that patients must be diligent about taking the pill every day. Adherence to the medication was less than perfect in clinical trials, and reviewers said that patients in the real world may forget to take their medication even more than those in clinical studies. First announced in 2010, Truvada's preventive ability was hailed as a breakthrough in the 30-year campaign against the AIDS epidemic. A three-year study found that daily doses cut the risk of infection in healthy gay and bisexual men by 44 percent, when accompanied by condoms and counseling. Another study found that Truvada reduced infection by 75 percent in heterosexual couples in which one partner was HIV infected and the other was not. The FDA's panel of advisers will take separate votes on whether Truvada should be approved for: — gay and bisexual men — men or women in relationships with HIV-positive partners — other people at risk of acquiring HIV through sexual activity The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its panels, though it usually does. An estimated 1.2 million Americans have HIV, which overwhelmingly affects men who have sex with other men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HIV attacks the immune system and, unless treated with antiviral drugs, develops into AIDS, a fatal condition in which the body cannot fight off foreign infections. Because Truvada is already on the market to manage HIV, some doctors currently prescribe it as a preventive measure. FDA approval would allow the drugmaker Gilead Sciences to formally market its drug for the new use. But support for FDA approval is not unanimous. Some researchers stress that condoms remain the best weapon against AIDS, and a prevention pill is not the chemical equivalent. \\"We know that if the person doesn't take the medication every day they will not be protected,\\" said Dr. Rodney Wright, director of HIV programs at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \\"So the concern is that there may not be adequate adherence to provide protection in the general population.\\" Wright, who is also chairman of the AIDS Health Foundation, added that some upcoming medications may be more effective at preventing infection than Truvada. Researchers also worry about Truvada's mixed success rate in preventing infection among women. Last year a study in women was stopped early after researchers found that women taking the drug were more likely to become infected than those taking placebo. Researchers speculated that women may need a higher dose of the drug to prevent infection. They also said the disappointing results may have resulted from women not taking the pills consistently. Still, many HIV patient advocacy groups say the drug should be a prescribing option to prevent HIV, alongside condoms, counseling and other measures. \\"If we're going to reduce the more than 50,000 new HIV infections in this country each year, we need to increase the available options for people,\\" said Ronald Johnson, vice president of AIDS United. He added that more studies are needed to determine the drug's effectiveness in women and other patient subgroups. \\"The current state of the data warrants going forward, but we believe additional clinical trials should also go forward to broaden the use of Truvada.\\" Last month, AIDS United and more than a dozen other advocacy groups sent a letter to the FDA, urging approval of Truvada. Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead Sciences Inc. has marketed Truvada since 2004. The drug is a combination of two older HIV drugs, Emtriva and Viread. Doctors usually prescribe the medications as part of a drug cocktail that makes it harder for the virus to reproduce. Patients with low viral levels are far less likely to develop AIDS. Side effects with Truvada include diarrhea, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. More serious problems can include liver toxicity, kidney problems and bone thinning. Company shares fell 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 49.34 What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The FDA is considering approving a pill called Truvada for people at risk of getting HIV through sexual intercourse.

Please answer the following question: Article: The ruins of Moore, Oklahoma, a town destructed for the fourth time in 14 years by a major tornado , are a reminder that current building codes can't do much to prevent property destruction and loss of life, especially when a powerful tornado cuts through town. But the total death number can be reduced when people take shelter in underground storm bunkers and hardened safe rooms. The tornado that carved a path of destruction through Moore took 24 lives. Its winds were clocked at 400 kilometers per hour. With only 15 minutes' warning, residents fled town or took refuge in the firmest corners of their homes. The luckiest were able to climb into shelters or move to safe rooms. In Moore those rooms saved lives. But at two schools destroyed by Monday's tornado, no such shelter was available. Leslie Chapman Henderson is CEO of a non-profit group called the Federal Alliance for Safe Homes. She's an advocate for tornado safe rooms. \\"The safe room is an interior room of the home that has been reinforced and tested to withstand high wind. In fact, we've already heard of stories of survival of people who were in safe rooms, either above or below ground,\\" she said. Better storm forecasts give people more time to react. But they need someplace safe to go. Buildings can be built to resist strong winds, but not like those in the F-5 tornado that touched down in Moore. Chapman Henderson says even the building codes that do exist are not widely adopted or enforced. As its residents prepare to rebuild, Moore's mayor is pushing for an order to make safe rooms compulsory in all new construction. Similar proposals were made following each of the previous tornado strikes, but none were adopted. Question: According to Chapman Henderson, which of the following does she probably agree with?

Answer the following question: Information: - An accident, also known as an unintentional injury, is an undesirable, incidental and unplanned event that could have been prevented had circumstances leading up to the accident been recognized, and acted upon, prior to its occurrence. Most scientists who study unintentional injury avoid using the term \\"accident\\" and focus on factors that increase risk of severe injury and that reduce injury incidence and severity (Robertson, 2015). - Death is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism. Phenomena which commonly bring about death include biological aging, predation, malnutrition, disease, suicide, homicide, starvation, dehydration, and accidents or trauma resulting in terminal injury. Bodies of living organisms begin to decompose shortly after death. - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974. - Lazarus of Bethany , also known as Saint Lazarus or Lazarus of the Four Days , is the subject of a prominent miracle attributed to Jesus in the Gospel of John , in which Jesus restores him to life four days after his death . The Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic traditions offer varying accounts of the later events of his life . In the context of the seven signs in the Gospel of John , the Raising of Lazarus is the climactic narrative : exemplifying the power of Jesus \`\` over the last and most irresistible enemy of humanity -- death . For this reason it is given a prominent place in the gospel . '' A figure named \`\` Lazarus '' ( Latinised from the Aramaic : , Elzr , cf. Heb. Eleazar -- \`\` God is my help '' ) is also mentioned in the Gospel of Luke . The two Biblical characters named \`\` Lazarus '' have sometimes been conflated historically , but are generally understood to be two separate people . The name \`\` Lazarus '' is frequently used in science and popular culture in reference to apparent restoration to life ; for example , the scientific term \`\` Lazarus taxon '' denotes organisms that reappear in the fossil record after a period of apparent extinction . There are also numerous literary uses of the term . - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus. - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books. - Malnutrition or malnourishment is a condition that results from eating a diet in which nutrients are either not enough or are too much such that the diet causes health problems. It may involve calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins or minerals. Not enough nutrients is called undernutrition or undernourishment while too much is called overnutrition. Malnutrition is often used specifically to refer to undernutrition where there is not enough calories, protein, or micronutrients. If undernutrition occurs during pregnancy, or before two years of age, it may result in permanent problems with physical and mental development. Extreme undernourishment, known as starvation, may have symptoms that include: a short height, thin body, very poor energy levels, and swollen legs and abdomen. People also often get infections and are frequently cold. The symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies depend on the micronutrient that is lacking. Undernourishment is most often due to not enough high-quality food being available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. A lack of breastfeeding may contribute, as may a number of infectious diseases such as: gastroenteritis, pneumonia, malaria, and measles, which increase nutrient requirements. There are two main types of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories) and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include: a lack of iron, iodine, and vitamin A. During pregnancy, due to the body's increased need, deficiencies may become more common. In some developing countries, overnutrition in the form of obesity is beginning to present within the same communities as undernutrition. Other causes of malnutrition include anorexia nervosa and bariatric surgery. Efforts to improve nutrition are some of the most effective forms of development aid. Breastfeeding can reduce rates of malnutrition and death in children, and... - Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life. During the samurai era in Japan, a form of...

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Johns is which band's primary songwriter? , can you please find it? In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Big Bird Cage is a 1972 American exploitation film of the \\"women in prison\\" subgenre. It serves as a non-sequel follow-up to the 1971 film \\"The Big Doll House\\". The film was written and directed by Jack Hill, and stars Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Anitra Ford, and Carol Speed. - A cinematographer or director of photography (sometimes shortened to DP or DOP) is the chief over the camera crews working on a film, television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image. The study and practice of this field is referred to as cinematography. Some filmmakers say that the cinematographer is just the chief over the camera and lighting, and the director of photography is the chief over all the photography components of film, including framing, costumes, makeup, and lighting, as well as the assistant of the post producer for color correction and grading. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia.

The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - Joe D'Amato (birth name: Aristide Massaccesi; 15 December 1936 in Rome 23 January 1999 in Rome) was an Italian filmmaker who directed roughly 200 films, usually whilst also serving as producer and cinematographer, and sometimes providing script-writing duties as well. While D'Amato contributed to many different genres (such as spaghetti westerns, horror, war movies, swashbucklers, peplums, and fantasy), the majority of his films are exploitation-themed pornography, both soft and hardcore. He is generally considered the most prolific Italian filmmaker of all time. - A gladiator (\\"swordsman\\", from , \\"sword\\") was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals.

The term applies to the depiction of the act rather than the act itself, and so does not include live exhibitions like sex shows and striptease. The primary subjects of pornographic depictions are pornographic models, who pose for still photographs, and pornographic actors or porn stars, who perform in pornographic films. If dramatic skills are not involved, a performer in a porn film may also be called a model. - An exploitation film is a film that attempts to succeed financially by exploiting current trends, niche genres, or lurid content. - Women in prison film (or WiP) is a subgenre of exploitation film that began in the early 1900s and continues to the present day. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Coffy is a 1973 American blaxploitation film written and directed by American filmmaker Jack Hill.

Which country experienced an increase in collection amounts? The country of Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would mean more money for government spending. On the other hand, Silvania, a southern country increased taxation hoping they would increase collection amounts. The problem was that Silvanian people increased taxation above the critical rate. Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.","completion":"The country which experienced an increase in collection amounts is Hinland. The paragraph explains that Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would lead to more money for government spending. By doing so, they likely brought their tax rate below the critical rate described by the Laffer curve. On the contrary, Silvania increased taxation above the critical rate, which would result in decreasing government revenue due to a decline in labor supply caused by high tax rates. The Laffer curve demonstrates that when the tax rate surpasses a certain critical point, the government's revenue will decrease as the tax rate increases. This is because, at higher tax rates, individuals are less inclined to work, reducing the overall labor supply and thereby lowering the government's tax revenue. By decreasing the tax rate, Hinland was able to stimulate an increase in labor supply, which in turn led to higher government revenue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This legendary English rock band is known for its transformative influence on the music industry and pop culture during their active years between 1960 and 1970. \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" is one of their iconic songs and a crucial milestone in their career. \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" was written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and originally released in the UK on 29 November 1963 by Parlophone as the group's sixth UK single. Then, after introducing it to the American music scene, it was released in the US on 26 December 1963 by Capitol Records and it marked the Beatles' breakthrough there. The song has a significant history behind it. Marsha Albert, a 15-year-old resident of Silver Spring, Maryland, was instrumental in coaxing a reluctant American music industry to introduce the Beatles to the U.S. airwaves. After seeing a segment about the Beatles on CBS Evening News, she wrote to Washington D.C. radio station WWDC requesting Beatles music, saying, \\"Why can't we have music like that here in America?\\" The station's disc jockey, Carroll James, arranged to have a copy of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" flown in from England. On December 17, 1963, James played it on the radio for the first time in America, recalling how he had requested Albert to introduce it. That moment proved pivotal for the Beatles' success in the United States. \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" became their first number one hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, holding that position for seven weeks, and was the beginning of the British Invasion of the American music scene.

Definition: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1. Input: find the average price_in_euros and the minimum price_in_pounds in Catalog_Contents table Output:","completion":"In this task, you are asked to provide an SQL statement based on the given English description. The description wants you to find the average price_in_euros and the minimum price_in_pounds from the Catalog_Contents table. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to construct this SQL statement: 1. Since we are required to find the average and minimum price, we will use the aggregate functions AVG() and MIN(). 2. We will use SELECT to choose the columns needed (average price_in_euros and minimum price_in_pounds). 3. We will use FROM to specify the table Catalog_Contents. The SQL statement to achieve the above task is: \`\`\`sql SELECT AVG(price_in_euros) AS avg_price_in_euros, MIN(price_in_pounds) AS min_price_in_pounds FROM Catalog_Contents; \`\`\` This statement finds the average of the price_in_euros and the minimum of the price_in_pounds from the Catalog_Contents table and returns the result. The column names are then renamed as avg_price_in_euros and min_price_in_pounds using the AS statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Now it's called what? Choices: - bedroom - istanbul - body - human being - treasure The rationale to choose \\"istanbul\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"The answer 'Istanbul' is the most logical choice, given the context of the question and the available options. This rationale is based on several factors, such as historical evidence, geographical changes, cultural implications, and the inapplicability of the other options to the situation. We can break down the reasons for choosing \\"Istanbul\\" as follows: 1. Historical evidence: Istanbul, formerly known as Constantinople and Byzantium, is a city with a rich history that has undergone several transformations due to political shifts and cultural changes. In 1453, when the Ottoman Empire conquered the city, it was renamed Istanbul. Mary's grandfather might have been originally from Constantinople, and thus, it is no longer called by the same name as when he left. Considering the timeline of events and the history of the city, Istanbul is the most likely correct option. 2. Geographical changes: Changing the name of a place is not unusual throughout history. For example, many cities have been renamed due to political reasons, either by the ruling government, after gaining independence, or following an invasion. If Mary's grandfather was from such a place, then it is reasonable to assume that the city she could no longer return to is now called Istanbul. 3. Cultural implications: The name Istanbul is deeply rooted in Turkish culture, dating back to the ancient period of the Byzantine Empire. The influence of the Ottoman Empire on the city made it an important center for the Islamic world and Europe. Choosing \\"Istanbul\\" as the answer is also a subtle acknowledgment of the cultural significance of the city and its historic connection with various civilizations. 4. Inapplicability of other options: The other options presented as potential answers - bedroom, body, human being, and treasure - do not align with the context of the question. Each of these options refers to something entirely different from a place or geographical location. For instance, \\"bedroom\\" is a room, \\"body\\" and \\"human being\\" are biological terms, and \\"treasure\\" signifies something valuable. None of these options accurately represents a place that Mary's grandfather might have come from or where she could no longer return to. In conclusion, using historical references, geographical changes, the cultural significance of Istanbul, and the inapplicability of other options, we can confidently choose \\"Istanbul\\" as the correct answer to the question. Mary's grandfather's birthplace is no longer called by the same name due to a shift in political landscape, and the place's name has changed to Istanbul, making it the most relevant selection among the choices provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Hill members grill CDC on Ebola at hearing Washington (CNN) -- A House panel sharply questioned health officials Thursday over the U.S. response to the Ebola virus, as well as steps to prevent an outbreak of the disease in the United States. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Thomas Frieden and other government officials faced tough questions from members of both parties after a second Texas nurse was diagnosed with Ebola, but the line of questioning from Republicans and Democrats on the investigative committee pushed two contrasting paths to keep the disease from spreading in the U.S. Republicans again called for travel restrictions to prevent new Ebola cases from coming to U.S. shores while Democrats provided backup for the Obama administration and gave health officials, including Frieden, a chance to explain why a ban would not be effective and could, in fact, make the situation worse. Rep. Tim Murphy, the Republican who chaired the hearing, asked the CDC director how the Texas nurse who treated the only patient to have died in the U.S. of Ebola was able to board a plane after checking in with the Center. He also raised questions about policies to keep Ebola off of U.S. soil. \\"The trust and credibility of the administration and government are waning,\\" Murphy said, adding that the U.S. should \\"do everything in our power to keep the American people safe from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\\" How did nurse who treated Ebola patient fly on commercial jet? Murphy said a ban on travelers from West Africa could keep the disease from spreading further in the U.S and said that screening patients for fever is not enough to present a disease, citing a study that about 13% of patients infected with Ebola in West Africa had no fever. Frieden insisted that current screenings at U.S and West African airports were sufficient to protect Americans, but said he would \\"consider any options to better protect Americans. The ranking Democrat Rep. Diana DeGette agreed with Friden that a travel ban would be effective and said that while another person with Ebola symptoms will likely land at a U.S. hospital, the American health system can prevent the disease from spreading. \\"We should not panic. We know how to stop Ebola outbreaks,\\" she said. \\"The best way to stop Ebola is to fight it in Africa.\\" How the Ebola virus spreads Murphy suggested the administration would not establish a ban to avoid hurting \\"fledgling democracies\\" in West Africa, but said that shouldn't be a concern for American officials as they look to protect Americans. Rep. Fred Upton, the full committee's chairman, suggested banning people who have been in the most affected West African nations from entering the U.S. to keep those who may have been infected with Ebola but haven't yet showed symptoms of the disease at bay. \\"I just don't understand [how] we can't look at one's travel history and say, 'no, you're not coming here, not until this situation' -- you're right it needs to be solved in Africa, but until it is we should not be allowing these folks in. Period,\\" Upton said. But Frieden said a ban could encourage people in West Africa to take advantage of porous borders in the region and get to the United States another way, which would undermine U.S. efforts to screen patients at airports and be able to track and monitor potentially infected people. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman used some of their time during the hearing to blame spending cuts for undercutting the Centers for Disease Control and National Institute of Health's ability to fight the disease. Waxman noted that the CDC budget has dropped by 12% since 2006 and that the public health emergency preparedness fund has been cut to 612 million from 1 billion in 2002. Waxman also used his time during the hearing to feed questions to Frieden and infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Health to push their explanation of the unintended consequences of imposing a travel ban. \\"It's certainly understandable how someone might come to a conclusion that the best approach would be to just seal off the border from those countries,\\" Fauci said. \\"[A travel ban would lead to] a big web of things we don't know what we're dealing with.\\" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee, picked up on Frieden's \\"porous borders\\" comment thinking the CDC director was referring to the U.S.'s borders and asked if the U.S. should \\"worry about having an unsecured southern and northern border.\\" \\"Oh you're referring to that border and not our porous border,\\" Blackburn said after Frieden corrected her. In his opening remarks, Frieden also said the U.S. has helped implement effective airport screenings at airports in affected countries and noted that those screenings identified 74 people with fever in September. He also noted his agency's heightened efforts to increase awareness among physicians about how to identify Ebola. 5 things nurses say the Texas hospital got wrong A second health care worker was diagnosed with Ebola on Wednesday. Amber Vinson, 29, works as a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was treated. Duncan died last week. But many are questioning how Vinson was able to board a commercial flight and travel back and forth to Ohio after she was being monitored as part of the team that cared for Duncan. Vinson was moved from Dallas to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta on Wednesday, where two others who contracted Ebola were treated. But Frieden said that Vinson should never have traveled on a commercial plane. Nina Pham, a nurse who also treated Duncan, was the first at the Dallas Hospital to be diagnosed with Ebola, but her condition has improved, and she is being transfered to NIH in Maryland. House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement late Wednesday, \\"A temporary ban on travel to the United States from countries afflicted with the virus is something that the president should absolutely consider along with any other appropriate actions as doubts about the security of our air travel systems grow.\\" So far Administration officials have cautioned that putting a ban in place could complicate the ability to get supplies and personnel to the affected region, and make it harder to stop the spread of the disease. The Texas hospital where Duncan was treated has been criticized for how it responded to Duncan's symptoms, and for failing to put protocols in place to protect those health care workers who came in contact with him. In prepared testimony, Daniel Varga, the Chief Clinical Officer for the Texas company that includes Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, apologized to the House committee. \\"Unfortunately, in our initial treatment of Mr. Duncan, despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team, we made mistakes. We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola. We are deeply sorry,\\" Varga said.","completion":"A group of important people in the US government talked to health officials about how the US is dealing with the Ebola virus. They want to make sure everyone in the US is safe from the disease. Some people think that the US should not let people from countries where Ebola is a problem come to the US. Others think that stopping people from coming won't help and may make it harder to help those countries that are affected by Ebola. The health officials said that they are doing their best to keep Americans safe, and they are working to stop the disease from spreading in Africa."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house during a weekend jaunt, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With the help of her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is a success.

In the latest study on what may well be a superfood, scientists at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, report in the journal Food Research International that red onions in particular boast an ability to disrupt cancer cell communication and promote a generally poor environment for cancer cells, \\"which inhibits growth.\\" The team was looking specifically at colon cancer, but they found that the onion cells are just as good at killing breast cancer cells. The trick, reports Huffpost, will be to extract the key ingredient, dose it just right, and use it medicinally. That key ingredient is quercetin, a flavonoid already known for its cancer-fighting properties. This study finds that onions in general have unusually high levels of quercetin compared to other foods, and that Ontario onions in particular have high levels of the compound compared to onions grown elsewhere. But red onions also boast high levels of anthocyanin, a plant pigment that help make quercetin molecules better scavengers. (Because anthocyanin helps make foods colorful, it makes sense to the researchers that red onions, which are so dark, have the greatest cancer-fighting potential.) It's unclear whether red onions from outside of Ontario will be as effective, but Time reports the researchers think it's likely, and plan to start clinical trials. (Onions also help reduce the risk of heart disease.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Onions, specifically red onions, have long been considered a healthy addition to a balanced diet due to their numerous health benefits. Recently, scientists at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, conducted a study published in the journal Food Research International, which revealed that red onions could potentially be labeled as a superfood thanks to their remarkable cancer-fighting properties. The study focused mainly on colon cancer but also found that onion cells had similar effects on breast cancer cells. Red onions displayed a unique ability to disrupt cancer cell communication and create an unfavorable environment for cancer cells to grow in. This new information opens up further possibilities for cancer treatment through extracting the specific compound responsible for these effects and using it as a therapeutic agent with appropriate dosage. The key cancer-fighting ingredient found in onions is a flavonoid called quercetin. It is already well-known for its anticancer properties among researchers. The study discovered that onions in general, compared to other foods, had significantly higher levels of quercetin. Furthermore, onions cultivated in Ontario were found to contain even higher concentrations of this particular compound. However, what sets red onions apart from others is their elevated levels of another compound called anthocyanin. Anthocyanin is a plant pigment responsible for the vibrant colors in various fruits, vegetables, and flowers. In red onions, anthocyanin is thought to enhance the effectiveness of quercetin molecules, making them stronger scavengers. The presence of anthocyanin in red onions lends credence to the researchers' hypothesis regarding their superior cancer-fighting potential compared to other onions. As of now, it remains uncertain whether red onions grown outside of Ontario will exhibit similar cancer-fighting properties. However, the research team believes that this is probably the case and intends to proceed with clinical trials to evaluate the effects of red onions on cancer patients. In addition to their cancer-fighting potential, onions have been known to offer numerous other health benefits. They are an excellent source of vitamins (A, B6, C, and E), minerals (potassium, calcium, sodium, and iron), and dietary fiber. Furthermore, red onions have been linked to reduced risk of heart disease, improved digestive function, and enhanced immune function. In conclusion, incorporating red onions into a balanced diet may provide a wealth of health advantages, including their newly discovered cancer-fighting properties. As research continues to unravel the full potential of this flavorful vegetable, it becomes increasingly evident that red onions may indeed be a superfood worth adding to our plates."},{"prompt":"Title: Bed Frame Product review: I received the bed frame quickly and the price appeared to be a good price.

Lindsey rigged the system in their favor to beat Victoria, because Choose from: -Lindsey was never going to win otherwise. -Victoria was never going to win otherwise.","completion":"Lindsey rigged the system in their favor to beat Victoria, because Lindsey was never going to win otherwise. Ever since they were kids, Lindsey and Victoria were pitted against each other, whether it was in academics, sports, or extracurricular activities. While it wasn't always a contentious rivalry, it was clear that both of them felt the pressure to succeed and outdo the other. Growing up, Victoria had always been the one who received accolades, awards, and admiration from their peers and teachers. She was naturally talented and had a charismatic personality that drew people to her. Lindsey, on the other hand, had always been more of a 'middle of the pack' type. They had to work harder just to match Victoria's level, and this intense competition put a strain on their friendship. As they grew older, the disparity in their abilities, success, and popularity widened. Victoria seemed to excel at everything she tried, whereas Lindsey often fell short. This imbalance led Lindsey to develop feelings of inadequacy, frustration, and jealousy towards Victoria. When the opportunity presented itself for a devious plan, Lindsey saw this as a chance to finally steal the spotlight. They knew they couldn't hope to compete with Victoria on a level playing field, so they began scheming to tip the scales in their favor. In the weeks leading up to the big competition, Lindsey spent countless hours researching tactics, loopholes, and tricks that would enable them to achieve victory at any cost. As the competition day neared, Lindsey put their plan into action. They used every resource at their disposal to manipulate the odds in their favor. They hacked the competition's computer system to alter the scores and tampered with the judging criteria, ensuring that they would be given a significant advantage over Victoria. When the competition finally arrived, all of Lindsey's manipulations and months of planning paid off. They successfully rigged the system, and Victoria was defeated - a first in all their years as rivals. But even as they stood on the winner's podium, basking in the glory of their hard-won triumph, Lindsey couldn't shake off the nagging feeling that their victory was tainted. The recognition, the attention, and the satisfaction that they'd always craved felt hollow. They realized that in their desperate bid to prove themselves, they had sacrificed the genuine friendship they once shared with Victoria. This victory had come at a high price, one that Lindsey wasn't sure they were willing to pay. As their peers showered them with praise and congratulations, they couldn't help but wonder if it was all worth it. In the end, the true cost of Lindsey's deceit was much higher than they had anticipated. Sure, they had finally managed to outdo Victoria in this one instance, but the damage done to their own self-esteem and to the relationships that mattered most to them was irreversible. It was a harsh lesson, as they learned that sometimes the pursuit of victory can lead to the ultimate defeat in the game of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The plot was weak and predictable (WOW, He is actually supermans son, who would have ever thought....) and the acting was horrible. This movie has one good thing going for it, and it's name is Kevin Spacey. His portrayal of Lex Luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie.

Comments on Superman as a character: The reviewer mentions that Superman deserves respect but criticizes the portrayal of the character in the movie (\\"Brandon Routh was the worst superman I've ever seen\\"). 3. Negative comments on the actor (Brandon Routh): The reviewer asserts a strong dislike for the actor, wanting to \\"shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat\\" and stating that he looks \\"silly\\" in the costume. 4. Negative comments on the actress (Kate Bosworth): The reviewer states that Kate Bosworth was a \\"bad choice\\" for Lois Lane, and her portrayal of the character didn't fit the expectations of a \\"hard-ass reporter.\\" 5. Comments on the plot: The plot is described as \\"weak and predictable,\\" indicating dissatisfaction. 6. Comments on acting: The reviewer claims the acting is \\"horrible,\\" which is another negative point about the movie. 7. Positive comments on Kevin Spacey: The reviewer praised Kevin Spacey's portrayal of Lex Luthor as \\"brilliant,\\" which is a positive aspect of the movie. 8. Suggestions for improvement: The reviewer believes the movie could have been improved with a different cast and story. 9. Comparison with another movie: The reviewer expresses their shock that the movie was worse than \\"the hills have eyes,\\" which implies a strong negative sentiment.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? A professional mental health therapist can help you identify the source of your negative emotions and develop healthy skills to lead a more satisfying life. Your self-worth may have been jeopardized by unhealthy relationships or abuse from your past. Talking about these experiences in a unbiased and supportive context can lead to healing. One recognized form of therapy for those who self-sabotage is dialectical behavior therapy. This treatment approach is directed at gaining a better understanding of your feelings in order to build skills that help you stop problematic behaviors. You may work with your therapist to prevent overeating, stop risky sexual activities, and establish healthy relational patterns. Another is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT will help you identify beliefs that fuel your self-worth. Once you identify those beliefs, you can explore their origins and validity and eventually replace them with thoughts and beliefs that are true. Self-sabotage is prominent in people who feel depressed but do not know how to express or improve their emotions. If feeling unloved has led to depressive symptoms, you need to see a doctor. Depression may manifest as a loss of interest in once pleasurable activities, withdrawing from loved ones, having trouble eating or sleeping, and feeling hopeless. A certain class of prescribed medications known as antidepressants are effective at improve depressive symptoms. This may be advisable if therapy alone does not improve your symptoms. Support is imperative for anyone struggling with mental illness. It's vital to build a network of health care providers and loved one who are there for you as you heal. However, meeting with other people who have gone through what you are going through can also be comforting. Ask your mental health provider about support groups for people who are struggling with the same issues as you. Attending these groups can help you learn how others cope with feeling unloved and help you gain a sense of belonging in a supportive group.

Plot: Meet Keith DeVries - a talented software engineer living in Los Angeles, trying to lead a normal life with his wife, Carla, and their 12-year-old daughter, Lilly. But DeVries has a dark secret: he was once part of a notorious cybercriminal group responsible for hacking into and stealing money from various financial institutions. Seven years have passed since he left the group. On the night of Carla's birthday, DeVries receives a mysterious phone call from a man named Carter, who claims to be part of his past. Carter threatens to reveal DeVries' former criminal activities if he doesn't help him with a new mysterious heist. DeVries, feeling the weight of his past actions, gets involved despite his fears. However, the heist is more complicated than it seems; it's a setup designed to frame DeVries, leading him to be hunted down by the LAPD and the FBI. As the hunt for DeVries intensifies, he works to prove his innocence and expose Carter's true intentions. His only ally is a rookie detective named Lisa Jenkins, who believes in his innocence.

A:","completion":"Tree city experienced the release of energy that was stored in the rocks less often. This is because Tree city had fewer and less frequent earthquakes compared to Red city. The distance to a volcano and plate boundaries could be a contributing factor for this difference, as Tree city is further away from the volcano (60 miles) compared to Red city (10 miles).

Answer:","completion":"The text refers to the category of \\"building\\". This is because Port Lincoln Prison is a physical structure where prisoners are housed. It fulfills the characteristics of the \\"building\\" category because it is a constructed entity with specific functions - in this case, serving as a place of detention and also a place where farming activities take place. This facility holds prisoners and provides them with opportunities to work while serving their time. Not only does it function as a traditional prison ensuring the confinement of prisoners, but it also operates an agricultural business where sheep and cattle are raised.

For instance, in SI units, energy is measured in joules, and one joule is defined \\"mechanically\\", being the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.[note 1] However, there are many other definitions of energy, depending on the context, such as thermal energy, radiant energy, electromagnetic, nuclear, etc., where definitions are derived that are the most convenient.

This low-budget crap-fest didn't have a shred of humor, and it didn't make much sense, either.

The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess that's good enough. The military tries feebly to kill the monster, which isn't much larger than a man. They have very bad aim. Then the military FLEES! Wow, did this movie make the U.S. military look pathetic or what? The monster, while hard to kill, doesn't do much besides shuffle around and roar.

Information: - Polar Trappers is a 1938 Donald Duck and Goofy cartoon set in the South Pole , where the duo are trapping polar animals . This is the first cartoon that Donald Duck and Goofy appear without Mickey Mouse . - Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre. - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer. A pioneer of the American animation industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons. As a film producer, Disney holds the record for most Academy Awards earned by an individual, having won 22 Oscars from 59 nominations. He was presented with two Golden Globe Special Achievement Awards and an Emmy Award, among other honors. Several of his films are included in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress. - Goofy is a funny-animal cartoon character created in 1932 at Walt Disney Productions. Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic dog with a Southern drawl, and typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and is one of Disney's most recognizable characters. He is normally characterized as extremely clumsy and dimwitted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive, and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way. - Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928.

Herbert Sausgruber was born close to which Central European freshwater lake? Answer:","completion":"Herbert Sausgruber was born in Hohenems, Austria. Hohenems is a town situated in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, which is in the westernmost part of Austria, sharing borders with Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. Having this information, we can now determine the prominent Central European freshwater lake near his birthplace. In this region, there are several lakes, but the most significant one is Lake Constance (known as Bodensee in German). Lake Constance borders Germany, Austria, and Switzerland and is the largest lake in Western Europe's Alpine region. With an area of approximately 536 square kilometers, the lake spans over 63 km in length and 14 km in width. It was formed by the Rhine Glacier during the last ice age and is now a crucial water source for the region. Hohenems, the birthplace of Herbert Sausgruber, is approximately 40 kilometers east of Lake Constance as the crow flies, making it the most relevant lake in the context. While there might be smaller freshwater bodies closer to Hohenems, Lake Constance holds significant importance as a Central European freshwater lake due to its size, historical relevance, and impact on the region's ecology and economy.

Answer the following question: Americans may become accustomed to the political turmoil swirling around President Donald Trump, but it remains an open question whether that turmoil will ultimately help or hurt Trump and his Republican allies, especially in an election year. Last week, it was Trump's firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and an apparent Democratic victory in a special congressional election in Pennsylvania — a sign of a possible wave in the November midterm elections. This week, it was a series of presidential tweets criticizing the Russia probe, followed by a controversial Trump statement of congratulations for newly re-elected Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also added former U.S. attorney Joseph diGenova to his legal team. DiGenova has alleged that elements of the FBI and the Department of Justice have been out to frame Trump in connection with the Russia probe. Trump ignored shouted questions Tuesday from reporters at the White House who asked whether he wanted to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia probe. Earlier, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters at the Capitol that he had received \\"assurances\\" that firing Mueller was \\"not even under consideration.\\" The latest back and forth over the Mueller investigation came after several days of presidential tweets complaining about the probe, including one blasting it as a \\"total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest.\\" The tweets sparked new fears that Trump might try to have Mueller fired. Some Republicans warned that an attempt to fire Mueller could put Trump's presidency in jeopardy. \\"I think anything directed at firing Mr. Mueller blows up the whole town, and that becomes the end of governing and the presidency as we know it,\\" cautioned Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. The renewed focus on the Russia probe came in the wake of last week's firing of Tillerson. That, in turn, raised the prospect of more administration changes. What can put the presidency at risk?

Then I got it.\\"In May 1982, Simon & Garfunkel went on a world tour with stops in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Ireland, France, Great Britain, New Zealand, the US and Canada. The European leg of their tour began on May 28, 1982, at the Stadion am Bieberer Berg in Offenbach am Main. This was their first performance in Germany, and had an attendance of around 40,000 spectators.When they were not on the road, the duo went into the studio to work on what was to be a reunion Simon & Garfunkel album, tentatively entitled Think Too Much, with Garfunkel adding harmony vocals to a bunch of new songs for which Simon had already laid down some backing tracks. They set a release date of spring 1983 to coincide with their planned North American tour, but after increasingly acrimonious delays and disagreements, Simon told Warner Brothers he could no longer work with Garfunkel and that the project as an S&G album was cancelled. Thus Garfunkel dropped out of the project, which then became Simon's November 1983 solo album Hearts and Bones.Several years would pass before Simon & Garfunkel worked together again.

Text: While it takes light approximately 2.54 million years to traverse the gulf of space between Earth and, for instance, the Andromeda Galaxy, it would take a much shorter amount of time from the point of view of a traveler at close to the speed of light due to the effects of time dilation; the time experienced by the traveler depending both on velocity (anything less than the speed of light) and distance traveled (length contraction). Intergalactic travel for humans is therefore possible, in theory, from the point of view of the traveller. Question: if travelling at the speed of light would it take 1 million years to reach the andromeda galaxy?","completion":"To answer the question, let's first understand the important concepts involved in this scenario, and then calculate how long it would take to reach the Andromeda Galaxy if traveling at the speed of light. Step 1: Know the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy The distance between Earth and the Andromeda Galaxy is approximately 2.54 million light-years. Step 2: Understand the concept of time dilation Time dilation occurs when an object is moving close to the speed of light. The faster the object travels, the slower the time passes for that object relative to an observer at rest. Step 3: Calculate the time experienced by the traveler if traveling at the speed of light If the traveler was hypothetically traveling at the speed of light (which is physically impossible for any object with mass), time dilation would be at its maximum. The time experienced by the traveler moving at the speed of light would theoretically be infinitely less than the time experienced by an observer at rest. As a result, if a traveler could somehow achieve the speed of light, from their perspective, it would take less than 1 million years to reach the Andromeda Galaxy. However, this is only a theoretical concept, as no object with mass can reach the speed of light. If and when humans develop intergalactic travel technologies, they would need to rely on speeds closer to but less than the speed of light, and the travel time would be subject to time dilation effects accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In Guazacapán, now a municipality in Santa Rosa, Pedro de Alvardo described his encounter with people who were neither Maya nor Pipil, speaking a different language altogether; these people were probably Xinca. At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly Kaqchikel and Cholutec. Alvarado and his army defeated and occupied the most important Xinca city, named as Atiquipaque, usually considered to be in the Taxisco area. The defending warriors were described by Alvarado as engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat using spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. The battle took place on 26 May 1524 and resulted in a significant reduction of the Xinca population. Alvarado's army continued eastwards from Atiquipaque, seizing several more Xinca cities. Tacuilula feigned a peaceful reception only to unsuccessfully raise arms against the conquistadors within an hour of their arrival. Taxisco and Nancintla fell soon afterwards. Because Alvarado and his allies could not understand the Xinca language, Alvarado took extra precautions on the march eastward by strengthening his vanguard and rearguard with ten cavalry apiece. In spite of these precautions the baggage train was ambushed by a Xinca army soon after leaving Taxisco. Many indigenous allies were killed and most of the baggage was lost, including all the crossbows and ironwork for the horses. This was a serious setback and Alvarado camped his army in Nancintla for eight days, during which time he sent two expeditions against the attacking army. Jorge de Alvarado led the first attempt with thirty to forty cavalry and although they routed the enemy they were unable to retrieve any of the lost baggage, much of which had been destroyed by the Xinca for use as trophies.

You know waves, right? Like when you throw a stone into a puddle and you see circles moving away from the stone? Let me explain each one to you: 1. \\"Intensity and energy of a wave\\": This is a bit like the difference between how hard you shout and how long you shout. The energy of a wave is like how long you shout. It's the total amount of \\"wave\\" you have to use, which depends on both how loud (or \\"big\\") the wave is and how long it lasts.

The speed of a wave is like how fast you run—it's how fast the wave moves. If you imagine you and your friend are holding a long, stretched slinky and you move one end, the wave you create will move to the other end, right? That's wave speed. But then, frequency is like how often you jump while running—it's how many waves pass by a certain point in a certain time.

Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her.

Context: Yes, after my mother died I found out from my supposed half-sister that my dad was not my birth father. She was 19 yrs older than me and had been living in Colorado since I was young. I was born and raised in N.J. I did not see her she did not come to see us. I was grown, married, had children and was living in FL. when she showed up at my door with her husband. I was shocked since we never heard from her and I did not know she even knew where I lived. She stayed all of about 20 minutes, just long enough to very unpleasantly state that “my father is NOT your father and I am NOT your sister!” I always wondered why my mom hated me SO much, I found out that both my mom and “dad\\" were having affairs while married and both had children by someone else. I have never met my birth father (to my knowledge) only know his name, but understand that he was the father of my supposed half-brother (which would make him my only whole sibling out of seven siblings.) Obviously my oldest “half-brother\\", who is 20 yrs older than me, is not actually related to me either. I don't have for sure “proof\\" about my other siblings, but they all have strong resemblances to my “dad\\" and each other. Growing up people would comment about how much I looked like my mom but I also was told a lot that you would never know me and my other sisters were sisters, we used to laugh about it as kids because my sisters (all light haired/light skinned) and I (dark haired/deeper skin toned) were very different in appearance but we “knew\\" we were sisters. I also found out that my apparently ONLY whole brother, approximately 9 yrs older than me, did not even know his real fathers name even though he knew our “dad“ was not his birth father. Question: How long probably was it since the author had seen her supposed half-sister? Answer:","completion":"The text does not provide an exact duration of how long it was since the author had seen her supposed half-sister. However, it is mentioned that she did not see her half-sister while growing up in New Jersey, and only met her once she was grown, married, and had children in Florida.

Available choices: [A]. yes [B]. no","completion":"[B]. No, the answer is incorrect because it does not provide information about the length of the Plymouth Sound Breakwater in kilometers. The Plymouth Sound Breakwater is a man-made structure located in Plymouth Sound, a body of water situated off the coast of Plymouth in England. The breakwater was built to provide a safe anchorage for naval vessels and to protect the harbor from destructive waves caused by storms. The construction of the Plymouth Sound Breakwater started in 1812 and was completed in 1841. Throughout these years, about 4 million tons of limestone from nearby quarries on the shores of Plymouth Sound was used to form the breakwater. The Plymouth Sound Breakwater measures 1,560 meters long, or 1.56 kilometers. Its width at the base is approximately 65 meters, while its width at the top is about 10 meters. The breakwater stands around 4 meters above the high-water level. To further enhance its protective role, a lighthouse known as the Plymouth Sound Breakwater Fort was built on the breakwater. Its main goal was to protect the entrance to Plymouth Sound, recognizing the strategic importance of Plymouth Sound as a point of naval and merchant shipping. In conclusion, the Plymouth Sound Breakwater, a significant piece of engineering work that has been a crucial part of Plymouth's marine history, is 1.56 kilometers long."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Spiders are not insects as many people believe. They belong to a class of animals called arachnids . Spiders have eight eyes, four pairs of legs, and can grow a new leg if they lose one. A spider's body is divided into two sections: the abdomen and the thorax .The legs, eyes, and mouthparts are in the thorax section. Most spiders have poison glands and sharp teeth. They use their sharp teeth to force poison into the insects they catch for food. This poison can make an insect lose the ability to move, and the helpless insect is then _ by the spider. Spiders usually have silk glands under their abdomen. They produce a liquid that is thicker than water from their glands. When the liquid comes into the air, it dries into silk. Many spiders use this silk to form webs to catch insects and to make cocoons that protect their eggs. This amazing silk is also used to create lines that spiders hang onto as they travel to new areas. Spiders live in almost everywhere on earth. The only places where there are no spiders are the coldest places, the highest mountains and the seas. According to the passage, which of the following is WRONG? A) Spiders are not insects. B) All spiders have poison glands. C) Spiders make cocoons to keep their eggs safe. D) There are no spiders in the coldest places. Answer:","completion":"B) All spiders have poison glands. Although most spiders have poison glands, it is not accurate to say that all spiders have them. There are some spider species that do not possess venom glands, and they use other methods to catch and subdue their prey. For example, the Uloboridae family of spiders lack venom glands completely and use their specialized silk instead to immobilize their prey.

What same word can be a word for theatrical scenery, a list of songs performed at a concert or a sequence of legs in darts?","completion":"The word that can be used to describe theatrical scenery, a list of songs performed at a concert, or a sequence of legs in a darts game is 'set'. As a highly versatile word in English language, 'set' has several definitions depending on the context in which it's used. 1. 'Set' in Theatrical Scenery: In theatre, a 'set' refers to the environment in which the action of the play occurs. This might include physical structures on the stage, such as buildings or interiors, as well as more abstract or symbolic elements like lighting and sound. The set works to support the world of the play, helping to convey setting, mood, and character. The design, fabrication, and arrangement of set pieces is a key aspect of stagecraft and is often overseen by a dedicated set designer or team of designers. 2. 'Set' in Music: In the context of a concert or musical performance, a 'set' typically refers to a pre-determined list of songs to be played by the band or artist. This set list serves as a roadmap for the performance, allowing musicians to structure their show, control the pace and flow of the concert, and ensure that they cover all of the material they intend to perform. The ordering of songs within a set can have a significant impact on the audience's experience, potentially heightening emotional engagement or building anticipation for fan-favorite tracks. 3. 'Set' in Darts: In a darts game, a 'set' refers to a sequence of legs, which are individual games within a match. Essentially, each game is one leg and a set is a collection of these games. The numbers of legs in a set can vary, but commonly there are best of 5 or best of 7 legs in a set. The player or team that wins a predetermined number of these sets faster than their opponent wins the match. This system allows for clear, incremental progress within the larger structure of the darts match. The versatility of the word 'set' illustrates the richness of English vocabulary, where single words can carry multiple meanings across a variety of different contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. On Wednesday, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in my case challenging the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act, widely known as DOMA. I was honored and humbled by the opportunity to have my case considered by our nation's highest court. I have also been overwhelmed by the love and support I have received from people all across the country. To be honest, I never could have imagined that this day would come -- the day that I would be \\"out\\" as an 83-year-old lesbian suing the federal government. My late wife, Thea Spyer, was, and is, the love of my life. Although we couldn't live openly for much of our relationship, we became engaged in 1967 with a circular diamond brooch that symbolized the rings we weren't able to wear on our fingers. And we stayed engaged for the next 40 years, caring for each other, sharing all the joys and sorrows that came our way. Victory years after longtime partner's death. We lived through good times -- with jobs that we loved, great friends and a lot of dancing. But we also depended on each other for strength through the vicissitudes of aging and illness. In 1977, Thea was diagnosed with progressive multiple sclerosis, which became debilitating over time. First, she had to use one cane, then two crutches, then a wheelchair. In Thea's last years, she was quadriplegic. We were lucky that the MS never affected her brilliant mind or her cognition, and that she was able to continue seeing patients as a psychologist until the day that she died. In 2007, we learned from Thea's doctors that she had only one year to live. When we realized that we were running out of time, we decided to marry in Canada. That marriage was recognized in our home state of New York. We wanted to be married for the same reason most people want to marry: to publicly and legally express our love and commitment to one another. When our wedding announcement ran in The New York Times, we heard from hundreds of people from every stage of our lives -- playmates and schoolmates, colleagues, friends and relatives -- pouring out love and congratulations because we were married. That's why marriage is different -- it's a magic word recognized by everyone as a demonstration of commitment and love. When my beautiful Thea died two years later, I was overcome with grief. Over the next month, I was hospitalized with a heart attack, and, in the midst of my grief, I realized that the federal government would not recognize our marriage. DOMA restricts federal marriage benefits and state-to-state recognition of marriages only to unions between a man and a woman. Because of DOMA, I was required to pay 363,000 in federal estate taxes that I would not have had to pay had I been married to a man instead of Thea. This was not only painful, it was wrong. I knew that Thea would want me to stand up for our marriage -- and for so many other gay couples and their families who are harmed by this unjust law. I believe that all marriages should be treated equally by the federal government in accordance with the Constitution. We won our case in two lower courts, and have now made it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States -- which is a monumental feat in itself. I know that Thea's spirit was with us Wednesday at the oral argument. But our journey is not yet over. If, through my case, our story can help to ensure that the federal government treats all marriages equally, that will be the best possible final chapter in our love story.

UPDATED:. 08:40 EST, 1 October 2013. A respected cancer specialist killed a 21-year-old cyclist who was on a bike ride with her boyfriend while driving on the bend of a road, a jury heard today. Dr Helen Measures told the jury how she overtook two cyclists in her red Mini only to drive into the path of two more riders coming from the opposite direction. She collided with waitress Denisa Perinova, who was out on a bike ride with her new boyfriend. Cyclist Denisa Perinova (left) died after colliding with the car of Dr Helen Measures (right), a jury heard. Miss Perinova, originally from the Czech Republic, allegedly lost control of her £300 second-hand bike, which was bought for her by her boyfriend, Ben Pontin, just four days before. She was flung 15 yards from the seat of her new racing bike and, despite wearing a helmet, died in hospital from severe head injuries a week later, the Oxford Crown Court jury was told. Measures, who has a doctorate in oncology and has worked as a scientist for leading pharmaceutical companies for the past 30 years, has denied causing Miss Perinova’s death by careless driving. A keen cyclist herself, she told the court: 'I can’t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel.' The 51-year-old divorced mother-of-four said she was travelling back from a garden centre to her home in Pishill, near Henley-on-Thames, at 40-50mph on July 15 last year. She was with her four-year-old daughter and her long-term boyfriend. The former parish church bell ringer said she had not seen the cyclists coming from the other direction when she overtook, and thought there was 'sufficient room' to make the manoeuvre. Measures said she was 'surprised' to see Mr Pontin and his girlfriend coming towards her as she rounded the curve in the road - but felt they still had enough room to get past. 'I don’t know why I didn’t see them,' she said. 'I had to make a decision of what to do. I felt the safest decision was to continue straight ahead because they were in single file. 'If I had been concerned, I would have stopped suddenly.' Mr Pontin had earlier told the jury he saw Measures make a 'stupid manoeuvre' in front of them on a bend in the A415. Describing the moment the oncoming car overtook the cyclists on the opposite side of the road, he said: 'I just couldn’t believe the person driving had overtaken at that point.' Miss Perinova, shown here with her parents and younger brother, died after the collision in July 2012. Mr Pontin said he was forced to aim for a 'tiny' gap and then felt his girlfriend’s wheel touch the back of his bike before looking around and seeing she had been flung 15 yards away in the collision. Her body lay motionless at the entrance to a field. Her helmet was smashed, and Mr Pontin said it was unclear whether she had been struck by the defendant’s Mini. Miss Perinova was initially rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, in Reading, before being transferred to a specialist neurological unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where she later died. Taking to the stand, Measures, who has previously been on family cycling holidays, said she did not have a chance to break. She said the first cyclist, Mr Pontin, went past her. However, Miss Perinova came at her at 'right angles' after losing control of her bike. In a heated exchange at Oxford Crown Court, Measures was challenged by prosecutor Sandra Beck, who said: 'You are relying on other road users avoiding you when you are on their side of the road?' Measures replied: 'I can’t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel. 'I would expect cyclists to generally remain upright as the first cyclist did and went past. 'When I looked, it was sufficiently clear not to stop me doing that manoeuvre. 'You do not make a manoeuvre if you don’t think it is safe to do so. 'Had everyone stayed upright, there would not have been an issue. 'I had my daughter in the car. I do not drive without due care and attention.' The trial, before Judge Patrick Eccles, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

Study A explained how increased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. On the other hand, study B showed how decreased greenhouse gases would affect the climate. Rob found the studies very interesting. But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. What is an answer for this question: Would study B see less or more wildlife population than study A? A:","completion":"Based on the provided background and understanding of the situation, Study A focuses on the effects of increased greenhouse gases on the climate, which would likely lead to more severe global warming. This increase in global warming results in the destruction of natural habitats and a subsequent reduction in wildlife population. Study B, on the other hand, addresses the impact of decreased greenhouse gases on the climate. This would imply that the effects of global warming would be less severe, potentially slowing down the destruction of habitats and allowing for a more stable environment for wildlife populations. Therefore, it can be concluded that Study B would likely see a higher wildlife population compared to Study A, since it investigates the potential benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and alleviating some of the negative consequences of climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15.

As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment.

Given the below context: Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

Once a coach has identified potential recruits, they begin reviewing these athletes more closely. They will verify your highlight reel and your statistics with your club and high school coaches. They will also verify your high school transcript with your school. At this stage it is important to have all of your information organized. Coaches want to see that potential recruits are taking this process seriously and are able to follow up with them with the information that they request. This is the stage where coaches or the recruiters they work with will come to watch you play. They may invite you on official or unofficial visits of the university and contact your family members. Coaches want to see that you are an upstanding young person who is responsible, a team player, committed to soccer, and interested in their university. During this time, you will need to spend time visiting the schools and meeting other players on the team. Continue to build your relationship with the college coach and emphasize that you are very interested in playing for them. Coaches that are interested in offering you a scholarship at this stage will extend verbal or formal written commitments. Depending on the school, you may receive this offer through your high school or club coach. You may have room to negotiate the terms of the offer but you should review them carefully. Read over each offer very carefully with your parents and coaches. There may be terms for the offer, like maintaining a certain grade point average or participating in a training camp before school starts, that you have to understand and follow. Unless you are a top recruit at one of the best Division I schools, you will probably be unable to negotiate any offer you receive. If there are some specific terms that you can negotiate, proceed cautiously. Teams have been known to pull offers from athletes that they believe to be too pushy or disrespectful. If you receive multiple offers, you may be able to leverage one offer against another. Keep in mind that some schools will offer a scholarship for a specific amount, like 20,000 each year, or a percentage, like 50% of tuition. A coach that offers you the highest amount, even if it is not a full ride, is unlikely to up their offer when they hear that schools are offering you less money. Congratulations!

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the actual person who began composing songs in a distinctive, original style on his return to England in 1918? , can you please find it? Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

Process: - There is a rain cloud in the sky - Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other - The collisions create electrical charge - Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud - Heavier, negatively charges particles rise to the top - When the positive and negative charges grow large enough, a giant spark, called lightning occurs - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person has a compromised immune system happens, how will it affect MORE/MORE POWERFUL lightning. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented involves the person having a compromised immune system and its potential effect on the occurrence of more/more powerful lightning. However, there is no direct or indirect correlation between an individual's immune system and the natural atmospheric processes that result in lightning. To reiterate the process of lightning formation, it occurs due to the separation of electrical charges within a cloud. As small ice particles collide with each other, they cause a build-up of electrical energy. Positively charged particles accumulate at the bottom of the cloud, and negatively charged particles gather at the top. When the charge difference becomes significant enough, lightning ensues as a discharge of this accumulated electrical energy. In summary, a person's immune system has no bearing on the formation or intensity of lightning, as lightning is a natural atmospheric phenomenon caused by the separation of electrical charges within a cloud. The perturbation hypothesis, in this case, is not applicable, as there is no known connection between human health and atmospheric processes responsible for lightning events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"A week ago, we mentioned the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but today we also have to acknowledge that many states not only fail to comply with human rights, but blatantly violate them. In this statement, the author is reflecting on the significance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which is a historic document that sets out fundamental rights and freedoms for all individuals. The UDHR was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 10, 1948, and its 60th anniversary marks an important milestone in the global recognition and protection of human rights. However, the author acknowledges the unfortunate reality that many countries around the world continue to disregard and actively violate these basic rights. Despite the international community's ongoing efforts to hold accountable those who violate human rights, it remains a challenge to ensure the fair treatment and recognition of every individual's inherent rights. The UDHR itself consists of 30 articles, which enumerate various rights and protections afforded to all human beings, regardless of their nationality, race, religion, or other distinctions. These rights cover various aspects of life, from civil and political rights like freedom of speech and assembly to social and economic rights such as the entitlement to work and education. Nonetheless, human rights abuses persist in many countries, often taking the form of oppressive government action, discrimination, and violence against marginalized communities, denial of basic services and opportunities, and the undermining of democratic institutions. These violations are not only a grave injustice at the individual level but also impede the global progress towards a more equitable and inclusive society. In order to address this critical issue, multiple organizations and initiatives have been established, including the United Nations Human Rights Council, numerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs), national human rights institutions, and ratification of various treaties and conventions. These actors work together to monitor, report, and respond to human rights abuses, as well as to promote awareness, education, and advocacy to improve the overall human rights situation worldwide. While much progress has been made since the adoption of the UDHR, there is still a long way to go in terms of fully realizing the vision of a world where everyone's human rights are respected and protected. By acknowledging the ongoing challenges, as well as the achievements made so far, we can continue to work towards eradicating human rights abuses and building a better, more just future for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Snakes on a Plane Movie plot: After witnessing gangster Eddie Kim brutally beat U.S. Prosecutor Daniel Hayes to death in Hawaii, Sean Jones is escorted by FBI agents Neville Flynn and John Sanders on a Boeing 747-400 to testify in a trial in Los Angeles. Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes to be placed in the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without being provoked, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in the bathroom, and a man using the bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX. Some of the snakes attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally releases the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to drop into the cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have made their way to the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts to dip downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system.

Let's solve this math problem step by step. We have the equation: 68949*o + 1303 = 68692*o - 496 Step 1: Let's find out the difference in the number of o's on both sides. So, subtract 68692*o from both sides: (68949*o - 68692*o) + 1303 = -496 Step 2: Now, let's do the subtraction of the o's. We get: (68949 - 68692)*o + 1303 = -496 That leaves us with: 257*o + 1303 = -496 Step 3: We need to isolate o, so we'll move everything not attached to o to the other side. Let's subtract 1303 from both sides: 257*o = -496 - 1303 Step 4: Now, let's do that subtraction. We get: 257*o = -1799 Step 5: Finally, we need to find out the value of o. To do that, we'll divide both sides by 257: o = -1799 ÷ 257 When we do that division, we find that: o = -7 So, the value of o is -7!

They were closely followed by Germans (15.2%), immigrants from Portugal (12.7%), France (5.6%), Serbia (5.3%), Turkey (3.8%), Spain (3.7%), and Austria (2%). Immigrants from Sri Lanka, most of them former Tamil refugees, were the largest group among people of Asian origin (6.3%).

Edmund Burke (1729-1797), an Irish political philosopher, was a strong advocate of parliamentary democracy and a keen observer of the very significant political and social changes happening during his time. Richard Price's sermon, a well-known Unitarian minister, and philosopher, had a profound effect on Burke. Price praised the French Revolution and ardently advocated for the cause of liberty and human rights. He delivered a sermon that became well-known, titled \\"A Discourse on the Love of Our Country.\\" This particular sermon acted as a catalytic moment for Burke, instigating him to pen down his thoughts and reactions on the French Revolution. Simultaneously, it triggered a debate between those who supported the revolution and those who saw it as something profoundly threatening. As mentioned in the statement, Burke wrote a draft in response to Price's sermon, which finally culminated in his masterpiece, \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France.\\" Published in 1790, this work was a direct response to Price's sermon and the events that were unfolding in France at the time. \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France\\" is a thorough and comprehensive critique of the French Revolution, which Edmund Burke views as being fueled by abstract, metaphysical ideas while lacking a proper understanding of the historical and social realities. In conclusion, the statement provided accurately answers the question, and the appropriate response from the options given would be option 1: Yes. Price's sermon was the catalyst for Burke's writing of \\"Reflections on the Revolution in France,\\" a pivotal work that sparked considerable debate on the revolution and its consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, I will highlight the pros and cons of the app to provide a balanced and fair review. Review: Title: \\"Decent tool for sheet music enthusiasts, but could use some improvements\\" Rating: 3 out of 5 stars As a musician who frequently works with sheet music, I was excited to try out the app com.midisheetmusic. Though the app does have a few redeeming qualities, it also has some drawbacks that left me wanting more. On the positive side, the app has a simple and clean user interface, and it is quite easy to navigate. The in-app library of MIDI files is a great feature, allowing users to access and play various pieces on the go. Additionally, the zooming and scrolling controls make it convenient to move through the sheet music. However, on the downside, the app's performance could use some improvements. At times, the sheet music rendering was slow and sluggish, which affected my overall experience. Moreover, the app was missing some important features, such as the ability to edit and annotate the sheet music, as well as the option to synchronize it with an external audio source. This limits the functionality of the app and could be a dealbreaker for some users. In conclusion, the com.midisheetmusic app serves as a decent tool for sheet music enthusiasts but falls short of providing the complete package. Although it is beneficial for accessing and playing sheet music on the go, the app's current limitations make it challenging to utilize as a professional tool. With some enhancements in performance and additional features, this app could potentially be a must-have for musicians."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"what is the final location mentioned?\\" Context: \\"During the Middle Ages, Paris was a center of Jewish learning with famous Talmudic scholars, such as Yechiel of Paris who took part in the Disputation of Paris between Christian and Jewish intellectuals.

Can we call them Fake Memos? ||||| FILE - In this June 21, 2017, file photo, special counsel Robert Mueller departs after a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) (Associated Press) FILE - In this June 21, 2017, file photo, special counsel Robert Mueller departs after a meeting on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the dismissal of Andrew McCabe, a former FBI deputy director, and the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election (all times local): 9:30 a.m. President Donald Trump is reviving concerns that the special counsel team investigating Russian election interference may be biased against him. Trump tweeted Sunday: \\"Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!\\" The tweet marks one of the first times that Trump has mentioned special counsel Robert Mueller by name. Trump allies previously have questioned whether Mueller can lead an unbiased probe because some of his investigators have made campaign contributions to Democratic candidates, including Hillary Clinton. Mueller is a former FBI director appointed by Republican President George W. Bush. Other Trump backers have noted that Mueller interviewed with Trump to serve another term as FBI director. Trump instead nominated Christopher Wray to lead the bureau. ___ 8:35 a.m. President Donald Trump is raising doubts about whether former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe kept personal memos outlining McCabe's interactions with the president. McCabe was fired Friday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Associated Press is reporting that McCabe's memos have been provided to special counsel Robert Mueller, who's investigating possible collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia.

And The Associated Press has learned that Andrew McCabe kept personal memos detailing interactions with President Donald Trump, and that those memos have been provided to special counsel Robert Mueller's office. The AP reports that the memos are similar to the notes compiled by Comey, who was fired last year as FBI director. McCabe's memos could factor into Mueller's investigation as his team examines Trump campaign ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice. McCabe's memos include details of his own interactions with the president. They also recount different conversations he had with Comey, who kept notes on meetings with Trump. That's according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation who wasn't authorized to discuss the memos publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. |||||Summary:","completion":"A man named Andrew McCabe, who used to work for the FBI, was fired by another important person called Jeff Sessions.

[b]. a dog in the house. [c]. a stray local chipmunk. [d]. a tiger in the zoo.","completion":"Based on the fact that \\"a chipmunk eats acorns,\\" the most likely scenario among the given options is: [c]. a stray local chipmunk. Here's a detailed explanation for each choice: [a]. A fish in the pond would not be interested in acorns, as they generally consume food that is found in their aquatic environment. Common food sources for fish include insects, plankton, algae, and other aquatic organisms. Acorns would not be a part of their natural diet, and they would not be physically able to leave the pond to retrieve the bag of acorns. [b]. A dog in the house could potentially be curious about the bag of acorns on the playground, but it would not be the most likely creature to take it. While dogs sometimes eat plant-based foods, most dogs primarily consume meat or other protein sources. Also, considering the dog is in the house, it would have less opportunity to access the bag of acorns compared to an animal that is already outdoors. [c]. A stray local chipmunk would be the most probable candidate to take the bag of acorns. Chipmunks are known to eat acorns, and this food source forms a significant part of their diet. Chipmunks also have a strong instinct to gather and store food, particularly nuts and seeds, to prepare for winter. Additionally, assuming the playground is located within the chipmunk's habitat or near wooded areas, the chipmunk would have easy access to the acorns. [d]. A tiger in the zoo would have no interest in the bag of acorns, as they are carnivorous animals with a diet primarily consisting of meats. Furthermore, if a tiger were in a zoo, it would not have direct access to the playground to take the bag of acorns. The zoo enclosure and caretakers would prevent the tiger from leaving its designated area, making it impossible for the tiger to retrieve the bag of acorns on the playground. In conclusion, considering the fact that chipmunks eat acorns, the most likely scenario is that a stray local chipmunk would take the bag of acorns left on the playground. The other options listed either have no interest in acorns, live in an environment where they could not access the bag, or are under restrictions that prevent them from retrieving it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With infinite possibilities and countless platforms to explore, it might seem overwhelming to discern what to prioritize when starting this quest. The following guide aims to simplify this process by providing step-by-step instructions and valuable suggestions. So, let's delve into the details and bring you closer to finding that special someone. Step 1: Identify Your Needs and Desires The first step to discovering your ideal match is determining what you want in a relationship. Reflect on your long-term goals, values, and preferences. Do you envision a committed partnership or something more casual? Are shared interests essential, or do you appreciate unique perspectives? Determining what you genuinely desire in a boyfriend will serve as your compass, guiding you in your journey. Step 2: Acknowledge Your Genuine Intentions Before diving into the dating world, honestly assess whether you are genuinely seeking a boyfriend or just filling a void in your life. Pursuing a relationship for the sake of companionship can lead to dissatisfaction and eventually emotional turmoil. Ensure that your motivations are rooted in a genuine desire to connect and share your life with someone special. Step 3: Look for Open-Minded Men An essential criterion during your search is finding a man who is receptive to a same-sex relationship. Mutual understanding and acceptance will foster a healthy, supportive partnership. Focus on people who are open-minded and embrace diversity so that you can be your authentic self in the relationship. Step 4: Tap into Your Social Circle You never know who might know someone perfect for you. Talk to friends, family members, and colleagues, asking if they can introduce you to someone who might be a good match. This connection may already be within your social circle, and a personal recommendation can go a long way in sealing the deal. Step 5: Explore Social Media Platforms Social media is a powerful tool for meeting new people, especially during this digital era. Utilize various platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, to broaden your horizons. Join groups, participate in discussions, and interact with others who share your interests. Be open to forming new connections, as they could potentially lead to your ideal partner. Step 6: Try Online Dating Services Online dating websites and apps have revolutionized the way we connect with potential romantic partners. Tailored specifically for gay men, platforms like Grindr, SCRUFF, and OkCupid offer extensive options for meeting people who share your interests. Create an attractive profile, be honest and clear about your intentions, and engage in meaningful conversations to locate the one you desire. Conclusion Finding your ideal boyfriend as a gay man may take time, but with determination and patience, you can successfully navigate the dating world. Focus on understanding your preferences, embrace the opportunities presented by social media and online dating services, and maintain a positive attitude throughout the journey. Your special someone might just be around the corner. So, stay open, and continue seeking the fulfilling relationship you deserve."},{"prompt":"This article: Tom is chasing Jerry around Mammy Two Shoes, while she is yelling out confusing instructions on where to chase Jerry.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Where were sixty thousand more were sold in 2005? ? The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost. However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network. Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas. There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me. The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad.

It's important to drink eight to 10 8-ounce glasses of water a day. This keeps the discharge thin and more fluid, making it easier to drain.","completion":"Chronic sinusitis is a common condition where the cavities around nasal passages (sinuses) become inflamed and swollen for at least 12 weeks, despite treatment attempts. Treating chronic sinusitis is essential to alleviate discomfort, ensure proper sinus function, and prevent complications. In addition to drinking eight to 10 glasses of water a day, there is a range of other treatments and recommendations that can help manage and, ideally, resolve this condition. 1. Medical treatment: Seek advice from your healthcare professional regarding appropriate medications to alleviate symptoms and address any infections. This may include: - Nasal corticosteroids: These nasal sprays can help reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms. - Saline nasal irrigation: A saltwater solution can be used to clear the nasal passages and reduce congestion. - Oral or injected corticosteroids: In severe cases, physicians may prescribe oral or injected corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. - Antibiotics: If a bacterial infection is present, your doctor may suggest antibiotics for treatment. - Antifungal medications: In cases of fungal infections, antifungal medication may be prescribed. 2. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications: Some OTC medications, such as decongestants or antihistamines, can help relieve symptoms. However, long-term use may cause side effects. Consult your healthcare provider before starting any OTC medications. 3. Lifestyle changes and home remedies: - Use a humidifier: Adding moisture to the air can help to soothe irritated nasal passages and reduce sinus congestion. - Practice good hygiene: Regular handwashing and avoiding contact with individuals who have colds or respiratory infections can reduce the risk of sinus infections. - Avoid irritants: Tobacco smoke, pollution, or allergens can worsen sinusitis symptoms, so try to minimize exposure to these irritants. - Apply warm compresses: Warm compresses applied to the face can help relieve pain and reduce inflammation. - Refrain from alcohol consumption: Alcohol can worsen sinusitis symptoms by contributing to dehydration and increasing sinus inflammation. 4. Allergy management: If you have allergies, leading to chronic sinusitis, consider working with an allergist or immunologist. Immunotherapy, allergy shots, or oral sublingual tablets can help desensitize your immune system to specific allergens and reduce symptoms. 5. Alternative therapies: Some individuals find relief from chronic sinusitis through alternative therapies such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, or homeopathy. However, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional before starting any alternative treatment. 6. Surgical intervention: In cases where conservative treatments don't help or when structural abnormalities are contributing to chronic sinusitis, surgery may be necessary. Endoscopic sinus surgery involves removing obstructions or correcting structural issues to improve sinus drainage and function. It is essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to your specific needs and circumstances. In addition, maintaining a healthy lifestyle by staying hydrated, managing stress, exercising, and focusing on a balanced diet can also improve your body's ability to manage chronic sinusitis.

President Barack Obama's choice for the No. 2 job at the Homeland Security Department is under investigation for his role in helping a company run by Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony Rodham. Alejandro Mayorkas, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, is being investigated for his role in helping the company secure an international investor visa for a Chinese executive, according to congressional officials briefed on the investigation. Anthony Rodham is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean, Va. Under investigation: Alejandro Mayorkas, who is being probed, (pictured far right) stood with President Obama and Director of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano (center) in March 2013 at the White House. The officials spoke only on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details of the investigation. Mayorkas was named by Homeland Security's Inspector General's Office as a target in an investigation involving the foreign investor program run by USCIS, according to an email sent to lawmakers late Monday, Associated Press has learned. In that email, the IG's office said,'At this point in our investigation, we do not have any findings of criminal misconduct.' The email did not specify any criminal allegations it might be investigating. White House press secretary Jay Carney referred questions to the inspector general's office, which said that the probe is in its preliminary stage and that it doesn't comment on the specifics of investigations. The program, known as EB-5, allows foreigners to get visas if they invest 500,000 to 1 million in projects or businesses that create jobs for U.S. citizens. The amount of the investment required depends on the type of project. Investors who are approved for the program can become legal permanent residents after two years and can later be eligible to become citizens. Clinton connections: Hillary Clinton's brother Anthony Rodham (pictured right with his bride Nicole Boxer in 1999) is president and CEO of Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC in McLean, Va. If Mayorkas were confirmed as Homeland Security's deputy secretary, he probably would run the department until a permanent replacement was approved to take over for departing Secretary Janet Napolitano. The email to lawmakers said the primary complaint against Mayorkas was that he helped a financing company run by Anthony Rodham, a brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton, to win approval for an investor visa, even after the application was denied and an appeal was rejected. Mayorkas, a former U.S. attorney in California, previously came under criticism for his involvement in the commutation by President Bill Clinton of the prison sentence of the son of a Democratic Party donor. Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham, had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. Mayorkas told lawmakers during his 2009 confirmation hearing that 'it was a mistake' to talk to the White House about the request. Hillary Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state on Feb. 1, is considered a possible contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. According to the Inspector General's email, the investigation of the investor visa program also includes allegations that other USCIS Office of General Counsel officials obstructed an audit of the visa program by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The email did not name any specific official from the general counsel's office. Family ties: Another of Hillary Clinton's brothers, Hugh Rodham (pictured with Bill Clinton in 1999) had been hired by the donor to lobby for the commutation. The email says investigators did not know whether Mayorkas was aware of the investigation. The FBI's Washington Field Office was told about the investigation in June after it inquired about Mayorkas as part of the White House background investigation for his nomination as deputy DHS secretary. The FBI in Washington has been concerned about the investor visa program and the projects funded by foreign sources since at least March, according to emails obtained by The AP. The bureau wanted details of all of the limited liability companies that had invested in the EB-5 visa program. Of particular concern, the FBI official wrote, was Chinese investment in projects, including the building of an FBI facility. 'Let's just say that we have a significant issue that my higher ups are really concerned about and this may be addressed way above my pay grade,' an official wrote in one email. The FBI official's name was redacted in that email. Appointed by Obama: Alejandro Mayorkas is director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent the FBI a lengthy letter Tuesday asking for details of its review of the foreign investor visa program and Chinese investment in U.S. infrastructure projects. Chinese investment in infrastructure projects has long been a concern of the U.S. government. In September, the Obama administration blocked a Chinese company from owning four wind farm projects in northern Oregon that were near a Navy base used to fly unmanned drones and electronic-warfare planes on training missions. And in October, the House Intelligence Committee warned that two leading Chinese technology firms, Huawei Technologies Ltd. and ZTE Corp., posed a major security threat to the U.S. Both firms have denied being influenced by the Chinese government. The most routine users of the EB-5 program are Chinese investors. According to an undated, unclassified State Department report about the program obtained by the AP, the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China, processed more investor visas in the 2011 fiscal year than any other consulate or embassy. The document says 'applicants are usually coached and prepped for their interviews, making it difficult to take at face value applicants' claims' about where their money comes from and whether they hold membership in the Chinese Communist Party. Party membership would make an applicant ineligible for the investor visa. Gulf Coast Funds Management LLC is one of hundreds of 'Regional Centers' that pool investments from foreign nationals looking to invest in U.S. businesses or industries as part of the foreign investor visa program. There was no immediate response to an email sent to Gulf Coast requesting comment. It is unclear from the IG's email why the investor visa application was denied. Visa requests can be denied for a number of reasons, including a circumstance where an applicant has a criminal background or is considered a threat to national security or public safety.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries.

Now, US scientists have discovered not only does retail therapy exist,but that it could be caused by an individual's fear of sudden death. Researchers found materialistic people thought terrorism and war more stressful than others. Psychologists believe the rise of materialism around the world and its treatment effect on extreme stress might be a response to fear of death caused by acts of terrorism, disease and natural disasters. The scientists from Michigan State University said people with possession obsessions often have lower self-esteem than others so are more likely to shop as the result of severe psychological suffering. Ayalla Ruvio,a business professor studying people's shopping habits while rockets fell in Israel, said, \\"When the going gets tough, the materialistic people go shopping. This stress spending is likely to produce even greater stress and lower well-being. Essentially, materialism appears to make bad events even worse. Dr Ruvio led a two-part study of Israeli citizens living in a town that came under extreme rocket attacks for about six months in 2007. She compared 139 residents of the southern town with 170 from another town that was not under attack to see how their symptoms of post-traumatic stress and shopping habits varied. Dr Ruvio found that, when faced with a deadly threat, those who are highly materialistic suffered much higher levels of stress,while their tendency to shop was increased. Dr Ruvio said, \\"The relationship between materialism and stress may be more harmful than commonly thought.\\" The second stage of their research surveyed 855 Americans about their materialistic nature and fear of death. They found shopping was used to relieve feelings of stress and anxiety about death but this was in response to fear of a variety of life-threatening events like car accidents, criminal attacks and natural disasters.

Mary had an arrogant professor. Mary's accounting class had started off on a rocky note. Unlike Felicia, who was enjoying her time in school and felt motivated in her class, Mary was struggling to keep up with the material her instructor presented. It wasn't that Mary couldn't understand accounting or that she wasn't smart enough - it was simply because her professor was making things difficult. Step 1: Highlight the challenges faced by Mary because of her arrogant professor. --- Mary's professor, Mr. Johnson, displayed a high degree of arrogance. He believed that he was the ultimate authority on accounting and that no one else's input or questions had any value. Whenever Mary or her classmates asked questions in class, Mr. Johnson would dismiss them as irrelevant or not important. He refused to provide further clarification when asked to explain complex concepts, making it difficult for the students to comprehend the subject matter. Step 2: Show how the situation affects Mary's confidence and performance. --- Mary's confidence began to falter under his sardonic remarks and dismissive attitude. As the semester progressed, Mary found herself dreading the class and losing her passion for accounting. She started avoiding asking questions, even when she didn't understand certain topics, for fear of being belittled in front of her peers. Consequently, Mary's overall class performance began to suffer. Step 3: Introduce a moment of hope or an opportunity for Mary to overcome the challenges. --- One day, after another humiliating encounter with Mr. Johnson in class, Mary decided to approach Felicia for help. Feeling vulnerable, she opened up to her friend about her struggles and sought advice. Felicia, being the kind and supportive friend that she was, decided to assist Mary by sharing her notes and study techniques. Step 4: Show how Mary's hard work and determination pay off. --- With Felicia's unwavering support, Mary started studying harder than ever before. She practiced accounting problems for hours on end, determined to understand and apply the concepts she had missed. She refused to let Mr. Johnson's arrogance hinder her growth and love for accounting. Step 5: Demonstrate the resolution or achievement by Mary. --- Eventually, Mary's hard work paid off. Despite Mr. Johnson's arrogance and unhelpful demeanor, she managed to grasp the material and excel in her studies. When the final exams came, Mary not only passed the course but scored one of the highest marks in her class. In the end, Mary overcame the challenges posed by her arrogant professor and reaffirmed her passion for accounting. This experience taught her that she could overcome any obstacle, even those created by the most formidable of adversaries, as long as she believed in herself and had the right support system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: The American Medical Association may throw its clout behind sales and advertising bans of “high-energy/stimulant drinks” to young people under age 18, pending more scientific study about health risks. A debate schedule for this weekend by the AMA’s policy-making House of Delegates comes amid intensifying scrutiny of energy drinks, which are popular particularly among young adults who get a boost from caffeine and other ingredients in the beverages. But a resolution from the New York State Medical Society that will be discussed at this year’s annual AMA meeting in Chicago cites an increase in emergency room visits the physicians said was “linked to the consumption of ‘stimulant’ drinks.” Doctors have also cited probes like that of the New York State Attorney General’s investigation into drink makers that include Monster Beverage Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST) and PepsiCo PepsiCo Inc. (PEP). Though any action this weekend by the AMA’s policy-making House of Delegates has no legal authority over the sale of high-energy drinks, the national doctor’s group has a bully pulpit on public health issues. The AMA is also considered a powerful lobby in Washington and in state capitols across the county where it holds sway when it comes to medical policy and health regulations. “The popularity of stimulant drinks has increased markedly in recent years with sales increasing 240 percent from 2004-2009, with further data indicating that these drinks are consumed by 30 to 50 percent of children, adolescents, and young adults,” the New York delegation to the AMA House of delegates said in its resolution. “Studies have shown that high ‘stimulant’ drinks contain excessive amounts of caffeine with one can having the equivalent of up to 50 cups of coffee. Excessive caffeine can cause adverse effects such as dizziness, insomnia, agitation, restlessness, anxiety, GI disturbances, myocardial infarction and death.” Any push by the AMA could meet resistance from drink makers. Monster, for example, earlier this year has fought back against curbs on sales of its drinks such as a suit it filed against the San Francisco City Attorney this spring. Monster has also said labeling on its drinks caution that the beverages are “not recommended for children, pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine,” according to an April report in the Wall Street Journal linked here. The resolution regarding energy drinks is among dozens that will be debated at the AMA’s 524-member House of Delegates, which convenes Saturday to Wednesday at the Hyatt Regency Chicago. Aside from endorsing a ban on such drinks, AMA delegates are also pushing for more scientific study of energy drinks. On June 18, the AMA’s policy-making House of Delegates adopted policy supporting a ban on the marketing, but not on the sale of “high stimulant/caffeine drinks to adolescents under the age of 18. Here’s a link to AMA statement on the new policy. Said AMA board member Dr. Alexander Ding, “Energy drinks contain massive and excessive amounts of caffeine that may lead to a host of health problems in young people, including heart problems, and banning companies from marketing these products to adolescents is a common sense action that we can take to protect the health of American kids.” ||||| Doctors To Vote On Whether Cheerleading Is A Sport Enlarge this image toggle caption Charlie Neibergall/AP Charlie Neibergall/AP This weekend the American Medical Association will kick off its annual exercise in medical democracy. The group's House of Delegates will meet in Chicago to vote on resolutions that range from a demand that private insurers pay doctors at least as much as Medicare does to a call for federal legislation affirming the right of doctors to talk about gun safety with patients. Oh, and one other thing, the Illinois delegation is putting forward a resolution asking the AMA to \\"support the designation of cheerleading as a sport.\\" Yep, you read that right. And the health logic is pretty straightforward, actually. Cheerleading has become a competitive activity in its own right, and there's a considerable risk of serious injury, including concussion, spinal damage and broken bones. What Should The AMA Do? Should cheerleading be considered a sport? So it ought to get the same attention to health consequences as other sports, including the training of coaches to minimize injury risks for cheerleaders, proponents say. A 2011 report from the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research found that \\"high school and college cheerleaders account for approximately two-thirds of the catastrophic injuries to female athletes.\\" The NCAA hasn't recognized cheerleading as a competitive sport. Last August, a federal appeals court ruled that Quinnipiac College in Connecticut couldn't count cheerleading as a sport under Title IX as way to offset disbanding women's volleyball. If the AMA delegates go along with the proposal, they'll be following in the footsteps of the pediatricians. Last October, The American Academy of Pediatrics called for more attention to cheerleading injuries and giving the go-ahead to the sports label. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The American Medical Association (AMA) has been discussing the possibility of supporting sales and advertising bans of high-energy and stimulant drinks to young people under the age of 18, citing the need for further scientific study on the potential health risks associated with these beverages.

Write a sentence based on \\"crisis-hit latvia contemplates deeper cuts\\"","completion":"In the face of an economic crisis, Latvia, one of the European countries hardest hit by it, is seriously contemplating implementing even more stringent measures in a contentious bid to stabilize the economy; these measures may include deeper cutbacks in public spending and further austerity measures. These radical steps are seen as a way to ward off financial insolvency and to reassure wary foreign investors and institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. The move, however, has elicited a mixed response from the populace and pundits. Advocates of the cuts argue that, though painful, they are an inevitable and necessary step in order to stem the country's financial collapse. They argue that by tightening the belt now, Latvia can bolster its economic outlook by controlling expanding national debt and paving the way for a stronger economy in the future. Advocates also point out that Latvia has no other plausible choice to escape the downward spiral of economic collapse; international lenders like the International Monetary Fund or the European Union can only provide conditional aid, typically contingent upon such severe fiscal restraints. On the flip side, critics argue that such severe cuts risk exacerbating the recession and deepening social inequity. They warn that the ongoing contraction of the Latvian economy – most acutely represented by the increasing unemployment, wage reduction, and escalation of poverty – could precipitate a deeper, longer economic downturn that may push Latvia into a near-depression state. Critics contend that such austerity measures would disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups of society, escalating wealth disparity and social inequity. Some political commentators have voiced concern over the potential implications for the nation's social fabric and political stability. By imposing deeper cuts, there's a risk of fanning social unrest and exacerbating discontent amongst the populace, which could lead to even more significant problems in the long run. The government, however, appears resolute in its decision to implement further cuts, arguing that the alternative—defaulting on its debts—would have catastrophic implications not just for Latvia, but for the global financial system as a whole. Thus, despite the mounting social, economic, and political pressure, Latvia remains fixed in its contemplation of deeper cuts, reflecting the sheer severity of the crisis it faces. In conclusion, while the Latvian government's move to implement deeper cuts in response to its ongoing economic crisis is a clear testament to the severity of the situation, it also opens up a larger discussion about the ramifications of such measures on the social and economic fabric of the country, an issue that will likely continue to reverberate far into Latvia's future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The first quarter was all field goals, as Dallas scored first with a 41-yarder by Dan Bailey, followed by a 23-yarder for the Vikings by Blair Walsh. In the second quarter, Bailey made another field goal from 44 yards to put the Cowboys up by 3, but the Vikings took a 10-6 lead into halftime, capping the ensuing 79-yard drive with a 6-yard run by Ponder. After the half, Cowboy quarterback Tony Romo completed two consecutive 26-yard passes to tight end Jason Witten to give them an early touchdown and restore their three-point lead. On the very next play from scrimmage, Ponder fumbled the ball as he was sacked in the end zone, and the Cowboys' Nick Hayden recovered it for a touchdown, meaning the Vikings went from 10-6 up to 20-10 down in the space of two scrimmage plays. The Vikings responded immediately with a quick, six-play drive, culminating with a 31-yard pass from Ponder to Kyle Rudolph to cut the Cowboys' lead back to three points. After a series of punts going into the fourth quarter, Adrian Peterson scored for the Vikings with an 11-yard run with almost six minutes to go, but Walsh pushed the extra point kick wide right, giving the Vikings a three-point lead over the Cowboys. Vikings cornerback A. J. Jefferson intercepted Romo on the Cowboys' ensuing drive, putting the Vikings in a position to potentially take over the game, but the offense went three-and-out and was forced to punt. The Cowboys progressed downfield quickly, never faced with a third down, and scored with a 7-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Dwayne Harris, the third time the Vikings had given up a game-winning score in 2013.

We have this equation: -11 = -5*o + 9 Now, we want to find the number 'o'. To do this, follow these steps: 1. Move the 9 from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do this, we subtract 9 from both sides of the equation: -11 - 9 = -5*o + 9 - 9 2. Now, our equation will look like this: -20 = -5*o 3. To find 'o', we need to divide both sides of the equation by -5. This is because we want to get 'o' by itself: (-20) / (-5) = (-5*o) / (-5) 4. After dividing, our equation will now look like this: 4 = o So, 'o' is equal to 4.

Rouvas was born on 5 January 1972 in the village of Mandoukion, near Corfu City on the island of Corfu, the eldest of four sons of Konstantinos \\"Kostas\\" Rouvas (an ambulance driver) and the teenaged Anna-Maria Panaretou (a duty-free shop clerk at the local airport). He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. After moving to Patras, Rouvas continued to look for performance opportunities until he met Dakis (a popular Greek artist who was the first person to help him professionally). Rouvas moved to Athens, and made his first professional appearance in 1991 at the Show Centre. His showmanship attracted the attention of music executives such as Nikos Mouratidis, who encouraged songwriter Giorgos Pavrianos to produce him. Rouvas, singing Michael Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\" was discovered by PolyGram executives who signed him to his first recording contract. After moving to Athens he lived with an older English woman named Sally, with whom he had begun a relationship on Corfu. Their relationship ended when Psinakis became Rouvas' manager, and the singer became more career-oriented. The media has speculated about Rouvas' personal life and relationships with model Zeta Logotheti, Sofi Kantarou (a Corfu bar manager) and singer Elli Kokkinou. Several months later he debuted at the Thessaloniki Song Festival, losing Best Vocal Performance to Giorgos Alkaios but singing the Best Composition (\\"Par'ta\\"; \\"Take Them\\", with music by Nikos Terzis and lyrics by Giorgos Pavrianos). There was a brief earthquake during the festival. Rouvas released his eponymous debut album, which topped the Greek Albums Chart, the day after the festival. \\"Par'ta\\" became a radio hit, and other songs of the album such as \\"1992\\", \\"Ego S'agapo\\" (\\"I Love You\\") and \\"Gia Fantasou\\" (\\"Imagine\\") also became popular. In September 1992 Rouvas released his second album, Min Andistekese (Don't Resist), also composed by Nikos Terzis. It produced the singles \\"Gyrna\\" (\\"Return\\"), \\"Min Andistekese\\", \\"Na Ziseis Moro Mou\\" (\\"Live, My Baby\\") and \\"Me Kommeni Tin Anasa\\" (\\"Breathless\\"), with a music video of the title track. The album's success helped establish Rouvas at the top of the Greek music scene. In October 1993 Rouvas released his third album, Gia Sena (For You), with music by Alexis Papadimitriou and lyrics by Eleni Giannatsoulia and Evi Droutsa. The single \\"Kane Me\\" (\\"Make Me\\") became a radio hit, with \\"To Xero Eisai Moni\\" (\\"I Know You Are Alone\\") and \\"Xehase To\\" (\\"Forget It\\") also receiving airplay.

But the move was overturned in a Commons vote, by 303 votes to 253 - a government majority of 50. The government said it would be wrong to alter the \\"tried and tested\\" general election franchise for a single poll. But Labour, the SNP and Lib Dems all favour allowing 16 and 17-year-olds - who were allowed to take part in last year's referendum on Scottish independence - to vote on whether to remain in the EU. Labour's shadow foreign secretary, Hilary Benn, said the government's decision to block the move was \\"wrong-headed and unfair\\". Speaker John Bercow certified that the changes proposed by the House of Lords were covered by \\"financial privilege\\" rules, because the government had estimated that it would cost about Â£6m to implement. These rules can be used by the House of Commons \\"as grounds for overruling any House of Lords proposal that has cost implications\\". But BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Labour peers still hoped to force the government to lower the voting age, and would table a fresh motion that did not fall foul of the rules, on Monday. No date has been set for the referendum, but David Cameron has promised to hold it by the end of 2017.

What is the best way to: how do you turn off the alarm on a car with the remote.","completion":"The best way to turn off the alarm on a car using the remote depends on the specific make and model of the vehicle, as well as the type of remote being used. However, here are some general guidelines to help you understand the process: 1. Identify the correct remote: Ensure that you have the correct remote for your vehicle, as many remotes are brand-specific and may not work with other vehicle models. In most cases, the remote that came with your car will be the appropriate one to use. 2. Locate the disarm or lock button: Look for a button on the remote with an icon of a locked padlock or one that says \\"disarm\\" or \\"unlock.\\" This button is typically used for disarming the vehicle's security system and unlocking the doors. 3. Stand within range of the vehicle: Make sure you are within the specified range specified by the manufacturer for the remote to effectively communicate with the vehicle. This is typically around 30 to 100 feet. 4. Point the remote towards the vehicle: Direct the remote towards the vehicle, ensuring that there are no obstructions between the remote and the car. 5. Press the disarm/lock button: Press the disarm or lock button once, and hold it for one to three seconds. Most car alarms will turn off and the vehicle's lights will flash, indicating that the alarm has been disarmed. 6. Check for confirmation: After pressing the disarm/lock button, wait for a confirmation signal, such as a flashing of the vehicle's lights or an audible chirp. This indicates that the alarm has been successfully turned off. 7. Unlock the doors: If your remote has a separate button for unlocking the doors, press this button once the alarm has been disarmed to unlock the doors and gain access to the vehicle. 8. Manual override (if necessary): If the remote does not successfully disarm the alarm, you may need to use a key to manually unlock the door and start the vehicle. Inserting the key in the ignition and turning it to the \\"on\\" position may reset the alarm system, allowing you to turn off the alarm. 9. If problems persist, consult the vehicle's owner manual: If the above steps do not work, refer to the owner's manual for your specific vehicle make and model to find the recommended procedure for disarming the alarm system. 10. Seek professional help, if needed: If the alarm cannot be disarmed following these steps and the suggestions in the owner's manual, consider contacting an automotive locksmith or the dealership for assistance. They can help diagnose and fix any issues that may be preventing you from disarming the car alarm. Remember that the exact procedure may vary depending on your specific vehicle and remote, so always consult your vehicle's owner manual or contact the manufacturer for the most accurate information on disarming your car's alarm system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A man went to a place called a nightclub with his friends to have some fun. A nightclub is a big room where people go to dance, listen to music, and enjoy time together. While the man was there, something not nice happened. Another person at the nightclub got very angry and did a mean thing. That person punched the man, just one time, but it was very hard. This punch, like when you hit something with your fist, hurt the man very much. He got very, very sick, and his body didn't work the way it was supposed to anymore. His family and friends were very worried, and they took him to a place called a hospital. A hospital is a special place where doctors and nurses help people get better when they're sick. The man's daddy wanted to let other daddies and mommies know how bad it is to hit someone, even if you're angry or upset. So, he decided to show other people a picture, called a photograph, of his son in the hospital. The photograph showed his son in a bed, full of machines that were helping him feel better. The dad hoped that by sharing this photograph, other people would look at it and remember to be nice and kind to each other, even when they get angry. He wanted people to learn from his son's story, so they don't have to feel the same pain his son and their family felt. He also wanted everyone to know how important it is to be careful and respectful when they go to places like a nightclub.

Does word \\"pain\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? Your mother is a right pain. That kid is a terrible pain.","completion":"Yes, the word \\"pain\\" essentially carries the same connotation in both sentences but it's being used in an idiomatic context, more specifically a colloquial expression rather than its literal meaning. This idiomatic usage is indicating that someone is annoying or a source of bother rather than inferring physical discomfort or distress. In the sentence \\"Your mother is a right pain,\\" it suggests that the person's mother is perceived as annoying, bothersome, or is causing some sort of mental stress, irritation or inconvenience to the speaker. For instance, the person may feel like the mother is somewhat intrusive, controlling, excessively worrying, or perhaps failing to respect their boundaries, rendering the individual to find her presence or behavioral traits burdensome. The second sentence \\"That kid is a terrible pain\\" employs the word \\"pain\\" in a similar sense. Here, it is suggesting that the mentioned kid is found to be highly bothersome or annoying by the speaker. This could be because the kid is acting naughtily, is excessively noisy, is disobedient, or is engaging in some sort of behavior that the speaker finds disruptive or distressing. The use of the word \\"terrible\\" enhances the degree of annoyance or inconvenience, indicating that the kid is not just a mild irritation, but a significant nuisance. So, while the specific source and nature of annoyance may vary from situation to situation, the core connotation of the word \\"pain\\" as an expression of strong inconvenience, bother, or annoyance remains consistent in both sentences. It's worth noting that this usage is quite informal and metaphorical, and typically seen in casual conversation. It's important to note that language is complex, nuanced and context-dependent. The personal relationship with the person referred to as a \\"pain\\", the situation, the tone and other contextual factors can add layers of emotion and connotation to the meaning of these sentences beyond the basic definition of the word \\"pain\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There isn't a major documentary, very puzzling. Fortunately we are graced with the talent of Ben Coccio who directed ZERO DAY, and Gus Van Sant who did the equally fine ELEPHANT. Two different takes on the event, which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery, that there's something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers, and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality.

However, a more detailed and long answer would be as follows: The Watergate scandal started with the break-in at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters in Washington on June 17, 1972. A group of burglars, who were later discovered to be connected with President Richard Nixon's re-election campaign, were arrested for breaking into the DNC offices and attempting to wiretap the phones. The burglars were later identified as former CIA operatives and former FBI agents. This break-in was only the tip of the iceberg, as it soon became clear that it was connected to a much larger web of illegal actions and abuses of power by the Nixon administration. The scandal was further fueled by the revelation that there was a secret White House taping system that had recorded conversations and discussions related to the break-in and its cover-up. Nixon was accused of several wrongdoings, which can be summed up in the following points: 1. Obstruction of Justice: President Nixon and his administration attempted to cover up their involvement in the break-in and other illegal activities throughout the investigation. This included the payment of hush money to the burglars, destruction of evidence, and interference with the FBI's investigation. 2. Abuse of Power: Nixon was accused of using his presidential powers for personal and political gain by ordering the break-in to collect information on the DNC and their election strategies. Additionally, Nixon had misused government agencies, such as the FBI, CIA, and IRS, to harass political opponents and gain control over them. 3. Contempt of Congress: Nixon refused to comply with subpoenas issued by the congressional committee investigating the scandal, leading to his being charged with contempt of Congress. As the investigation progressed, and as more evidence of Nixon's involvement in the break-in and cover-up was revealed, his support in Congress diminished. Facing an almost certain impeachment and removal from office, on August 8, 1974, President Nixon announced his resignation, becoming the first U.S. president to resign from office. The Watergate scandal had significant implications on American politics and public trust in the government, leading to various reforms aimed at increasing government transparency and accountability."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: OPT: (1). sulfide; (2). carbonate; (3). fermite; (4). halide; A:","completion":"When salt water evaporates, it leads to the formation of a specific group of minerals known as evaporite minerals. These minerals are formed due to the precipitation of dissolved ions in the saltwater as it loses water content. The process of evaporation concentrates the minerals in the remaining water, resulting in the crystallization of these minerals. The most common evaporite minerals formed by this process can be categorized into the following groups: 1. Halide minerals: Halides are compounds in which one or more halogen elements, such as chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I), combine with a metal ion. In the context of salt water evaporation, the most common halide mineral that forms is halite (NaCl), commonly known as rock salt. Halite is a natural source of sodium chloride and is widely used in various industries, including food processing, agriculture, and chemical production. Other halide minerals include sylvite (KCl), which is an important source of potassium, and carnallite (KMgCl3·6H2O), which is a hydrated magnesium-potassium chloride. 2. Sulfate minerals: Sulfate minerals are characterized by the presence of an anion group (SO4)2-. After halides, sulfates are the second most common group of evaporite minerals. Gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O), anhydrite (CaSO4), and epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O) are some of the common evaporite sulfate minerals. Gypsum has various commercial applications, such as in the production of plaster and cement, while anhydrite is used as a soil amendment and in the production of sulfuric acid. Epsomite, also known as Epsom salt, is used in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and as a bath salt. 3. Carbonate minerals: While carbonate minerals are not as commonly formed by saltwater evaporation as halides and sulfates, they may still occur in certain conditions. Carbonates contain a carbonate ion (CO3)2- that combines with a metal ion. Some of the common carbonate evaporite minerals include calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite [CaMg(CO3)2]. These minerals can play a significant role in the formation of sedimentary rocks like limestone and dolostone. 4. Borate minerals: Borate evaporite minerals, which contain the borate anion (BO3)3-, occur less frequently in comparison to the other evaporite minerals. However, they are still an important group of minerals due to their industrial applications. Borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O) and kernite (Na2B4O7·4H2O) are two common borate minerals that can be found in evaporite deposits. Borate minerals are used in various applications, such as detergents, glass manufacturing, and as a flame retardant. The formation of these evaporite minerals through the evaporation of saltwater is a natural process, and these minerals can be extracted from vast deposits called salt pans, salt flats, or salt beds. The concentration of minerals in saltwater, along with various environmental factors, can influence the types and quantities of evaporite minerals formed during the evaporation process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(WJZ)– Montgomery County police in Maryland continue to look for a pregnant teacher who didn’t show up for the first day of class. Police say Olney resident, Laura Elizabeth Wallen, 31, last contacted family members by text message on Monday. Wallen failed to show up for the first day of classes Tuesday at Wilde Lake High School in Columbia, where she teaches history and law. “She was a favorite amongst the students. She was really nice and this is really sad, what’s happening, you see it’s really taking a toll on people,” said student Paris Cooper. Relatives of Wallen confirmed that she was excited about her pregnancy, never gave signs that anything was bothering her and left her dog behind. “I’m hoping they find her and I’m hoping that she’ll be alive and well,” said neighbor Joyce Robinson. Police won’t reveal the context of the text message she sent the family. “That was alarming enough that the family said ‘we need to call police,'” Sgt. Rebecca Innocenti said. Wallen spent days preparing her classroom, which makes it unusual that she didn’t show up. She earned honors as senior class teacher last year. “People are concerned for her safety,” said Brian Bassett of Howard County Schools. “I know she’s really highly regarded at Wilde Lake High School.” Students flooded social media using the hashtag #BringWallenHome. Wallen is 5-foot-5-inches tall, weighs 200 pounds and has blonde hair and blue eyes. Police are also looking for her car, a black 2011 Ford Escape with Maryland license plate M522473.

Help as much as you can. The influence of what can be seen as in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Bertin portrait has been hugely influential. At first it served as a model for depictions of energetic and intellectual 19th-century men, and later as a more universal type. Several 1890s works closely echo its form and motifs. Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant's monochrome and severe 1896 Portrait of Alfred Chauchard is heavily indebted, while Léon Bonnat's stern 1892 portrait of the aging Ernest Renan has been described as a \\"direct citation\\" of Ingres' portrait. Its influence can be seen in the dismissive stare and overwhelming physical presence of the sitter in Pablo Picasso's 1906 Portrait of Gertrude Stein. Picasso admired Ingres and referred to him throughout his career. His invoking of Bertin can be read as a humorous reference to, according to Robert Rosenblum, \\"Stein's ponderous bulk and sexual preference\\". Stein does not possess Bertin's ironic stare, but is similarly dressed in black, and leans forward in an imposing manner, the painting emphasising her \\"massive, monumental presence\\". In 1907 the Swiss artist Félix Vallotton depicted Stein, in response to Picasso, making an even more direct reference to Ingres' portrait, prompting Édouard Vuillard to exclaim, \\"That's Madame Bertin!\\"The influence continued through the 20th century. Gerald Kelly recalled Bertin when painting his restless and confined series of portraits of Ralph Vaughan Williams between 1952 and 1961. In 1975 Marcel Broodthaers produced a series of nine black and white photographs on board based on Ingres' portraits of Bertin and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière.

Question: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of this story, Rialto Bridge's is probably: Options: A. still new B.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia. - Nuclear Assault is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed after bassist Dan Lilker left Anthrax in 1984. After releasing five full-length albums and touring relentlessly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Nuclear Assault split up in 1995. They briefly reunited in 1997 and again in 2002, and are still active today. - Dimmu Borgir (or or ) is a Norwegian symphonic black metal band from Oslo, Norway, formed in 1993. The name is derived from Dimmuborgir, a volcanic formation in Iceland, the name of which means \\"dark cities\\" or \\"dark castles/fortresses\\" in Icelandic, Faroese and Old Norse. The band has been through numerous lineup changes over the years; guitarist Silenoz and vocalist Shagrath are the only original members who still remain with guitarist Galder being a longstanding member. - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that originated in the early to mid-1980s. It draws inspiration from some of the most abrasive-sounding genres including hardcore punk, thrash metal, crust punk, industrial, death metal and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm Death are credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It is a densely populated country located in Western Europe with three island territories in the Caribbean. The European part of the Netherlands borders Germany to the east, Belgium to the south, and the North Sea to the northwest, sharing maritime borders with Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The largest cities in the Netherlands are Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. Amsterdam is the country's capital, while The Hague holds the Dutch seat of government and parliament.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? To prepare homemade lox, you’ll need 1 ½ to 2 pounds (680 to 907 g) of boneless salmon fillet with the skin on. Run some cold water in the sink and rinse the fillet well. Next, examine the fillet to make sure that all of the bones have been removed. You can purchase either \\"belly lox\\" or regular \\"lox\\" fillets. Both are salmon, but belly lox comes from the stomach region of the fish. The graining of fat in the stomach region makes belly lox the better option to use when you make lox because it is more widely spaced. This results in a final product that is more desirable and less salty. If there are any pin bones left in the salmon fillet, use a small pair of tweezers or pliers to pull them out in the same direction that they’re facing. Pin bones are more likely to occur in wild salmon than farmed salmon. Once the salmon is thoroughly rinsed, use a sharp knife to cut the fillet in half. Make sure that the pieces are as equal in size as you can get them. Add 1 cup (288 g) of kosher salt and 1 cup (200 g) of sugar to a medium bowl. Mix the ingredients together well so they’re fully blended. If you like, you can also add about ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of coarsely ground black pepper to the mixture. Place the two pieces of salmon in a shallow dish so they’re side by side. Pour an equal amount of the salt mixture over each piece, piling it right on top of the salmon. It may seem that there is a lot of excess salt mixture on the salmon, but the fish will absorb it during the curing process. After you’ve added the salt mixture to the salmon pieces, divide half a bunch of dill with the stems removed between them and add it on top of the salt. Next, place one of the salmon pieces on top of the other, being careful not to knock off the salt mixture. When the salmon pieces are sandwiched together, carefully wrap them in plastic wrap. Once the fish is secure in the plastic wrap, set it in a large plastic zipper bag. Before closing the zipper bag, be sure to push all of the air out of it first. Set the bag with the salmon down in a shallow dish. Place another heavy dish on top of the bag to weigh it down, and refrigerate the fish for 2 to 3 days. You can use any heavy item, such as a bottle of wine, to weigh down the salmon. While you’re curing the salmon, it’s important to keep it from getting soggy. Remove any liquid that’s been extracted from the salmon from the plastic bag and flip the fish over so both sides are evenly weighed down. At the two day mark, begin tasting the lox. Once it has the taste that desire, you can take it out of the curing container and unwrap it. If the lox isn’t properly cured after two days, you should leave in the container for another day. After you’ve removed the fish from the plastic wrap, rinse it well under cold water to remove any residue. Use a sharp knife to cut it thin on the bias. Make sure to leave the skin behind. You can freeze the lox if you don’t plan to eat all of it right away. Wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer bag for storage. You should eat it within 3 to 4 months.","completion":"This article provides a step-by-step guide to making homemade lox using boneless salmon fillet, a salt and sugar mixture, dill, and a curing process of 2-3 days in the refrigerator before slicing and consuming, with the option to freeze and store for up to 4 months."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Minerals become common happens, how will it affect MORE minerals forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed suggests that if minerals become more common, it would affect the formation of MORE minerals. In the context of the described process, the abundance of minerals does not have a direct effect on the formation of new minerals. The process you mentioned involves the cooling of magma, which leads to the formation of crystals containing minerals. This process is primarily driven by the cooling of magma and the movement of particles inside it rather than the abundance or scarcity of minerals. However, an indirect effect can be considered. If minerals become more common, it might suggest that there is an increase in volcanic or tectonic activity, leading to more magma reaching the surface of the Earth. In this case, the increased magma would provide more opportunities for crystal formation, which in turn would lead to the development of more minerals. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis does not have a direct effect on the process itself, it could potentially have an indirect effect by influencing the conditions that are needed for this process to occur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1959, on board a spacecraft, two aliens race to keep an experiment from being released by a third member of the crew. The seemingly possessed third alien shoots the canister into space where it crashes to Earth. Nearby, a college man takes his date to a parking spot when they see a falling star and investigate. It lands in the path of an escaped criminally insane mental patient. As his date is attacked by the axe-wielding maniac, the boy finds the canister, from which a small slug-like thing jumps out and into his mouth. Twenty-seven years later, Chris Romero pines over a love lost, supported by his disabled friend J.C. During pledge week at Corman University, Chris spots a girl, Cynthia Cronenberg, and falls instantly in love. To get her attention, he decides to join a fraternity. Cynthia's boyfriend, who heads the fraternity, tasks them with stealing a cadaver from the university medical center and depositing it on the steps of a sorority house. Chris and J.C. find a frozen corpse in a secret room, but when it grabs them, they flee. Meanwhile, Detective Ray Cameron, a haunted cop, is called in to the cryogenics lab break-in, where he discovers one of the bodies â the boy who discovered the alien experiment in 1959 â is now missing, set free by Chris and J.C. The corpse makes its way back to the sorority house where he picked up his date twenty-seven years ago. There, his head splits open and releases more of the slugs. Called to the scene, Det. Cameron finds the body, interpreting the condition of the head as the result of an axe wound in the face. The next day, the fraternity brothers confront Chris and J.C., who they believe to be responsible for the previous night's incident. They are then taken in for questioning by the police.

It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“. This is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows. Question: Who does the author feel should be accountable for their words? === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"The author feels that everyone, regardless of their status as a community member, commentator, employee, or any other position, should be accountable for their words. The author also believes that accountability does not just end with sharing one's viewpoints on a blog, but extends to engaging with readers' comments, criticisms, and perspectives in a respectful and polite manner.

Moon: The celestial body that orbits around the Earth, visible at night. In this context, it signifies the primary subject of the sentence and the source of light in the night scene being described. 2. Rising: This word refers to the motion of the moon as it appears to move upward in the sky. It helps to create a vivid picture of the moon at a specific point in time, possibly early in the night when the moon is still relatively low in the sky. 3. Lake: As the geographical feature mentioned in the sentence, the lake is significant because it provides context for the setting. It is a key element in the scene being described, and the presence of water offers a potential for reflection and added visual interest. 4. Night: This word helps to define the time the scene takes place. As the opposite of day, night offers a particular atmosphere, often associated with darkness, tranquility, and the presence of stars and other celestial bodies that are not visible during the day.

Q: Fellinger pointed us to video posts of the CVA events showing that Cruz each time took questions via a moderator , who recognized a few individuals to speak directly to Cruz . But could it be that U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz does n't get personally grilled by constituents very often ? Cruz , poised to seek re-election as Texas ' junior Republican senator in 2018 , hardly has a reputation for avoiding attention . A Concerned Veterans for America spokesman , Jim Fellinger , told us each CVA event with Cruz was open to the public by registration , without the group screening out anybody who registered .

RNA (ribonucleic acid) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, which is the process of creating proteins in cells. This statement relates to the \\"Central Dogma of Molecular Biology,\\" which describes how genetic information from DNA is used to create proteins, which are vital elements of cellular functionality and structure. To understand the synthesis of proteins via RNA, let's look at the types of RNA and their respective roles: 1. mRNA (Messenger RNA): Messenger RNA is synthesized from a DNA template through a process known as transcription. DNA stores the genetic information required for the development and the functioning of organisms; however, DNA is stationary within the cell nucleus and cannot directly contribute to protein synthesis. Therefore, regions of DNA that encode specific proteins are transcribed into complementary mRNA sequences. This mRNA then serves as a portable set of instructions, traveling out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm of the cell, where protein synthesis takes place. 2. rRNA (Ribosomal RNA): This type of RNA is a major component of the ribosomes, the cell's protein-producing factories. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis, where the decoding of mRNA into a polypeptide chain (protein) takes place. 3. tRNA (Transfer RNA): Transfer RNA acts as the link between the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins. It \\"reads\\" the genetic information from the mRNA in sets of three bases known as codons, and it secures the corresponding amino acid. tRNA then brings the amino acids to the ribosomes to aid in the construction of the protein. In summary, during protein synthesis, DNA's needed information is first transcribed into mRNA. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and is translated by the ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The ribosomes, along with tRNA, translate the genetic information in the mRNA into a string of amino acids to form a protein. This complex, multi-step procedure demonstrates how RNA is indispensable in the creation of proteins, vital molecules that carry out a wide variety of functions within organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: The answer to the question: What year was Just a Gigolo first recorded? is inside the article: According to jazz critic Gary Giddins, Misterioso is a hard bop record. The songs performed for the album were arranged by Monk, who reworked four of his earlier compositions. In the album's liner notes, Keepnews wrote of Monk's approach to arrangements: \\"It should be axiomatic that Monk is a constantly self-renewing composer-arranger-musician, that each new recording of an 'old' number, particularly with different personnel, represents a fresh view of it—almost a new composition.\\" In the producer's opinion, Monk played the piano more vividly and less introspectively than on his studio recordings in response to the enthusiastic crowds he drew nightly to the venue.On \\"Nutty\\", Griffin incorporated lines from \\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\\" and exhibited a frenetic swing that was complemented by counterplay from Haynes and Monk. \\"Blues Five Spot\\", a new composition by Monk for the album, is a twelve-bar blues homage to the Five Spot Café and featured solos from each player. Griffin and Monk transfigured chord structures and melodies throughout the performance. Griffin's solo vamp maintained the rhythm while quoting lines from other pieces, including the theme song for the animated Popeye theatrical shorts; he played \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\" at the end of \\"Blues Five Spot\\". The quartet began \\"In Walked Bud\\" with an eight-bar piano intro and thirty-two-bar form. Griffin began his solo a minute into the song with saxophone wails. In the third minute, Monk did not play, while Griffin played fast phrases at the top of his register with intermittently slower R&B and free jazz elements. Monk shouted approvingly throughout Griffin's solo before he resumed piano and played a two-minute theme. \\"Just a Gigolo\\", a standard, was the only song on the album not composed by Monk, who performed it in a brief, unaccompanied version.

It looked like a cloud with a ponytail . Odd thing . The twisting of the tip hanging down made it more obvious , though : it was a tornado ! Question What may have caused the tornado ? Answer:","completion":"The tornado may have been caused by a combination of atmospheric conditions and weather patterns. Here are the steps that might have led to its formation: 1. Warm, moist air: The presence of warm, moist air near the ground level is a critical factor in tornado development. This air is typically associated with a low-pressure system, which can promote the formation of thunderstorms. 2. Temperature gradient: A significant temperature gradient between the warm, moist air and cooler, drier air at higher altitudes must be present. This temperature difference can result in the formation of a strong updraft within the thunderstorm, which is an essential element for tornadoes to develop. 3. Wind shear: The presence of wind shear, or a difference in wind speed and direction between the ground level and higher altitudes, is another important factor in tornado formation. Wind shear can cause the updraft within the thunderstorm to rotate, creating a rotating column of air known as a mesocyclone. 4. Trigger mechanism: A specific event or condition, such as the passage of a cold front or the collision of two air masses, can act as a trigger for the tornado. This trigger can cause the rotation within the mesocyclone to tighten and intensify, eventually leading to the formation of a visible funnel cloud. 5. Touchdown: Once the funnel cloud has formed, it can continue to intensify and potentially touch down on the ground, at which point it officially becomes a tornado. The tornado can then move along the ground, picking up debris and causing damage until it eventually weakens and dissipates. In summary, the tornado the user witnessed was likely caused by a combination of warm, moist air close to the ground, a significant temperature gradient, the presence of wind shear, and a specific trigger event that caused the rotation to intensify and form a visible funnel cloud."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice, Austro-Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism, a movement which sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, thus offering a solution to the so-called Jewish Question of the European states, in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time. Does the answer correctly answer the question","completion":"Yes, the answer correctly identifies Theodor Herzl as the founder of political Zionism. Theodor Herzl was a Jewish-Austro Hungarian journalist and playwright who is most known for his pivotal role in the creation of the modern Zionist movement. Herzl's Zionism was unique in its emphasis on political strategy, as opposed to previous efforts that had largely focused on small-scale settlement and religious contemplation. Born in Budapest in 1860, Herzl became acutely conscious of the Jewish Question, an increasingly common topic of debate in Europe which questioned how to integrate the often marginalized and persecuted Jews with the rest of society. This question became intensely personal for Herzl following the Dreyfus affair in France, where Herzl was stationed as a journalist. This highly publicized event saw a Jewish military officer falsely accused of treason, highlighting the rampant antisemitism in Europe. Motivated by such events, Herzl believed that the establishment of a Jewish state would enable Jews to control their own fate, free from persecution and fully integrated into the world community as equals. He wrote these ideas down in his pamphlet \\"Der Judenstaat\\" or \\"The Jewish State\\", published in 1896. This pamphlet sparked the Zionist political movement and led to the first Zionist Congress in 1897, hosted by Herzl in Basel, Switzerland. Herzl's political Zionism not only insisted on the necessity of a Jewish state for the future security of Jewish people, but also outlined practical means to achieve this end. It involved diplomacy with world powers to obtain a charter for Jewish settlement, and proposed methods for organizing Jewish migrants and investing in the economic development of the Jewish state. This pragmatic avenue to achieve Jewish self-determination distinguished Herzl's political Zionism and offered a concrete plan to end Jewish suffering in the diaspora. Therefore, while Zionism as a concept did exist prior to Herzl’s efforts, he is recognized as the founder of political Zionism due to his emphasis on practical political means to establish a Jewish state, making a significant impact on redefining Jewish national aspirations."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Gujarati language and a corresponding English translation of the Gujarati sentence.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. a plant requires water to grow A plant would prefer","completion":"Water is essential for the growth and overall well-being of plants. It plays a critical role in many processes that occur within the plant, ensuring that it remains healthy and reaches its full potential. The reasons a plant requires water to grow can be extensively elaborated upon, as they involve various aspects of plant biology, physiology, and overall development. Water enables the uptake of nutrients, as it is the primary medium through which nutrients are absorbed by plant roots. When water is absorbed through a plant's root hairs, nutrients dissolved in the soil solution come alongside it, providing essential elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Once these nutrients are taken up by the roots, water acts as a transportation medium, allowing the movement of these essential nutrients throughout the plant via the xylem. Additionally, water plays a central role in photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy for growth and other functions. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, the small organelles found in plant cells, where water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight are combined to produce glucose, a primary source of energy for plants. In this process, oxygen molecules are released as a byproduct. Without water, the photosynthesis process comes to a halt, inhibiting the plant's ability to produce energy for growth. Transpiration, another essential function dependent on water, is a vital factor in plant growth. Transpiration is the process of water evaporating from a plant's leaves, primarily through tiny pores called stomata. This loss of water creates a driving force that draws more water up from the plant's roots, ensuring constant water and nutrient supply. As the evaporation of water occurs, it helps regulate the plant's temperature, removing excess heat and allowing the plant to maintain an optimal temperature for growth and development. Furthermore, the opening and closing of stomata, which controls transpiration rate, also play a crucial role in regulating gas exchange between the plant and its environment. Water also acts as a support system for plants by providing turgor pressure. When plant cells absorb water, they expand, exerting pressure against the cell walls, which in turn provides structure and rigidity. This turgor pressure is critical for maintaining the plant's overall structure and ensuring that stems and leaves remain firm and erect. Without adequate water, cells lose their turgor pressure, resulting in a wilting appearance and impaired structural integrity. In terms of a plant's preference for water, it's essential to consider several factors such as water quality, quantity, and frequency. 1. Water quality: Plants generally prefer water free from contaminants, such as excessive salts, chemicals, or pollutants, which could negatively impact growth or cause toxicity. In many cases, rainwater is considered the ideal water source, as it is relatively free of impurities. However, tap water and groundwater can also be suitable if they meet quality requirements. 2. Water quantity: Sufficient water must be provided to meet the plant's needs, which can vary depending on the specific plant species, stage of development, pot or root size, and environmental conditions such as light and temperature. Over or under-watering can lead to issues like root rot, nutrient deficiencies, and growth impairment. 3. Water frequency: The regularity at which a plant receives water is also crucial. Generally, plants prefer a consistent watering schedule that is neither too frequent nor too infrequent. The ideal watering frequency is dependent on the species and its specific requirements, as well as the growing conditions and environmental factors. In conclusion, plants require water for a multitude of reasons, including nutrient uptake, photosynthesis, transpiration, and structural support, among other vital functions. The preferences of a plant concerning water quality, quantity, and frequency must be carefully considered to ensure optimal growth and overall health."},{"prompt":"Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

Process: - As the sweat evaporates the sweat sheds molecules into the air - The sweat changes into a gas - Heat is drawn from the sweat - This process draws heat from the body - The evaporation also cools the remaining sweat on the body. Question: suppose a person is doing physical work happens, how will it affect more heat is drawn. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"When a person is doing physical work, more heat will be drawn from their body. This is because physical work generates heat as the body's muscles are producing energy to perform the tasks. Hence, the correct answer is A: more. To elaborate further, let's discuss the factors involved in this process and how they contribute to drawing more heat from the body. 1. Metabolism and heat generation: During physical work, the body's metabolism increases to produce more energy. As a result, this higher metabolic rate leads to increased heat generation within the body, creating a need for the body to dissipate the excess heat effectively. 2. Blood circulation: To help maintain body temperature, blood circulation increases to distribute the heat generated during physical work more evenly. Increased blood flow enhances the heat exchange between the body's core and the skin surface, facilitating heat loss. 3. Muscle activity: As muscles work harder during physical work, they generate more heat as a byproduct of their energy metabolism. This additional heat must be dissipated through the body's thermal regulatory mechanisms, which involve drawing heat away. 4. Sweating: As the body's temperature rises during physical work, sweating increases to help create a cooling effect. The evaporation of sweat draws heat away from the body, allowing the body to maintain an optimal temperature. More physical work results in greater sweat production, leading to more heat being drawn from the body. 5. Increased exposed surface area: During physical work, the body's exposed surface area may increase due to clothing adjustments or body positioning. This increased surface area allows for more effective heat loss as the evaporative cooling effect is amplified. Overall, when a person engages in physical work, various physiological processes occur that result in more heat being drawn from the body. These processes help to maintain an optimal temperature, ensuring the body can continue to function efficiently during intense physical activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A is wrong because it talks about bones, which are not what we're focusing on when we locate the grain. B is incorrect because it talks about grain percentages, which are not relevant to slicing meat. D is not right because it talks about cattle and digestive problems, which are unrelated to the process of slicing meat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

[I] yes [II] it is not possible to tell [III] no","completion":"[II] it is not possible to tell Explanation: The premise and hypothesis have similarities but there are some distinctions which make it difficult to say whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. The premise states: 1. \\"in some countries where birth control has been unavailable\\" 2. \\"almost all indigenous groups they can work with\\" 3. \\"have some abortion ties\\" This implies that the speaker is referring to certain conditions when speaking about indigenous groups and their abortion ties, specifically, the lack of birth control availability in some countries. The hypothesis, however, states: 1. \\"where contraceptives are unavailable\\" 2. \\"almost all the groups they work with\\" 3. \\"are tied to abortion\\" In the hypothesis, there is a slight change in language. It mentions \\"contraceptives\\" instead of \\"birth control.\\" While these terms are often used interchangeably, they are not exactly the same. Contraceptives are a type of birth control that specifically prevents fertilization or implantation, while birth control also includes methods that work after fertilization has occurred, such as abortion itself. Moreover, the hypothesis does not specifically mention \\"indigenous groups\\", but rather broadly refers to \\"almost all the groups they work with.\\" The premise is focused on the indigenous groups, while the hypothesis could be perceived as including other non-indigenous groups as well. Therefore, given the differences in the specific wording and focus, it is not possible to definitively say that the premise entails the hypothesis without more context or clarification on the terms and the groups being discussed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Most people thought the All Blacks would win easily because they were the favorite team and the game was being played in their country.

January 25, 1861), on February 16, 1852 in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Russell was the second of five children, of whom two survived into adulthood. His mother died when he was 9 years old. The Russells lived for a time in Philadelphia before moving to Pittsburgh, where they became members of the Presbyterian Church. With the formation of the Watch Tower Society, Russell intensified his ministry. His Bible study group had grown to hundreds of local members, with followers throughout New England, the Virginias, Ohio, and elsewhere. They annually re-elected him \\"Pastor\\", and commonly referred to him as \\"Pastor Russell\\". Congregations that eventually formed in other nations also followed this tradition. In 1881, Russell published his first work to gain wide distribution: Food for Thinking Christians. The 162-page \\"pamphlet\\" was published using donated funds amounting to approximately 40,000 (current value 1,014,345). It had a circulation of nearly 1.5 million copies over a period of four months distributed throughout the United States, Canada and Great Britain by various channels. During the same year he published Tabernacle and its Teachings which was quickly expanded and reissued as Tabernacle Shadows of the \\"Better Sacrifices\\", outlining his interpretation of the various animal sacrifices and tabernacle ceremonies instituted by Moses. Russell claimed that the distribution of these works and other tracts by the Watch Tower Society during 1881 exceeded by eight times that of the American Tract Society for the year 1880. In 1903, newspapers began publishing his written sermons. These newspaper sermons were syndicated worldwide in as many as 4,000 newspapers, eventually reaching an estimated readership of some 15 million in the United States and Canada. In 1910 the secular journal Overland Monthly calculated that by 1909, Russell's writings had become the most widely distributed, privately produced English-language works in the United States. It said that the entire corpus of his works were the third most circulated on earth, after the Bible and the Chinese Almanac. In 1912 The Continent, a Presbyterian journal, stated that in North America Russell's writings had achieved a greater circulation \\"than the combined circulation of the writings of all the priests and preachers in North America.\\" Russell also had many critics, and he was frequently described as a heretic in this period. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What else did he publish?","completion":"Charles Taze Russell published many things, but a few examples are a book called \\"Food for Thinking Christians\\" and another one called \\"Tabernacle and its Teachings\\" which was later expanded and reissued as \\"Tabernacle Shadows of the 'Better Sacrifices'\\".

Using evidence from the passage, it can be inferred that Dean has strong feelings about the situations involving Sam, Evan, and their respective loved ones. When the passage mentions \\"how desperate [Evan] was about his wife's impending death and that he [has] (and still would) do anything to prevent it,\\" it demonstrates that Evan's actions are driven by a deep emotional attachment to his wife. Furthermore, Dean's point about how Evan's wife would feel provides insight into his understanding of the consequences of desperate actions. The passage also discusses Sam's death and Dean's deal, which brings attention to the connections between these two characters. The fact that Dean's ticket comes due after Sam dies suggests that Dean is likely to feel the weight of the loss. Although it does not explicitly state Dean's emotional state, the passage hints at the emotional consequences of these events. Considering that the passage focuses on a conversation about desperate decisions made for those they love, and the close relationship between Sam and Dean, it is reasonable to assume that after Dean leaves, he will mourn Sam's death as option (d) suggests. The passage may also imply that Dean could perceive the futility of any deals to save Sam, drawing a parallel to Evan's situation with his wife."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: Where would George and Helene go to leave messages for each other?, using the article: A common convention in the early decades of newspaper and magazine film reviews was to describe in the write-up the entire storyline including, in a substantial number of instances, the ending, thus unintentionally enabling subsequent generations of readers to reconstruct a lost film's contents.

He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing, and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower, then a journalist at the Agriculture Department, he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe. He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928. After a one-year assignment in France, Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Mosely, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to February 1933. Major Dwight D.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked. Of course no one else was interested in spending an entire night shooting the film – but with them as stands in – just so I could complete my psychotic endeavour of...

Dozens of chemicals in tobacco smoke, including nicotine, have been shown to cause cancer ( Figure below ). In fact, tobacco smoke is one of the main sources of chemical carcinogens. Smoking tobacco increases the risk of cancer of the lung, mouth, throat, and bladder. Using smokeless tobacco can also cause cancer. Other chemicals that cause cancer include asbestos, formaldehyde, benzene, cadmium, and nickel.

Please answer the following question: This article: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. He has featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows. He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed \\"Mr... contains an answer for the question: What is the better-known name of the person who sang lead vocals on \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\"?, what is it ?

This is a correct answer to the following question about Standard deviation. Yes or no? Answer: In science, researchers commonly report the standard deviation of experimental data, and only effects that fall far outside the range of standard deviation are considered statistically significant – normal random error or variation in the measurements is in this way distinguished from causal variation. Question: what is standard deviation in statistics Answer:","completion":"Yes, the given answer is a correct explanation for the standard deviation in the context of scientific research. To make it more comprehensive, let me further explain what standard deviation is in general. Standard deviation in statistics is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. It indicates the average distance of individual data points from the mean of the data set. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out. It helps us understand how data is distributed around the mean, and it is commonly used in various fields, including science and finance. In scientific research, as mentioned in the answer, standard deviation helps researchers differentiate normal random error or variation in measurements from causal variation, which is crucial for determining the statistical significance of results. By considering effects far outside the range of standard deviation, researchers can minimize the chances of attributing a result to random error or chance rather than an actual cause."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920.

Make sweeping a game for kids. pick from the following. 1. Put clear tape around a tile for kids to collect dust towards. 2. Put colored tape around a tile for kids to collect dust towards.","completion":"To make sweeping a game for kids, you can use the colored tape method. Below is a detailed and step-by-step approach to turn the mundane task of sweeping into a fun activity for kids: 1. Choose the area: Identify an area in your home, preferably a floor with tiles, where dust and dirt tend to accumulate quickly. This could be the living room, the hallway, or the kitchen, depending on your home's layout. The area must also be safe and convenient for kids to move around without any potential hazards. 2. Gather materials: The materials you need to make this game are easily accessible and inexpensive. These include: a. A broom or child-sized broom suitable for kids' use b. A dustpan c. Different-colored adhesive tapes (make sure they are easy to remove from the floor) 3. Preparing the colored tape shapes: Cut several pieces of each colored tape and create different shapes (such as squares, circles, or triangles) with each color. The shapes should be large enough to collect dust towards them, approximately 8-10 inches in size. 4. Arrange the shapes: Stick the colored shapes on the floor tiles, forming a random pattern. Ensure there are enough shapes spread across the sweeping area to make it interesting and achievable for kids. 5. Explain the game: Gather the kids and introduce them to the game. Explain the rules and assign a point system; for example, for each shape that gets completely filled with dust, the child can earn a point. You could also assign different points based on the colors or difficulty levels of the shapes available. Encourage teamwork or friendly competition. 6. Start the game: Distribute the brooms and dustpans among the kids. Let them start sweeping the dust, dirt, or other debris towards the colored tape shapes. Encourage them to fill each shape fully to earn the most points. Ensure you are present to supervise and guide them as they play. 7. Praise and reward: As the children fill up the shapes, praise their efforts and record their points. Keep the atmosphere positive and encouraging. Once they've completed the game, help them count their points and reward them with small treats or experiences, such as an extra 30 minutes of playtime, a special dessert, or a small toy. 8. Clean up: After the game is over, help the kids learn the importance of cleaning up by involving them in picking up dust using the dustpan and disposing of it in the trash bin. Also, remove the colored tape shapes from the floor. Making sweeping into a game engages children in a fun way and teaches them the value of cleanliness and teamwork. The colored tape method motivates kids to sweep by giving them visual targets to aim for, allowing them to see their progress and creating a sense of achievement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Only about 4,000 to 6,000 Western tourists visit North Korea each year. All tourism is organized by one of several state-owned tourism bureaus, including Korea International Travel Company (KITC), Korean International Sports Travel Company (KISTC), Korean International Taekwondo Tourism Company (KITTC) and Korean International Youth Travel Company (KIYTC). Is the following statement correct based on the text can you travel to north korea as a tourist","completion":"Yes, the statement is correct based on the text. You can travel to North Korea as a tourist. However, tourism in North Korea is tightly controlled by the North Korean government, and only a limited number of Western tourists are allowed to visit each year. Furthermore, all tourism-related activities must be organized through one of the several state-owned tourism bureaus, such as Korea International Travel Company (KITC), Korean International Sports Travel Company (KISTC), Korean International Taekwondo Tourism Company (KITTC), or Korean International Youth Travel Company (KIYTC). Traveling to North Korea as a tourist involves a highly regulated and structured process. Tourists are generally required to be part of guided group tours led by North Korean guides who monitor and control the group's movements throughout the country. Independent travel is not permitted, and tourists have limited interaction with local North Koreans. The itineraries and sightseeing destinations are usually predetermined and strictly controlled by the authorities to showcase the best aspects of the country and maintain a positive image. There are some restrictions on who can visit North Korea as a tourist. For instance, tourists from South Korea are not allowed to enter the country, and US citizens may face additional complications due to travel restrictions imposed by the US government. Despite the strict controls and limitations, tourists who visit North Korea can get a unique glimpse into an isolated and enigmatic country. Popular tourist attractions include the capital city of Pyongyang, the demilitarized zone (DMZ) at the border with South Korea, the ancient city of Kaesong, and Mount Paektu, a significant cultural symbol in both North and South Korea. In conclusion, while it is possible to visit North Korea as a tourist, one must be aware of the strict regulations and controlled environment in the country. Tourism is allowed, but it is limited and organized through state-owned tourism bureaus to ensure compliance with North Korean government policies and guidelines."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – Generally speaking, sociologists find that people in relationships tend to be happier and more satisfied than single people. But a new study makes clear that for some, being single is the way to be. It all depends on how individuals deal with conflict in relationships—those who hate it and try to avoid it at all costs report being just as happy when they're single as people in committed relationships, the New Zealand researchers write at EurekaAlert. In researcher-speak, such people have high \\"avoidance social goals,\\" and when they're in relationships, they often end up being miserable. “It’s a well-documented finding that single people tend to be less happy compared to those in a relationship, but that may not be true for everyone,” says lead researcher Yuthika Girme of the University of Auckland. Her survey involved more than 4,000 people age 18 to 94. The results show that \\"you can never say one size fits all,\\" a George Mason professor not involved with the study tells HealthDay. But before singles start exulting in I-told-you-sos, he adds that people who can't deal with conflict tend to be a little neurotic and might benefit from counseling. Such studies are important as the number of single people rises, notes Discovery, which says 51% of adult Americans fall in the bucket. It cites previous research showing that people who have a strong fear of being alone often end up in lousy relationships, too. \\"Taken together, these studies suggest that not everyone is cut out for relationships,\\" writes Talal al-Khatib. \\"The single life isn’t so bad after all.\\" (Another study finds that for those with depression, having happy friends helps.)","completion":"Title: Single Life vs. Committed Relationships: Happiness Depends on Conflict Management Introduction: Conventional wisdom suggests that people who are in committed relationships are generally happier than those who are single. However, a recent study from New Zealand indicates that this may not always be the case, and individual happiness might depend on how one deals with conflict in relationships. People who hate conflict and avoid it at all costs are found to be just as happy when they're single as those in committed relationships. Main Body: Researchers from the University of Auckland conducted a study involving over 4,000 individuals aged between 18 and 94. The new study aimed at understanding happiness in relationships based on how people deal with conflicts. The researchers classified people with high \\"avoidance social goals\\" as individuals who dislike and try to avoid conflicts in relationships. Yuthika Girme, the lead researcher, noted that despite the well-documented finding that single people are generally less happy than those in relationships, it may not be true for everyone. According to the study, people with high avoidance social goals are found to be just as happy when they are single as those who are in committed relationships. This observation suggests that the conventional idea of a one-size-fits-all approach to happiness derived from relationships is flawed. A professor from George Mason University, who wasn’t involved in the study, commented on the findings, stating that people who cannot deal with conflict tend to be neurotic and might benefit from counseling. It is essential to note that as the number of single people is on the rise, with 51% of adult Americans being single, such research becomes crucial in understanding the factors affecting happiness and relationship satisfaction. Additionally, previous studies have shown that people with a strong fear of being alone often end up in subpar relationships. When combined with the current research, these findings suggest that not everyone might be suitable for relationships, and being single does not necessarily lead to unhappiness. Conclusion: In conclusion, the study from New Zealand demonstrates that individual happiness in regard to relationships is significantly influenced by how people handle conflicts. For those who avoid conflict at all costs, being single can be just as satisfying as being in a committed relationship. This research underscores the importance of not generalizing happiness and relationship satisfaction and considering individual differences when assessing the quality of relationships. Ultimately, the single life might not be as detrimental to one's happiness as previously thought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Information: - A general election was held in the Northern Territory on Saturday June 7 , 1980 . It was the first to be held since self - government was attained two years earlier , and was won by the incumbent Country Liberal Party ( CLP ) under Chief Minister Paul Everingham . Although the CLP 's share of the vote increased by almost 10 percentage points , it lost one seat . The only independent member of the Legislative Assembly , Dawn Lawrie , retained her seat of Nightcliff . - Paul Anthony Edward Everingham AO (born 4 February 1943) was the head of government of the Northern Territory from 1977 to 1984, serving as the second and last Majority Leader (19771978) and the first Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1978 to 1984. - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country. - The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is the head of government of the Northern Territory. The office is the equivalent of a State Premier. When the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly was created in 1974, the head of government was officially known as Majority Leader. This title was used in the first parliament (19741977) and the first eighteen months of the second. When self-government was granted the Northern Territory in 1978, the title of the head of government became Chief Minister. What is the relationship between 'northern territory general election' and 'chief minister of the northern territory'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between the 'Northern Territory general election' and the 'Chief Minister of the Northern Territory' lies in the fact that the general election determines who will be the head of the government of the Northern Territory, which is the Chief Minister. The Northern Territory general election is a democratic process whereby eligible voters in the Northern Territory cast their votes to choose members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) are elected to represent the constituents of their respective electorates. The political party or coalition that wins the majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly forms the government, and the leader of that party becomes the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. In the context of the information provided, the general election held on June 7, 1980, was significant as it was the first to be held since self-government was achieved two years prior. The incumbent Country Liberal Party (CLP) won the election under the leadership of Chief Minister Paul Everingham, who served as the second and last Majority Leader and then became the first Chief Minister of the Northern Territory when self-government was granted. Therefore, the Northern Territory general election and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory are related as the election serves as a mechanism for the citizens of the territory to select their representatives in the Legislative Assembly and, subsequently, determine the head of government—the Chief Minister—who leads the territory and makes crucial decisions on behalf of its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Passage 1:Rafael \\"Rafi\\" Eitan (; 23 November 1926 – 23 March 2019) was an Israeli politician and intelligence officer. He also led Gil and served as Minister of Senior Citizens. He was in charge of the Mossad operation that led to the arrest of Adolf Eichmann. He served as an advisor on terrorism to Prime Minister Menachem Begin, and in 1981 he was appointed to head the Bureau of Scientific Relations, then an intelligence entity on par with Mossad, Aman and Shabak. Eitan assumed responsibility for and resigned over the Jonathan Pollard affair, and the Bureau was disbanded. He was subject to an arrest warrant issued by the United States FBI. From 1985 until 1993, he was head of the government's Chemicals company, which was expanded under his leadership. After 1993, he became a businessman, noted for several large scale agricultural and construction ventures in Cuba. He was the chairman of the Vetek (Seniority) Association – the Senior Citizens Movement. Passage 2:In January 1996 former National Geographic photographer Charles O'Rear was on his way from his home in St. Helena, California, in the Napa Valley north of San Francisco, to visit his girlfriend, Daphne Irwin (whom he later married), in the city, as he did every Friday afternoon. He was working with Irwin on a book about the wine country. He was particularly alert for a photo opportunity that day, since a storm had just passed over and other recent winter rains had left the area especially green. Driving along the Sonoma Highway (California State Route 12 and 121) he saw the hill, free of the vineyards that normally covered the area; they had been pulled out a few years earlier following a phylloxera infestation. \\"There it was! My God, the grass is perfect! It's green! The sun is out; there's some clouds,\\" he remembered thinking. He stopped somewhere near the Napa–Sonoma county line and pulled off the road to set his Mamiya RZ67 medium-format camera on a tripod, choosing Fujifilm's Velvia, a film often used among nature photographers and known to saturate some colors. O'Rear credits that combination of camera and film for the success of the image. \\"It made the difference and, I think, helped the 'Bliss' photograph stand out even more,\\" he said. \\"I think that if I had shot it with 35 mm, it would not have nearly the same effect.\\" While he was setting up his camera, he said it was possible that the clouds in the picture came in. \\"Everything was changing so quickly at that time.\\" He took four shots and got back into his truck. According to O'Rear, the image was not digitally enhanced or manipulated in any way. Passage 3:In 1998, one week after winning E3 Harelbeke and the Brabantse Pijl in the same weekend, he won the Tour of Flanders, thereby equaling the race's record of three wins. One week later, Museeuw made a horrific fall in Paris–Roubaix on the Trouée d'Arenberg cobbled sector, leaving his kneeknap shattered. On top came a dangerous gangrene infection which nearly forced doctors to amputate his left leg. He fought back and resumed cycling after a long healing process, finishing third in the Tour of Flanders of 1999 and ninth in Paris–Roubaix, exactly one year after his horror crash. In 2000 he won Paris–Roubaix a second time after a 44 km solo. Upon crossing the finish line in victory, he lifted his left leg, pointing to his knee as a reminder of the injury that had almost ended his career two years before. Later that year, he was again injured in a motor cycle accident, causing a severe head trauma and several days in a coma. His dogged determination and powerful riding style won him legions of fans all over the world and made him all the more popular in his native Flanders.

Big continent got a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which continent used more chlorine gasses? Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, the Big continent used more air polluting substances, including chlorine gases. This conclusion can be derived from the fact that the Big continent experienced a hole in its ozone layer as a consequence of their actions. The hint mentions that chlorine and bromine gases are chief culprits in the destruction of the ozone layer, which is being destroyed by air pollution. The ozone hole has been associated with an increase in UV radiation reaching the Earth, resulting in adverse effects on humans, marine life, and the environment as a whole. Given that the Small continent was very protective towards the environment and did not experience the negative consequences faced by the Big continent, it can be inferred that the Small continent used fewer air polluting substances, including chlorine gases. Therefore, it is evident that the Big continent used more chlorine gases, which contributed to the destruction of the ozone layer and the subsequent formation of a hole in the ozone layer over the continent. This harmful activity highlights the necessity for the consistent implementation of restrictions on pollutants to mitigate further damage to the ozone layer and preserve the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor. and Daniel Martin. David Cameron today vowed to 'challenge the extremist narrative' of some Islamic organisations as he ordered an investigation into the Muslim Brotherhood to check whether it is planning attacks in the Middle East from Britain. The Prime Minister said he wanted to establish a 'complete picture' of the group's 'philosophy and activities', with information being gathered by both MI5 and MI6. The review was prompted by evidence received by the Government that Brotherhood leaders met in London last year to plot their response to events in Egypt. Prime Minister David Cameron addressed reporters at a press conference alongside Italian PM Matteo Renzi. Speaking at a No 10 news conference, Mr Cameron said that the Government was committed to encouraging people away from the path of extremism. 'We want to challenge the extremist narrative that some Islamist organisations have put out,' he told reporters following talks with new Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi. 'What I think is important about the Muslim Brotherhood is that we understand what this organisation is, what it stands for, what its beliefs are in terms of the path of extremism and violent extremism, what its connections are with other groups, what its presence is here in the United Kingdom. Our policies should be informed by a complete picture of that knowledge,' he said. 'It is an important piece of work because because we will only get our policy right if we fully understand the true nature of the organisation that we are dealing with.' Handshake: David Cameron, pictured with Mohammed Morsi - the Brotherhood chief who was elected president of Egypt then deposed last year. It was reported last night that the probe will include assessments from MI6, the foreign intelligence service, into whether the body was behind a spate of recent attacks in Egypt. The domestic intelligence service, MI5, will be asked to look into how many senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood are based in the UK. The inquiry will also look into claims that leaders of the organisation met in London late last year to decide its strategy. There are concerns that the capital is being used as a hub for its extremist activities. Mohammed Morsi, the Brotherhood chief who was elected president of Egypt then deposed last year, is in jail. Following the army-led coup in Egypt, some Brotherhood leaders are reported to have fled to London, and may be co-ordinating their next move from a flat in the north-west suburb of Cricklewood. The Prime Minister is understood to have come under pressure from Egypt and Saudi Arabia to ban the group, but this is unlikely to happen. Last night a spokesman for No 10 said: ‘The Prime Minister has commissioned an internal government review into the philosophy and activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Government’s policy towards the organisation.’ Unrest: Clashes have taken place in Cairo between riot police and those who support the Muslim Brotherhood and ousted President Mohamed Mursi. As part of the review MI6 will look into allegations the group was responsible for the murder of three tourists on a bus in Egypt in February and a series of other recent attacks. The Brotherhood is Egypt’s oldest and largest Islamist organisation and has inspired similar movements around the world with its political activism and charity work. Officials have said it is ‘possible but unlikely’ that the organisation will join the list of groups proscribed because of their links to terrorism. Last month 529 Brotherhood members were sentenced to death by a court in Cairo, as part of a crackdown on the group. Mr Cameron asked Sir John Jenkins, Britain’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, to report on the Brotherhood’s ‘philosophy and values and alleged connections with extremism and violence’ by the end of July. Sir Kim Darroch, the National Security Adviser, has already started work on the report. Egyptian relatives of supporters of ousted Islamist president Mohamed Morsi cry sitting outside the courthouse in the southern province of Minya after 529 Brotherhood members were sentenced to death. Protests: The ruling is an escalation of Egypt's crackdown on supporters of Morsi, who was removed in July. Officials from the Senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office have previously resisted attempts to ban the organisation, arguing that to hinder a body that was largely moderate would only strengthen support of extreme Islamists. The Muslim Brotherhood is Egypt's oldest and most established Islamist group, founded at a time when they wanted to rid the country of British influence. After success members began getting involved in the country's politics but its supporters have been forced underground for most of its. existence since its birth in 1928. The coup to remove Morse last year was, in their view, the latest in a. long line of attempts to eradicate political Islam. They have been further marginalised after the interim Egyptian government declared them a terrorist group and blamed them for a series of deadly attacks in the country. Thousands of members have been arrested, hundreds sentenced to death and the organisations headquarters trashed and burned to the ground. Members have fled - including to Britain. A spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood said that it would co-operate with the Downing Street review. ‘It is a religious obligation for any Muslim Brotherhood member who lives whether in his homeland or any state to respect its system and laws,’ he told The Times. Kwasi Kwarteng, a Tory MP and member of the Conservative Middle East Council , said that the West had been blindsided by the group’s sudden emergence. ‘I saw how they won elections in Egypt and essentially they ran Egypt very much in a partisan manner. They are quite loose, so they will say different things at different people at different times to seem moderate. They are great masters of disguise. ‘I think people in the West can get very deluded about the nature of the Brotherhood. Certainly three years ago we thought they were going to be just another political party.’ London became known as Londonistan ten years ago due to the number of Islamic hate preachers in the capital.

Witte was dispatched to make peace, negotiating the Treaty of Portsmouth . In 1905, there were naval mutinies at Sevastopol , Vladivostok, and Kronstadt, peaking in June with the mutiny aboard the battleship Potemkin. The mutineers eventually surrendered the battleship to Romanian authorities on 8 July in exchange for asylum, then the Romanians returned her to Imperial Russian authorities on the following day. Some sources claim over 2,000 sailors died in the suppression. The mutinies were disorganised and quickly crushed.

The film was a co-production between companies from the United Kingdom and Germany. Can we draw the following conclusion? Kevin Macdonald directed The Last King of Scotland in the United Kingdom.","completion":"While it is accurate to say that Kevin Macdonald directed The Last King of Scotland, it is not entirely precise to conclude that he directed the film solely in the United Kingdom. The film, co-produced between British and German companies, tells the story of Ugandan dictator Idi Amin and intertwines both historical and fictional events. The film's narrative is based on the accounts of a fictional Scottish doctor, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, who served as Amin's personal physician. It is set primarily in Uganda, rather than in the UK. Considering the setting and plot, several filming locations were utilized during the production of the movie. It is crucial to note that many scenes were shot on location in Uganda and several other locations. The film used various spots in Uganda, including Entebbe Airport, State House in Entebbe, Mbarara (Western Uganda), Gulu, and Kampala. Apart from Uganda, the crew filmed in some parts of Southern Sudan and the United Kingdom, particularly in Scotland. Macdonald's efforts to immerse the film in the Ugandan environment for authenticity contributed significantly to the movie's critical success. As a result, the film received numerous awards and nominations, including winning the Academy Award for Best Actor for Forest Whitaker's portrayal of Idi Amin. In conclusion, we can definitively say that Kevin Macdonald directed The Last King of Scotland, though it is not entirely accurate to state that he directed the film just in the United Kingdom. The movie's filming took place across multiple locations, including Uganda, Southern Sudan, and Scotland, in an effort to create a more authentic representation of the historical events and the lives of the characters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Despite Helen's misgivings, the Kents settle in their rooms for the night. Helen is awakened by a noise. Alan goes to investigate. Before he learns anything, he is stabbed by Klove.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Leonard Tresilian wanted to leave his estate to? , can you please find it? The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe, and the area became known as Gillrolfes, \\"Gill\\" being Old English for glen. Following Rolfe's death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called \\"Great Gilwell\\" and \\"Little Gilwell\\". The two areas were named after the Old English \\"wella\\", or spring. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since. Around this time, an adjoining 5.6 hectares (14 acres) property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence. Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many in percent from the census weren't Pacific islander?","completion":"Title: Understanding the Percentage of People Who Were Not Pacific Islander in the Census Hello little friends! Today, we are going to talk about Census and Pacific Islanders. First, let's learn what a \\"census\\" is. A census is like a big count of all the people who live in a place, like a city or a country. It helps the people in charge to make sure that everyone's needs are met and that there are enough things like schools, parks, hospitals and buses for everyone. Now let's see who are \\"Pacific Islanders.\\" They are people who originally come from the small islands in the big ocean called the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean has lots of beautiful islands with people who have their own language, culture, and traditions. So, our main question is: in the census, how many people in percent were not Pacific Islanders? To answer this question, we need to look at the numbers we have. Imagine you have a big cake with 100 slices, and each slice represents one percent. If we find out how many slices have Pacific Islanders, we can find out how many slices are left for people who are not Pacific Islanders. Now, let's say in the census, there were 2 slices with Pacific Islanders. So, out of 100 slices, if 2 slices are with Pacific Islanders, how many are left for people who are not Pacific Islanders? To find out, we can count all the other slices: 3, 4, 5... all the way to 100. When we count them all, we find out that there are 98 slices left for people who are not Pacific Islanders. So, in this example, 98% of the people in the census were not Pacific Islanders. That's it, little friends! Just remember that in different places and different times, these numbers may change.

Summarize this article: When you're dressing out an elk, you've got to decide whether or not you want to take the bones with you. If you do, it helps to be close to camp, to make the moving process a lot easier. To start the process, you need to get the meat cooling down as quickly as possible by opening up the cavity and removing the internal organs. Elk are extremely heavy animals, making it difficult to drag a whole carcass back to camp, if you're in the back country. For this reason, it's common to just harvest the meat, leaving the bones and the guts in the field. This method is discussed in the following section. Start just below the sternum, where the layer of hide and muscle gives you the most space from the guts. Use one hand to pinch the hide and pull it up and away from the ribs, using your other hand to make a small incision with the knife just under the sternum. Make the cut shallow, but make sure it's deep enough to get through the hide and into the membrane below, which attaches to the tissue below. Listen for a whoosh of air or a hissing sound, which is a sign that you've punctured the stomach. If you have, this means you need to work very quickly to get the cavity open and get the stomach out of there, to avoid tainting the meat. It'll be fine as long as you work quickly and carefully, and rinse it off when you're finished. Elk hide is thick, and the muscle is thicker. Below that, you’re still not all the way to the organs, but the final layer separating them from your knife–and from spoiled meat–is a thin membrane, which you can feel for with your fingers. Pull upward, to separate the membrane, muscle, and hide from the organs and give your knife enough clearance to work. When you've got your fingers between the membrane and the muscle, you can pull the hide up and away, insert your knife, and work it down safely, knowing that you won't be cutting through into the guts. Be very careful of your fingers, working slowly and smoothly. Continue making your incision straight down the belly until you get just above the anus. You should stop when you can feel your knife touching the pelvis arch, the bone near the hips of the animal. If you've got a bull elk, cut around the penis, just deep enough to separate it from the skin. Do not cut the urethra that leads to the bladder or pull it loose. Instead, cut it free and let it hang. This and the bladder will all come out together later with the rest of the guts. You don’t need to worry about puncturing anything in the upper-half of the animal. The best tool for this job is a combination hunting saw and knife, like a Gerber E-Z saw. These are small, portable, and lightweight, making them ideal for backcountry work. Use the toothed edge to work in between the seam, where the ribs connect and close the chest cavity, then pull the ribcage apart to open up the interior and work. When you get to the top, it's also a good idea to go ahead and separate the wind-pipe at the neck. You can be sure that everything is separated on the inside and you can just start pulling things loose and discarding them (or saving what you want). There's no big secret to gutting the animal at this point–just start pulling the \\"train\\" loose and making small cuts along the abdominal walls to separate them, where they're attached, if necessary. Everything, for the most part, should come out in one big clump, which you can start piling between the animal's back legs as you work, being careful not to puncture anything. Don't cut through the intestines to separate them. The intestinal tract of the animal will probably still contain feces, which will spoil your meat. Pile the innards between the hind legs of the animal and move to the next step to separate them safely. Special care needs to be taken to avoid accidentally puncturing the intestines or the bladder, which will expose the meat to waste and spoilage. To do this, you'll need to split the pelvic arch and expose them more readily. Use the hacksaw or a hatchet to remove a chunk from the top of the pelvic bone and open up space to work the intestines free safely. Insert your thumb into the anus and use the knife to cut around your thumb. You can use a zip-tie to secure it and keep any waste from coming out, then pull the intestines up and free from the inside of the carcass. A plastic plug called a \\"Butt Out\\" is also available to do this, if you're uncomfortable playing elk proctologist.. If you've left the penis intact, the bladder should now come loose easily, along with everything else. Be very careful not to let it split or pop as you're working. Handle it gently and you should be fine. The cavity will likely be fairly damp and bloody, but it should be starting to cool down efficiently at this point. Some hunters like to turn the carcass over to allow it to drain some, promoting drying and cooling more effectively. If it's possible, you can hang the carcass and rinse it out with clean water if you're close enough to camp to have some to spare. Elk are extremely heavy. Even if you’re very close to camp, it’s usually best to break it down some, separating the hindquarters from the torso, just under the ribs, making it easier to pack out. Alternatively, you can also separate the meat and leave the bones in the field. It won't take long.

In the first sentence, \\"unravel\\" means to cause the thread or fabric of the tablecloth to come undone or fall apart, especially at the seam.

In the second sentence, \\"unravel\\" is used in the context of untangling the ball of wool. The cat played with the wool, causing it to become tangled and knotted, making it difficult for the mother to untangle. Again, the meaning is related to the manipulation and potential damage of the material. While the specific actions leading to the unraveling are different in each sentence, the core meaning remains the same: the process of undoing, loosening, or causing the threads of a material to come apart or become tangled.

Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains.

If you are going to date this girl, make sure that she is someone with whom you actually want to spend a lot of time. It is easy to build up unrealistic fantasies in your head, but it isn't always easy to gauge whether you would truly be happy with someone. Try talking about what motivates her; by doing so, you will create a bond between you two. Ask her and some of your other friends if they would like to go somewhere such as the mall or movies. Eventually if you two are comfortable with each other you could ask her to hang out at your house with a group of people. A group of people will make it seem less awkward.

Select the topic that this about: Confidence among Japans big manufacturers deteriorated for the first time in seven quarters, although their capital spending plans were revised higher, the Bank of Japans tankan survey for December showed on Wednesday.","completion":"Title: Deterioration in Confidence among Japan's Big Manufacturers and its Impact on Capital Spending Plans Introduction: The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) tankan survey for December revealed a decline in confidence among big manufacturers in the country for the first time in seven quarters. The survey is considered a key economic indicator and provides insights into the sentiments of Japanese businesses, which can serve as a precursor for their decisions on investment and human resources. Despite the drop in confidence, the survey also showed an upward revision in capital spending plans by these manufacturers. This analysis will focus on the reasons behind the deterioration in confidence, its potential impact on the Japanese economy, and the factors contributing to the adjustment in capital spending plans. Reasons Behind the Deterioration in Confidence: 1. Global supply chain disruptions: The ongoing pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the global supply chain, affecting various industries, including automotive, semiconductors, and electronics. Japan is known for its manufacturing prowess, and the disruptions have made the procurement of raw materials and components challenging and costly, leading to a decline in confidence among big manufacturers. 2. Labor shortage: Japan has been facing a labor shortage due to its aging population and strict immigration policies. The pandemic has exacerbated this problem as companies struggle to hire skilled workers in a tight labor market. 3. Domestic energy crisis: Japan depends heavily on imports of energy resources, primarily oil and natural gas. The recent global energy crisis and increasing energy prices have raised concerns among manufacturers related to increased production costs, subsequently affecting their confidence. Impact on the Japanese Economy: The decline in confidence among Japan's big manufacturers may have several effects on the country's economy: 1. Lower economic growth: Lower confidence often translates into reduced spending by businesses, which in turn may result in slower economic growth. This decline in spending could also lead to reduced employment opportunities. 2. Increased vulnerability to external shocks: A weakened manufacturing sector may make the Japanese economy more susceptible to external economic threats, such as a slowdown in global demand or potential disruptions in trade relations with other countries. 3. Weaker consumer confidence: The manufacturing industry is a key sector in Japan's economy, and its weakness can negatively affect consumer confidence. If consumer confidence declines, it can result in reduced consumer spending, further affecting overall economic growth. Increased Capital Spending Plans among Big Manufacturers: Despite the decline in confidence, capital spending plans by big Japanese manufacturers have been revised upwards. This can be attributed to several factors: 1. Strategic investments: Manufacturers may be investing in cost reduction measures or technological advancements to address challenges such as global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and rising energy costs. 2. Government incentives: The Japanese government has implemented several policies, such as tax breaks and subsidies, to encourage domestic manufacturers to invest in expanding production capacity and modernizing facilities, thereby boosting capital spending plans. 3. Preparing for future growth: Manufacturers may anticipate an improvement in the global economic situation, and as a preemptive measure, they choose to invest in expanding output capacity to take advantage of future growth opportunities. Conclusion: The deterioration in confidence among big manufacturers in Japan, as indicated by the recent BOJ tankan survey, highlights the challenges faced by the manufacturing sector during these uncertain times. Nevertheless, the upward revision in capital spending plans may signal continued investment in tackling these challenges and an optimistic outlook for future growth opportunities. Policymakers and businesses alike should pay close attention to these key indicators to ensure a quick and sustainable recovery for the Japanese economy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, much of the continent is more than 3,000 m (9,800 ft) above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the troposphere. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at aphelion in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at perihelion in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact. Now answer this question: How does the Arctic Ocean warm the Arctic?","completion":"The Arctic Ocean warms the Arctic region through heat transfer mechanisms. Although it may seem counter-intuitive to think of the Arctic Ocean as being \\"warm,\\" especially considering its location at the North Pole, it is important to understand that it is often warmer than the atmospheric temperature above it particularly during the winter months. This relative warmth is linked to the specific heat capacity of water, which is high compared to most other substances, and thus water can store and transfer a large amount of thermal energy. This energy transmission occurs in the form of conduction, convection, and radiation. Let's discuss each process briefly. Conduction: When the ice layer atop the Arctic Ocean is in direct contact with the warmer ocean water beneath, heat is transferred from the warmer body, the ocean, to the colder one, the ice. This process, in which heat is transmitted through a solid or liquid by the direct contact of particles is known as conduction. This heat transfer through the ice diminishes the potential for extremely low temperatures in the Arctic regions. Convection: The ocean itself is also warmed by convection currents present within it. Warm water from equatorial regions travels towards the poles, releasing heat as it does so. Conversely, cold water from the polar regions travels towards the equator, absorbing heat along the way. This constant movement and heat exchange help to spread warmth even to the colder polar region. Radiation: Lastly, when the ocean waters absorb solar heat during the summer months, due to lower albedo compared to ice, this heat is then slowly released back into the environment during the colder months, a phenomenon known as the \\"oceanic heat flux\\". This prevents the atmospheric temperature from falling to the extreme lows that are experienced in Antarctica. Keep in mind that the contribution of the Arctic Ocean's warmth is not large enough to make the Arctic a balmy region, but it diminishes the extremes of cold that might otherwise be experienced. This heat transfer mechanism is one key difference between the Arctic and Antarctica. Antarctica's lack of a comparable ocean-based heating system contributes to its much colder temperatures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: (CNN)Whitney Houston's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown was placed in a medically induced coma Saturday after being found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub full of water, a source close to the family has told CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. Brown, 21, \\"was not breathing\\" when a man identified as her husband and a friend found her at about 10:25 a.m. inside her townhouse in Roswell, Georgia, said police in the Atlanta suburb. They called 911 and performed CPR until public safety officers arrived and took over, said police spokeswoman Lisa Holland. Brown was taken to North Fulton Hospital, where \\"she is still alive and breathing. Other than that, I don't know her condition,\\" Holland said Saturday afternoon at a press briefing. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. Police had been to the residence recently. Somebody reported a fight there January 23, but nobody answered the door and officers found no evidence of an altercation, Holland told CNN. The police spokeswoman noted one oddity in the case: \\"Her mother died in the very same manner.\\" It was three years ago February 11 that Brown's mother, renowned singer Whitney Houston, was found dead -- in a bathtub -- in The Beverly Hilton, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammys bash there. An autopsy later revealed that she'd drowned facedown in \\"extremely hot water\\" about 12 inches deep. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled it an accidental drowning with the \\"effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use\\" being contributing factors. Brown is her only child. \\"She encourages me and inspires me,\\" Houston once said of her daughter. \\"When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'Okay. I can do this. I can do this.'\\" Brown was born in 1993 during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became a public figure during the mid-2000s reality show \\"Being Bobby Brown,\\" in which she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Mother and daughter even performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" in Central Park on ABC's \\"Good Morning America.\\" Given the pair's close relationship, it's no surprise that Houston's death was a major blow. Days after her mother's body was found, a grieving Bobbi Kristina -- then 18 -- was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center because she was \\"overwhelmed,\\" family friend Kim Burrell said. \\"She loves hard,\\" Burrell said then of Bobbi Kristina. \\"She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it.\\" Brown appeared on episodes of Lifetime's brief reality show \\"The Houstons: On Our Own,\\" which followed life for the family after Houston's death. One of that reality show's storylines revolved around Brown's relationship with Nick Gordon, who lived with Houston and her daughter from the age of 12. Months later, Brown reportedly got engaged to Gordon. And in January 2014, she tweeted out a picture of wedding rings, presumably belonging to her and Gordon, along with the words, #HappilyMarriedâ€¢ SO#Inlove.\\"","completion":"Whitney Houston's daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, was placed in a medically induced coma after being found unresponsive and facedown in a bathtub full of water at her townhouse in Roswell, Georgia.

It's a lesson that Papa John's executives and shareholders are learning the hard way. \\"Very inexcusable and irresponsible comments\\" by company founder and former CEO John Schnatter caused same-store sales in July to plunge by about 10.5 percent, current CEO Steve Ritchie told analysts Tuesday in explaining the company's worse-than-expected performance during the the second quarter and drastically lowered sales forecasts for the year. That's not going to improve any time soon. The company, which reported earnings after the market closed, lowered its outlook for comparable stores, saying executives now expect sales at stores open for at least a year to fall between 7 percent and 10 percent this year. Papa John's previously estimated that they wouldn't fall by more than 3 percent. Its shares plummeted by almost 12 percent in aftermarket trading Tuesday. ||||| Despite its best efforts to rehabilitate its brand, Papa John's is still paying for offensive remarks made by its founder. John Schnatter admitted last month to using the N-word on a conference call. He apologized and resigned as Papa John's chairman soon after Forbes published a story about the incident. On Tuesday, the company said its same-store sales in North America fell 10.5% in July and 6.1% in the most recent quarter. \\"Results have been challenged by recent events,\\" Steve Ritchie, president and CEO of Papa John's (PZZA), said in a statement. \\"Our entire leadership team understands the importance of getting our culture and business improvements right.\\" Shares fell more than 10% after hours. On a call with analysts, Ritchie said that Papa John's stakeholders agreed with the company to take Schnatter out of the public eye. Related: Papa John's to pizza-eaters: We're listening \\"I have spent a significant amount of time in recent weeks in the field, talking with our franchisees, our customers, our drivers and employees,\\" he said. \\"Franchisees and partners have expressed overwhelming support for ... our decision to remove John as brand spokesperson.\\" \\"We are not dependent, nor should we be, on one person,\\" he said. Days after the racial slur scandal broke, Papa John's announced that it would remove Schnatter's image from its marketing materials, where he featured prominently. A special committee of the board of directors will oversee an outside auditor's investigation into Papa John's culture, including the company's existing processes, policies and systems related to diversity and inclusion. Ritchie said that Papa John's made the decision to distance itself from Schnatter after he said in November that the NFL protests hurt sales. \\"The research and analysis we conducted after comments by our founder in November of 2017 have made it clear that we needed to move away from a founder-centric marketing plan,\\" Ritchie said. \\"Obviously, the recent events have further evidenced that we need to move on.\\" Ritchie noted that comparable sales have slumped since November. Schnatter left the chief executive seat at his namesake company in December last year.

He remains on the board, and owns 29% of the company's stock. He has filed a lawsuit against the company, requesting to see company documents \\"because of the unexplained and heavy-handed way in which the company has treated him since the publication of a story that falsely accused him of using a racial slur.\\" Papa John's denied Schnatter's claims in a statement. The company said it was \\"saddened and disappointed\\" by the lawsuit, which it called \\"needless and wasteful.\\" Schnatter expressed concern over the health of the company in a statement published on Tuesday. \\"History shows that the Company performs better with me involved, and it declines when I step away,\\" he said. — CNN's Jordan Valinsky and Jackie Wattles contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","completion":"Papa John's is a pizza company that had some problems because the man who started it, John Schnatter, said some not nice words. This made a lot of people sad and they stopped buying pizzas from Papa John's. The people who work at Papa John's decided to not have John be the face of the company, but John is still a big part of the company since he owns a lot of it. They hope to make Papa John's better by changing some things in the company.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Record numbers of A-level students 'to be rejected from university' By Graeme Paton and Rachel Cooper Published: 10:00PM BST 26 Jun 2009 Research by The Daily Telegraph suggests demand for degree courses has surged by almost 65,000, even though few extra places are available. With the deadline for applications looming on Tuesday, numbers are believed to be up 11 per cent across Britain. The Conservatives warned a \\"major crisis\\" was looming as thousands more people push for university amid dire warnings of long-term job shortages. Vice-chancellors admitted entrance criteria would be dramatically tightened up, with the number of places handed out through clearing slumping to a new low. Many students missing conditional offers by a single grade, who would have been accepted in the past, could now be rejected, they said. More straight-A candidates will also miss out as the most sought-after universities fall back on interviews and entrance tests to find the best candidates. Universities have already been warned they face fines for over-recruiting this year. The pressure on places has been fuelled by a sharp rise in applications from mature students. Cambridge's four colleges which cater exclusively for over-21s all reported significant rises, with St Edmund's alone reporting a 52 per cent increase. But the Commons skills select committee warned this week that only 3,000 extra places across Britain would be made available in September - potentially leaving more than 60,000 without a place. This is on top of some 110,000 rejected every year after failing to meet entry requirements, applying too late or dropping out of the process. Amanda Brook, head of student recruitment at Exeter, said: \\"We have certainly had to reject more students who did not meet our AAA offers as we were only able to make offers at the very top of the range. Inevitably we will have to be stricter with those who miss their offer.\\" Professor Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire University, said: \\"We could see tens of thousands of students missing out on a place at their preferred university because they have missed their offer by one or two grades. Universities are going to be more nervous about letting people in.\\" Roderick Smith, admissions director at Birmingham, said there was a nine per cent rise overall, including a 65 per cent rise in the number of students studying economics. \\"In previous years, about 80 per cent of applicants would have been made an offer for that subject, but now only half of applicants will be made an offer,\\" he said. \\"We are having to assess people much more rigorously because we know we can't take more people. We're looking for the best students, with the best academic record and the right combination of A-levels. We're most definitely having to reject people who in the past would have been made an offer.\\" The ultimate deadline for applications is the end of June. Last year, 588,689 people applied for full time undergraduate courses. After accounting for students failing to make the grade or rejecting offers, a total of 456,627 gained places. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) warned that applications were up by almost nine per cent by the end of March compared to the same period in 2008. But research by The Telegraph suggests numbers have surged further in the last three months. A survey of 50 institutions shows an average 11 per cent rise which would result in 64,755 extra applicants this year. The research covered a range of small, specialist universities, former polytechnics and elite institutions. It follows pressure from Labour on teenagers to go on to university in recent years, combined with the lack of unskilled jobs for school-leavers in recession. Ministers originally promised 10,000 additional places would be created this year. But Phil Willis, chairman of the Commons skills select committee, said only 3,000 would be available for full-time undergraduates. Other places are likely to go to part-time students, while money is also used by universities who over-recruited last year. Newer universities, many of which specialise in work-based courses leading directly to a job, experienced the biggest rises. Bedfordshire reported a 28 per cent increase and applications to Portsmouth were up 23 per cent. Buckinghamshire New University reported a 33 per cent rise. Popular universities, such as Exeter and Leicester, saw applications rise 18 per cent while Oxford increased by 12 per cent. Applications soared among mature students, many of whom have been left without work in the recession - potentially squeezing out those joining straight from school or college. Worcestershire University reported a 37 per cent increase in applications from mature students. David Willetts, the Conservative shadow skills secretary, said: \\"Photos on A-level results day of pretty young women jumping for joy after receiving their A-level results will probably be replaced the next day with pictures of the same people in tears because they can't get into university. We have a major crisis looming and we'll have many students with very good A-level grades missing out.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \\"Next year there will be more students going to university than ever before, taking advantage of the record number of funded places on offer. There will be 40,000 more accepted applicants than just three years ago – and right now there are 300,000 more students in system since 1997. \\"Getting a place at university has always been, and should be, a competitive process. But there are a variety of options on offer for young people, including part-time study, apprenticeships and foundation degrees.\\" Summary:","completion":"A news article says that a lot of students who want to go to university might not get a chance because there are more people applying than there are spaces available. This means that some students who have good grades might still not be able to get in. Also, the universities are being very picky about who they let in because they don't want to have too many students. This problem is affecting students of all ages and might cause a big issue for everyone involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What does the shooting of the dog represent?\\" is in \\"The theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, \\"[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson .... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.\\"\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"The shooting of the dog in Harper Lee's classic novel, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" is a metaphorical representation of the pervasive societal bias, prejudice, and racism in the town of Maycomb, as per literary scholar Carolyn Jones' interpretation. In the storyline, it's not Atticus Finch, the protagonist's, duty to shoot the rabid dog, but he's compelled to do so as it poses danger. This reflects his role in Maycomb, a predominantly white southern town steeped in racist beliefs, where he's one of the few individuals willing to stand against prejudice and defend an African-American character, Tom Robinson. The dog is symbolic of the town’s irrational fear of African Americans, which, like the rabid dog, is seen as 'dangerous' and 'mad' without just cause. Atticus's situation during this incident - being alone on a deserted street to confront the rabid dog - parallels his later encounters in the novel where he wrestles with overcoming the town's racial bias virtually single-handedly. This is seen when he stands up to a lynch mob aiming to harm Tom Robinson and during Robinson's court trial where he takes on the daunting task of sheltering Robinson from the town's prejudiced fury, all while being devoid of support from the town's other white citizens. The dreamlike imagery used in the novel by Harper Lee during the mad dog incident is also mirrored in the courtroom scenes, creating a tangible link between the two events, thus further drawing attention to the symbolism of the dog. Through Atticus's actions, his exposing of himself to the town's anger becomes a symbol for his confrontation of the town's deep-rooted bias and irrational racial fear. Conclusively, the shooting of the dog is a substantial symbol in the novel that reflects the dangerous strain of prejudice running through Maycomb. Atticus's confrontation with the dog is indicative of his struggle against the toxic racism of the town which denies the humanity of Tom Robinson, thus proving the \\"real mad dog\\" of Maycomb to be racial prejudice itself."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The varnish protected and beautified the","completion":"wood panels, but unfortunately, it left unsightly marks on the concrete. Determined to remedy the situation, she researched appropriate cleaning solutions and techniques for removing varnish stains from concrete surfaces. Step 1: Identify the type of varnish Brenda first needed to identify the type of varnish that was used on the wood panels. Depending on whether it was oil-based or water-based, the cleaning solution and process could vary. She referred to the product label and found that it was an oil-based varnish. Step 2: Gather the necessary cleaning supplies After determining the type of varnish, Brenda gathered the necessary cleaning supplies. For an oil-based varnish, she needed a paint thinner or mineral spirits, a soft-bristled scrub brush, a cloth or sponge, clean water, gloves, and safety goggles to protect her hands and eyes from any potential chemical contact. Step 3: Apply the paint thinner Wearing gloves and safety goggles, Brenda applied a small amount of paint thinner to the stained concrete area. She allowed it to sit for about 10-15 minutes, giving the paint thinner enough time to penetrate the varnish and soften it. Step 4: Scrub the stained area Next, Brenda started scrubbing the stained area using the soft-bristled brush. She was careful not to scrub too hard, as she didn't want to damage the concrete surface. She gradually applied more pressure as the varnish began to break down. Step 5: Rinse and repeat if necessary After scrubbing the area, Brenda rinsed it with clean water. She inspected the concrete surface, looking for any remaining varnish stains. If any stains persisted, she would repeat the process of applying paint thinner, waiting, and scrubbing until the stain was completely gone. Step 6: Dispose of the waste materials Once the varnish stains were successfully removed, Brenda disposed of the waste materials according to her local waste disposal regulations. She properly sealed the container with the used paint thinner and placed the soiled cloth and scrub brush in a sealed plastic bag, ensuring safe disposal. Step 7: Clean and dry the concrete surface Lastly, Brenda cleaned the concrete surface with a mild detergent and water to remove any residual paint thinner or debris. She then allowed the surface to air dry completely. Through diligent research and careful execution of the cleaning process, Brenda was able to successfully remove the varnish stains from the concrete surface. Now, the wood panels were protected and beautified by the varnish, and the concrete surface was stain-free and restored to its original appearance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pennington kept the Dolphins at bay with a successful two-minute drill, finding tight end Chris Baker on a four-yard touchdown to close the first half and give the Jets a 21-13 halftime lead. The Jets attempted to further their lead opening the third quarter, but were stopped short of the goal line and had to settle for a 21-yard Mike Nugent field goal. The Dolphins tried to respond, but the Jets' defense forced their first takeaway of the season on the ensuing drive, an interception by Kerry Rhodes. Pennington led his offense downfield with the help of several Thomas Jones running plays before he ran into the end zone to give the Jets a 31-13 lead early in the fourth quarter. Miami would not go down quietly, however. Green quickly marched the Dolphins downfield to set up Brown's two-yard touchdown run. The Dolphins elected to attempt a two-point conversion to cut their deficit to ten; using a Statue of Liberty play, Brown walked into the end zone to complete the conversion. Although the Jets shed several minutes off the clock on their following possession, the Dolphins got the ball back and again were able to move swiftly downfield, where Brown scored his third touchdown on a 22-yard pass from Green. The Dolphins needed to recover an onside kick on the ensuing kickoff to have a chance to tie or win the game, but, despite a penalty moving the ball up ten yards, were unsuccessful, and Pennington knelt out the clock to give the Jets their first victory of the season.

Washington (CNN)New allegations have emerged from the man described as the 20th 9/11 hijacker, alleging members of the Saudi royal family supported al Qaeda. Zacarias Moussaoui, who pleaded guilty in 2005 to six terror-related charges, makes the allegations in a sworn statement contained in a brief submitted Tuesday as part of an ongoing civil case by the families of 9/11 victims. In the late 1990s, Moussaoui says, he was tasked by Osama bin Laden to create a digital database cataloging al Qaeda's donors. Every day for two or three months, he says, he entered names of the group's donors into a Toshiba computer, along with how much they gave. Moussaoui, who has been in U.S. custody for more than 13 years, said the list featured high-profile people, including several members of the Saudi Royal family, whom he named in his testimony. They include Prince Turki al-Faisal Al Saud, former director-general of Saudi Arabia's Foreign Intelligence Service and ambassador to the United States. Moussaoui, a French national, said he was chosen for the database job because of his education and ability to speak English. \\"Shaykh Osama wanted to keep a record who give money ... who is to be listened to or who contribute to -- to the jihad,\\" he said in sometimes stuttered answers. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims Moussaoui makes in his new testimony, which was made under oath as part of a brief filed in opposition to a motion to dismiss a case against Saudi Arabia for its alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks. Unlike a deposition, Moussaoui was not subjected to cross-examination by the defendants' lawyers. Moussaoui's credibility has been called into question before. And though Saudi Arabia's role in the attacks has long been a topic of suspicion, the 9/11 Commission's report, released in 2004, concluded there was no evidence the Saudi government funded al Qaeda. See also: ISIS captors 'didn't even have the Quran' \\"It does not appear that any government other than the Taliban financially supported al Qaeda before 9/11, although some governments may have contained al Qaeda sympathizers who turned a blind eye to al Qaeda's fund-raising activities,\\" the report said. \\"Saudi Arabia has long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding, but we have found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded the organization.\\" Still, the report noted in parentheses, \\"This conclusion does not exclude the likelihood that charities with significant Saudi government sponsorship diverted funds to al Qaeda.\\" In a statement reacting to these latest allegations, the Saudi Embassy in Washington said, \\"There is no evidence to support Moussaoui's claim. The Sept. 11 attack has been the most intensely investigated crime in history and the findings show no involvement by the Saudi government or Saudi officials.\\" The Saudi statement also referred to the assessment of the 9/11 Commission. \\"Moussaoui is a deranged criminal whose own lawyers presented evidence that he was mentally incompetent. His words have no credibility,\\" the statement said. \\"(Moussaoui's) goal in making these statements only serves to get attention for himself and try to do what he could not do through acts of terrorism -- to undermine Saudi-U.S. relations.\\" Moussaoui's new sworn statements were taken in October at a supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, where he has been held since his life sentence was handed down in 2006. Related: Saudi dilemma: How to spot potential terrorists. In them, Moussaoui goes on to say he met with members of the Saudi royal family in person more than once in Saudi Arabia, in order to hand-deliver letters to and from al Qaeda's notorious leader. \\"I was introduced as the messenger for Shaykh Osama bin Laden,\\" Moussaoui told attorneys on Oct. 21. \\"Did they treat you well during the [first] visit?\\" the lawyer asked. \\"Extremely well,\\" Moussaoui said. Moussaoui said he traveled on private jets and in limousines. His meetings took place in luxury hotels and even Saudi palaces. He was also given money for travel expenses at the Saudi Embassy in Islamabad, which he considered a bribe, he said. Furthermore, Moussaoui said his primary point of contact with the royal family was Prince Turki al-Faisal Al Saud, and that Turki introduced him to other prominent members of the family, including another former Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Bandar bin Sultan. Tuesday's court filing also included statements by three members of the 9/11 Commission, former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, and former Sens. Bob Graham and Bob Kerrey. Their statements do not support the specific claims Moussaoui makes, but do say that further investigation of Saudi government involvement is necessary. \\"I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the Sept. 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia,\\" Graham wrote. Kerrey told CNN on Friday that while he can't verify Moussaoui's specific allegations, he does believe the new information highlights the need for further investigation. \\"It deepens suspicions that everything about Saudi involvement is not as well-known as it should be,\\" he said. But this suspicion of the Saudi government is not shared by all. Robert Jordan, who was U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 2001 to 2003, told CNN he \\"was given no hint whatsoever of direct Saudi leadership involvement -- any financing or any planning -- for these attacks.\\" Jordan said he was regularly in touch with Robert Mueller and George Tenet, who led the FBI and CIA, respectively, and felt assured over the course of their investigation that allegations against the Saudi government were without merit. \\"A lot of it was my own questioning,\\" said Jordan.\\" 'Are you sure? Have you made certain that none of the people we're dealing with now at the senior level had anything to do with these attacks or with supporting the terrorists who financed and orchestrated them?' And I was routinely and universally given the information that they felt comfortable at least at the senior level they hadn't.\\" See also: Why Obama says fight with ISIS isn't a religious war. Moussaoui has made incriminating claims about the Saudi government before. Last November, he said that Saudi Embassy officials were involved in a plot to shoot down Air Force One \\"to assassinate Bill Clinton and/or Hillary Clinton.\\" He also said at that time that he had met with a Saudi prince and princess in early 2001 when he was taking flying lessons in Norman, Oklahoma, and that she \\"gave me money.\\" Lawyers for the Saudi government denied those claims, saying pointedly, \\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had no role in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\\" And the Saudis are not the only ones who have refuted Moussaoui's account of the 9/11 plot. In 2006, Osama bin Laden released an audiotape in which he denied Moussaoui's assertion that he was supposed to strike the White House with a 747 on September 11, 2001. \\"I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers,\\" bin Laden said, referring to the 19 known hijackers, \\"and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission.\\" Many -- if not all -- of Moussaoui's statements over the years have been called into question. During his 2006 sentencing trial, an expert witness testified that Moussaoui suffered from delusional paranoid schizophrenia. He was prone to loud and disruptive outbursts during that trial, and guards testified he would sometimes make irrational claims to them. He has also asked for certain concessions in exchange for testimony, such as a warmer cell in a different unit of the supermax prison. Beyond his claims about the donor database, Moussaoui also says in this latest sworn statement that he was involved in a series of other plots against U.S. targets. Specifically, he says he was given explosives training to attack the U.S. Embassy in London with a truck bomb. \\"I conducted a trial test of explosives for bomb of 750 kilogram of ammonium nitrate,\\" he said. \\"The plot was agreed with Shaykh Osama bin Laden.\\" Moussaoui said his team in that plot included Richard Reid, known as \\"the shoe bomber,\\" who Moussaoui previously said was supposed to take part in the 9/11 attacks -- allegations that Reid has denied. The plot against the embassy in London was eventually canceled, Moussaoui said, and he was sent to Malaysia to explore the possibility of attacking the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. That plot was also canceled, Moussaoui told his attorneys, so he went to the U.S. to look into attacking Air Force One -- the plot he first revealed in November. \\"My plan was not to launch the attack,\\" he insisted in the statement. \\"It was only to see the feasibility of the attack.\\" CNN's Jennifer Rizzo, Deborah Feyerick and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Zacarias Moussaoui, who has been described as the 20th 9/11 hijacker, alleges that members of the Saudi royal family supported al Qaeda in a sworn statement submitted as part of an ongoing civil case filed by the families of the 9/11 victims.

Here is an article: When I first saw this offer from Republic Wireless, I rubbed my eyes and looked for an asterisk leading to fine print that detailed a huge catch. But Republic, a division of a telecom company called Bandwidth.com, delivers exactly what it advertises. It can do so because the handset technology is a curious hybrid: it uses Wi-Fi when the customer is in a Wi-Fi area and Sprint Nextel’s 3G network when it is not. The concept brings together the best of two worlds: the low cost of voice calls carried over the Internet and the convenience of making calls to any phone number using a major carrier’s cellular network when Wi-Fi isn’t available. In my own case, on a typical day, I use my mobile phone mostly when I’m not actually mobile: I’m either at home or at work, perfectly positioned to use Wi-Fi at both locations. And I don’t even use the phone as a phone all that much. I use it mainly for e-mail and texts, neither of which requires enough bandwidth to benefit from the power of the fastest data networks. If you walk into a Verizon Wireless store and buy an iPhone 5, you’ll pay 60 or more a month for an unlimited talk and texting plan, depending on the data allocation for Internet use that you select to go with it. Some of that monthly charge goes toward repaying the carrier for the discounted price that makes a 649 iPhone seem as if it costs only 200. But most of the charge is for gaining access to the carrier’s wireless network. “We were looking at a mobile industry that had begun to charge extraordinary amounts of money, and we saw an industry opportunity that everybody else was missing: Wi-Fi is the new mobile,” says David Morken, co-founder and chief executive of Bandwidth, based in Raleigh, N.C. Smartphone apps that offer voice calls using data plans, not minutes allocated for calls, are plentiful. Just last month, Facebook quietly added an option that lets users of the iPhone version of Facebook Messenger place free voice calls to other Messenger users. But using those apps to make a call means the recipient has to run the same app, an irksome requirement that never comes up when using phones alone. Republic buys access to Sprint’s network on a wholesale basis for calls made outside of Wi-Fi areas. Its business model assumes, however, that Wi-Fi carries the load a majority of the time its phones are used. The company says that its service, even at 19 a month, is a profitable operation on a per-customer basis. “We don’t have to force people, or even ask people, how to behave,” Mr. Morken says. “Over 60 percent of the time that the phone is being used, on average, our users are using Wi-Fi and that number is only going up.” Last month, I tested a Republic handset, a Motorola Defy XT. It’s a light smartphone with a small screen, acceptable sound quality and great battery life. Republic’s Web site gently warns against acting like a “data hog” and encourages its customers to “play nice and try to use Wi-Fi as much as you can.” But scolding isn’t needed: Wi-Fi is faster than 3G, so users have an incentive to opt for Wi-Fi wherever it is available. The Motorola handset is the only one now offered by Republic, and it costs 259. The phone runs an older version of Android, and it has some first-generation glitches, like losing a connection when a caller starts out on a Wi-Fi network and then leaves the coverage area. (With a click, the call is resumed using Sprint’s cellular network.) Today most Wi-Fi access requires a logon. But that shouldn’t prove a great inconvenience: you can simply set up the phone once with Wi-Fi at home, then once more at the office. At other locations, users can ignore Wi-Fi availability and use 3G instead. Mr. Morken says a solution to the Wi-Fi-to-cellular handoff problem has been worked out in the company’s lab, and should be available midyear. Later this year, he also expects to offer more handset models, including one at the high end; he says they will run the latest version of Android. Matt Carter, president of the Global Wholesale and Emerging Solutions division at Sprint, asserted that the company was happy to serve as Republic’s supplier. When I asked whether Republic’s Wi-Fi-centric model, with its drastically lower price to the consumer, would pose a serious threat to the incumbent carriers, including Sprint, he said, “If the world operated based on just economic decisions, people wouldn’t go buy the most expensive cars on the planet, right?” Mr. Carter listed reasons that most consumers would prefer the wireless service obtained directly from a major carrier: a wider range of devices and the convenience of placing a call without having to tinker with Wi-Fi setup. Republic “will resonate with a sliver of the marketplace,” Mr. Carter said. He compared wireless carriers to the major airline carriers, which still control a majority of the market despite low-priced upstarts like JetBlue or Southwest, which he described as appealing only to “a certain segment of the population.” Philip Cusick, a J.P. Morgan analyst who covers telecommunications, says he doesn’t expect a major shift of customers to Republic Wireless. The price difference isn’t as great as it first appears, he says, when one considers that 80 percent of customers of AT&T and Verizon are on family or employer-related discount plans. MR. MORKEN of Bandwidth.com says he knows that his company must lower the price of its handset — the industry rule-of-thumb for no-contract wireless services is that a simple handset cannot cost more than 99 and a smartphone, 149. But if Republic can offer me an Android phone with a generously sized screen for a reasonable price, I don’t see why, with Wi-Fi available at work and home, I should continue to pay an expensive-sports-car price for my wireless service. “There’s a reason why the carriers around the world don’t want you using Wi-Fi for voice and text,” Mr. Morken says. “You will soon realize you shouldn’t have to pay what you’re paying today.” Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University.

The chilling episode unraveled while Nicky was taking her children to school after purchasing the car from a private seller in Hampshire on Sunday. The Ford Focus was bought from an auction site, where the former owner had assured potential buyers that there were \\"lots of years left in it.\\" However, the events that unfolded Monday morning expressed a vastly different story, with the vehicle bursting into flames and causing a harrowing experience for the mother and her children. The terrifying situation was first detected when her son James, 14, noticed something alarming. \\"Mum, my feet are on fire!\\" he exclaimed. Upon hearing this, Nicky Keefe immediately pulled over and managed to evacuate her children from the burning car, narrowly escaping a disaster that could have had far more severe consequences. Emergency services were called to the scene, and the fire was eventually extinguished. As the investigation is still ongoing, it remains unclear as to what exactly caused the vehicle to catch fire. However, it is evident that the family had a narrow escape from an incident that could have cost their lives. This incident has led to rising concerns about the reliability of vehicles sold on auction sites and their safety, especially when purchased from private sellers. Without proper inspection and background checks, the hidden dangers of buying a used car are too often overlooked, putting the buyer and their family at risk. In light of this traumatizing event, it is crucial for consumers looking to purchase a car, especially from a private seller, to ensure a thorough inspection by a certified mechanic before completion. Additionally, checking the vehicle's history and any outstanding recalls can be key in preventing accidents and guaranteeing the long-term safety of both the driver and passengers. Moreover, it is essential for auction sites and online marketplaces to enforce stricter policies for vehicles being sold on their platforms, particularly when they boast statements such as \\"lots of years left in it.\\" The timely reaction and level-headedness of Nicky Keefe undoubtedly played a significant role in averting any serious harm to herself and her children.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: To grasp where this 1976 version of A STAR IS BORN is coming from consider this: Its final number is sung by Barbra Streisand in a seven minute and forty second close-up, followed by another two-and-half-minute freeze frame of Ms. Streisand -- striking a Christ-like pose -- behind the closing credits. Over ten uninterrupted minutes of Barbra's distinctive visage dead center, filling the big screen with uncompromising ego. That just might be some sort of cinematic record. Or think about this: The plot of this musical revolves around a love affair between two musical superstars, yet, while Streisand's songs are performed in their entirety -- including the interminable finale -- her costar Kris Kristofferson isn't allowed to complete even one single song he performs. Nor, though she does allow him to contribute a little back up to a couple of her ditties, do they actually sing a duet. Or consider this: Streisand's name appears in the credits at least six times, including taking credit for \\"musical concepts\\" and her wardrobe (from her closet) -- and she also allegedly wanted, but failed to get co-directing credit as well. One of her credits was as executive producer, with a producer credit going to her then-boyfriend and former hairdresser, Jon Peters. As such, Streisand controlled the final cut of the film, which explains why it is so obsessed with skewing the film in her direction. What it doesn't explain is how come, given every opportunity to make The Great Diva look good, their efforts only make Streisand look bad. Even though this was one of Streisand's greatest box office hits, it is arguably her worst film and contains her worst performance. Anyway, moving the melodrama from Hollywood to the world of sex-drugs-and-rock'n'roll, Streisand plays Esther Hoffman, a pop singer on the road to stardom, who shares the fast lane for a while with Kristofferson's John Norman Howard, a hard rocker heading for the off ramp to Has-beenville. In the previous incarnations of the story, \\"Norman Maine\\" sacrifices his leading man career to help newcomer \\"Vicky Lester\\" achieve her success. In the feminist seventies, Streisand & Co. want to make it clear that their heroine owes nothing to a man, so the trajectory is skewed; she'll succeed with or without him and he is pretty much near bottom from scene one; he's a burden she must endure in the name of love. As such, there is an obvious effort to make the leading lady not just tougher, but almost ruthless, while her paramour comes off as a henpecked twit. Kristofferson schleps through the film with a credible indifference to the material; making little attempt to give much of a performance, and oddly it serves his aimless, listless character well. Streisand, on the other hand, exhibits not one moment of honesty in her entire time on screen. Everything she does seems, if not too rehearsed, at least too controlled. Even her apparent ad libs seem awkwardly premeditated and her moments of supposed hysteria coldly mechanical. The two have no chemistry, making the central love affair totally unbelievable. You might presume that his character sees in her a symbol of his fading youth and innocence, though at age 34, Streisand doesn't seem particularly young or naive. The only conceivable attraction he might offer to her is that she can exploit him as a faster route to stardom. And, indeed, had the film had the guts to actually play the material that way, to make Streisand's character openly play an exploitive villain, the film might have had a spark and maybe a reason to exist. But I guess the filmmakers actually see Esther as a sympathetic victim; they don't seem to be aware just how cold-blooded and self absorbed she is. But sensitivity is not one of the film's strong points: note the petty joke of giving Barbra two African American back up singers just so the film can indulge in the lame racism of calling the trio The Oreos. And the film makes a big deal of pointing out that Esther retains her ethnic identity by using her given name of Hoffman, yet the filmmakers have changed the character's name of the previous films from \\"Esther Blodgett\\" so that Streisand won't be burdened with a name that is too Jewish or too unattractive. So much for ethnic pride. The backstage back stabbing and backbiting that proceeded the film's release is near legendary, so the fact that the film ended up looking so polished is remarkable. Nominal director Frank Pierson seems to have delivered the raw material for a good movie, with considerable help from ace cinematographer Robert Surtees. And the film did serve its purpose, producing a soundtrack album of decent pop tunes (including the Oscar-winning \\"Evergreen\\" by Paul Williams and Streisand). But overall the film turned out to be the one thing Streisand reportedly claimed she didn't want it to be, a vanity project.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer criticizes the 1976 version of \\"A Star is Born\\" for a number of reasons, focusing on the film's perceived overemphasis on Barbra Streisand, both in terms of screen time and control over the film's production. They argue that this focus on Streisand and her character, Esther Hoffman, detracts from the movie's central love story and makes Streisand's performance feel contrived and unnatural. Criticism is also directed towards Streisand's co-star, Kris Kristofferson, whose character is portrayed as being overshadowed by Streisand's, suppressing the development of his performance and their on-screen chemistry. The reviewer asserts that the film could have potentially been more successful if Streisand's character was portrayed in a more villainous light or if the relationship between the two main characters was explored more deeply. Additionally, the reviewer takes issue with certain aspects of the film they perceive as insincere or superficial, such as Streisand's on-screen choice to use her original name for the character, the lack of ethnic and cultural pride conveyed through the film's characters, and the modifications made to the character's original name from previous adaptations. Positive aspects of the film mentioned are the polished appearance and technical quality of the film as well as the soundtrack, which features notable songs like the Oscar-winning \\"Evergreen.\\" However, despite these positive elements, the overall sentiment presented in this review is negative, with the reviewer stating that the film ultimately comes across as a vanity project for Barbra Streisand, ultimately detracting from the story and its potential impact on the audience."},{"prompt":"Q: What are the three types of muscle tissue in the body?

The goal is to create a new list that contains all the elements of list 'A' except for the last 'i' elements. Here, 'i' will always be less than the length of the list 'A'. Let's break down the given example: Input: i = 2 A = ['7843', 'H', 'w', '1349', 't', 'V', 'd', '3641', 'J', 'X', 'n', '6153', 'A', 'm', '3785', '2849', 'E', 'C', 'A', '4077', '7695', '7111', 'a'] Steps to perform: 1. Calculate the length of the list 'A' (let's call it 'n' ). In this example, n = 23. 2. Calculate the index up to which we need to extract elements from 'A'. In this case, it is 'n-i'. Here, n=23 and i=2, so 23-2=21. So, we need to extract elements up to the index 21 (excluding the element at index 21). 3. Create a new list (let's call it 'B') by taking all the elements from 'A' up to the calculated index (21 in this case). 4. The resulting list 'B' will have all the elements except the last 'i' elements from list 'A'.

Summarize: So at least they could ask each other here - in the face of that horror, and a series of other recent atrocities in Beirut, in Iraq, and in the skies over the Sinai desert: \\"Can we put aside some of our differences and do better when we take on the extremists?\\" The most obvious progress, however fragile, was over Syria, described by French president Francois Hollande as \\"the greatest factory of terrorism the world has ever seen\\". For more than four years, Syria has been laid waste by a civil war of increasing savagery. Large areas have emptied of people, leaving ungoverned space for IS extremists to seize. So ending the war - somehow - is now even more imperative. President Vladimir Putin is key. Russia too is an IS victim now. So has he been brought closer to the US-led coalition, or they closer to him? Britain's Prime Minister, David Cameron, had face-to-face talks with Mr Putin. They did break down some of the profound differences between Russia and the West over that intractable Syrian civil war. Mr Cameron told President Putin Russian bombing of the moderate opposition in Syria was a \\"mistake\\". Then, after their talks, Mr Cameron said that was changing: \\"I think there are some signs, some signs, that they are focusing more on IS, but we need to see that continued. \\"The gap has been enormous between those of us who believe [Syria's President Bashar al-]Assad should go immediately and those, like President Putin, who have been supporting him, who continue to support him. I think everyone recognises the need for compromise.\\" The hope is that prospects for a peace process supervised by the United Nations are now improving, although substantial obstacles remain. The prize, of course, would be an eventual democratic settlement in Syria. At the G20, President Putin said Russia had changed tactics, focusing its bombing on IS, not on moderate opposition forces ranged against President Assad. Russia was actually starting to work with some of the Western-backed groups. The Russian President used his closing press conference to declare: \\"Currently, on the battlefield, we have established contact with a part of the armed Syrian opposition who have asked us not to strike territories under their control. \\"We have come to an agreement with them, and we are following it. In addition, when the armed opposition can actively fight terrorist groups, we are prepared to provide them with our air support\\". Western leaders will be keen to verify that. As for US President Barack Obama, he said the military coalition working with the US had taken territory back from IS and was denying them all-important space in which to train and to plot attacks. But President Obama again rejected committing substantial US ground forces, while arguing patience would be rewarded. \\"There will be an intensification of the strategy that we put forward, the strategy that is ultimately going to work, but, as as I said from the start, it is going to take time,\\" he said. More than that, President Obama stressed a world united against \\"the face of evil\\" would prevail. But I have to report, listening to him in Turkey, he was not sounding his usual confident self. It was more the uncertain commander-in-chief. \\"There are going to be some things we try that don't work, and some strategies that do, and when we find ones that do, we will double down on those,\\" he said. President Obama even downplayed what he called \\"modest\\" diplomatic progress on Syria. Still, the heads of government did agree on a range of measures, including to share intelligence better, as well as to strengthen aviation security. The trouble is they sorely need those improvements, after devastating failures that apparently made destroying the Russian airliner possible and let some of those who carried out the Paris attacks move around Europe unchecked. This was a G20 like no other. Summary:","completion":"At the G20 summit in Turkey, world leaders discussed the necessity of setting aside some differences and uniting against the growing threat of extremism, particularly in light of recent terror attacks. Discussions focused on the Syrian crisis, with French president Francois Hollande describing the nation as \\"the greatest factory of terrorism the world has ever seen.\\" Leaders aimed to find common ground and compromise over the role of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Russia's bombing campaign, and potential United Nations involvement in a peace process.

It names someone to serve as your agent. Choices: (a). It also names another, more user-oriented person, e.g., your spouse, or the attorney you've charged with administering the care of this person. The purpose of an alive will is to affirm that you're responsible for the person's health and well-being.; (b). It identifies your caregiver or another physician you can rely on to authorize the treatment.

Choose the right person for the responsibilities and it could be anyone from a minor to a marine general. Everyone in a medical setting should always know the purpose of the property.;","completion":"(c). This person, often a spouse or family member, consults the information provided in the documents and makes decisions about your care. Learn the risks not having a living will. After understanding the purpose of a living will, the most logical next event would be choosing someone that will help make important decisions pertaining to your care, usually someone you trust and who knows your values and preferences. This person may be a spouse or a close family member. It is essential to provide this person with all the necessary information to make the most informed decisions possible. Once you have chosen your representative, the next step is to become aware of the potential risks and consequences that can occur if you do not have a living will. Understanding these risks will help you make better decisions about what to include in your document and will underscore the importance of having a living will in the first place. The risks of not having a living will can include: 1. Prolonged suffering: Without clear instructions, you may receive unwanted medical treatment that prolongs your suffering or delays the dying process. 2. Family disputes: In the absence of a living will, family members may disagree on the appropriate course of action, which may cause emotional distress, tension, and possibly legal battles. 3. Compromised patient autonomy: Without a living will, medical professionals may have to make difficult decisions on your behalf, which might not explicitly align with your desires or preferences. 4. Financial burden: The cost of extended medical treatment, particularly in the case of life-support measures, could cause undue financial strain on your loved ones. To prevent these potential risks, it is essential to create a comprehensive and legally binding living will. Start by discussing your healthcare preferences with your appointed representative and your healthcare professionals. Additionally, research the laws governing living wills in your area, as the requirements may vary among countries or states. Once you have completed the living will, ensure that it is easily accessible to your medical representative and healthcare providers. It can also be helpful to provide copies to any relevant physicians, hospitals, or nursing homes that may be involved in your care. In summary, the most logical next event in creating a living will is selecting a trusted individual to help make important decisions on your behalf, followed by understanding the risks of not drafting a comprehensive and legally binding living will. This knowledge will guide your decision-making process and ensure that your healthcare preferences are adhered to when needed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
