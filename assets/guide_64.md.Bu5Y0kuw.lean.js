Article: Story highlights Two other people were shot and are in critical condition Police say shooting wasn't random but decline to speculate on motive The gunman died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police say Police will be interviewing at least two dozen witnesses A gunman and another person were killed during a shooting Tuesday at a medical building near the Renown Regional Medical Center, said Tom Robinson of the Reno, Nevada, Police Department. Two other people were wounded and were in critical condition, Robinson said. The shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said. Police don't have a motive, but Robinson said it was not a random act. Kat Raco, an ophthalmic technician who works on the second floor of the Nevada Advanced Medicine building, told CNN that she heard at least two large booms and then the sound of scampering feet above her. The shooter opened fire after going to the urology office of Nevada Advanced Medicine on the third floor, said Sharon Spangler, spokeswoman for Reno Police. Raco said she and others in her office were seeing patients when the shooting occurred and first thought someone or something had fallen. Police were there quickly, she said, telling them to lock the doors and not let anyone in. About 10 minutes after that, more police escorted everyone on the second floor to a catwalk between the building and a parking garage. A plain-clothed officer asked questions before staff was allowed to leave about 45 minutes after the shooting. JUST WATCHED Police: 2 dead, 2 hurt in Reno shooting Replay More Videos ...

Earlier, the University of Nevada police tweeted that there was an active shooter and faculty, staff and students should find shelter where they were. CNN first learned of the shooting through the university police department's Twitter account. The medical center describes itself as the only Level II trauma center in that region of Nevada and is home to the area's only Children's Hospital, its website says. The facility also offers the region's largest number of clinical research trials. Last month, there was a hospital shooting in Wisconsin when police shot and wounded an armed man on the neonatal intensive care floor of a Milwaukee-area children's hospital, authorities said. Milwaukee police had gone to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to arrest the man on a felony warrant and found him holding a child in the intensive care unit, authorities said. Instead of surrendering, the man took out a handgun and fled down a hallway, prompting police to shoot him. ||||| A lone gunman shot and injured four people before killing himself at a hospital building in Reno, Nev.

Information: - The quest for the historical Jesus refers to academic efforts to provide a historical portrait of Jesus. Since the 18th century, three scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during each specific phase. These quests are distinguished from earlier approaches because they rely on the historical method to study biblical narratives. While textual analysis of biblical sources had taken place for centuries, these quests introduced new methods and specific techniques to establish the historical validity of their conclusions. - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived. - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church. - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion. - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars. - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus. - The New Testament (Koine Greek: , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music. - John the Apostle ( Aramaic : Yohanan Shliha ; Hebrew : Yohanan Ben Zavdai ; Koine Greek : ; Latin : Ioannes ; c. AD 6 -- c. 106 ) was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome . His brother was James , who was another of the Twelve Apostles . Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one not to die a martyr 's death ( excluding Judas Iscariot who died by suicide ) . The Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist , John of Patmos , and the Beloved Disciple , although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these mean . The tradition of some Christian denominations holds that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament . - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions. What is the relationship between 'john the apostle' and 'historical jesus'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"John the Apostle was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. He was a close disciple and follower of Jesus during his ministry. As one of the key figures in early Christianity, John the Apostle had a personal relationship with Jesus, and he was an eyewitness to many events in Jesus' life. The Gospel of John, traditionally attributed to John the Apostle, contains accounts of Jesus' life, teachings, and miracles, providing significant information about the historical Jesus. However, modern scholars have debated the authorship of the Gospel of John and whether it can be directly attributed to John the Apostle. In summary, John the Apostle was a close follower of Jesus and potentially contributed a crucial source for our understanding of the historical Jesus, although the precise nature of the relationship between John's Gospel and the historical Jesus continues to be a subject of scholarly debate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - Amersham is a market town and civil parish within Chiltern district in Buckinghamshire, England, north west of London, in the Chiltern Hills. It is part of the London commuter belt. Amersham is also from Aylesbury and from High Wycombe. - The Piccadilly line is a line of the London Underground, coloured dark blue on the Tube map. It is the fourth busiest line on the Underground network on the basis of the number of passengers transported per year with 210,000,000. It is mainly a deep-level line, running from the north to the west of London via Zone 1, with a number of surface sections, mostly in its westernmost parts. It is named after the road above it between Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus. Some of its stations are shared with the District line and some are shared with the Metropolitan line. It is the second longest line on the system, after the Central line, and has the second most stations, after the District line. It serves many of London's top tourist attractions including Harrods (Knightsbridge), Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace (within walking distance from Green Park), Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square and Covent Garden, as well as London Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport in Europe. The line shares tracks with the Metropolitan line between Uxbridge and Rayners Lane, and with the District line between Hanger Lane Junction and Acton Town, then runs parallel with the District line between Acton Town and Barons Court. - In cryptography, MAGENTA is a symmetric key block cipher developed by Michael Jacobson Jr. and Klaus Huber for Deutsche Telekom. The name MAGENTA is an acronym for Multifunctional Algorithm for General-purpose Encryption and Network Telecommunication Applications. (The color magenta is also part of the corporate identity of Deutsche Telekom.) The cipher was submitted to the Advanced Encryption Standard process, but did not advance beyond the first round; cryptographic weaknesses were discovered and it was found to be one of the slower ciphers submitted. - The Tube map is a schematic transport map of the lines, stations and services of London's public transport systems, the primary system being London Underground, known colloquially as \\"the Tube\\", hence the map's name. The first schematic Tube map was designed by Harry Beck in 1931, and it has since been expanded to also include today the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, TfL Rail, Tramlink and the Emirates Air Line cable car.

Write an article based on this summary: Saudi Arabia is responding to the recent Russian air strikes on Syrian rebels by stepping up its supplies of lethal weaponry to three different rebel groups, a Saudi government official has told the BBC.","completion":"Title: Saudi Arabia Increases Weapon Supply to Syrian Rebels in Response to Russian Air Strikes Introduction: In light of recent Russian air strikes on Syrian rebels, a Saudi government official has informed the BBC that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is stepping up its supplies of lethal weaponry to three different rebel groups. This move, a direct response to Russian aggression, demonstrates the escalating tensions and involvement of global powers in the Syrian conflict. Step 1: Provide background on the Syrian conflict The Syrian civil war, ongoing since 2011, has claimed countless lives and created a global refugee crisis. The multi-faceted conflict has seen both regional and global actors taking sides, with Russia and Iran supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and countries such as the United States, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia backing various rebel factions. Step 2: Detail the Russian air strikes In recent weeks, Russia has launched air strikes targeting Syrian rebels, resulting in civilian casualties and drawing criticism from Western countries. Russian officials maintain that their actions are aimed at combatting terrorism and stabilizing the region, but critics argue that Russia's true intent is to prop up the Assad regime. Step 3: Explain Saudi Arabia's role in the conflict Saudi Arabia has been a key supporter of the Syrian opposition battling Assad's forces. They have long supplied arms and financial assistance to various rebel groups, seeing Assad's downfall as instrumental in countering Iranian influence in the region. Step 4: Describe the increase in weapon supplies and the motivation behind it In response to the Russian air strikes, a Saudi government official revealed to the BBC that the nation has increased its supply of lethal weaponry to three different rebel factions. This move is intended to directly counter Russian aggression and support the opposition in their fight against Assad's forces. Step 5: Discuss the potential consequences of Saudi Arabia's actions Increased weapon supplies to Syrian rebels could lead to further escalation of the conflict, as well as heightened tensions between global powers involved in the region. This move may trigger further intervention by other countries, potentially leading to a widening of the proxy war and increased instability in an already volatile region. Conclusion: As the Syrian conflict continues to evolve, the reported increase in weapon supplies by Saudi Arabia to rebel groups indicates a deepening involvement in the war. With each new development, the ongoing struggle in Syria becomes more complex, and the need for a resolution becomes even more urgent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi). - Bushrangers were originally escaped convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who had the survival skills necessary to use the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities. By the 1820s, the term \\"bushranger\\" had evolved to refer to those who abandoned social rights and privileges to take up \\"robbery under arms\\" as a way of life, using the bush as their base. Bushranging thrived during the gold rush years of the 1850s and 1860s when the likes of Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert led notorious gangs in the country districts of New South Wales. These \\"Wild Colonial Boys\\", mostly Australian-born sons of convicts, were roughly analogous to British \\"highwaymen\\" and outlaws of the American Old West, and their crimes typically included robbing small-town banks and coach services. In other infamous cases, such as that of Dan Morgan, the Clarke brothers, and Australia's best-known bushranger, Ned Kelly, numerous policemen were murdered. The number of bushrangers declined due to better policing and improvements in rail transport and communication technology, such as telegraphy. Kelly's capture and execution in 1880 effectively represented the end of the bushranging era. - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean.

These techniques are meant to provide basic necessities for human life which include water, food, and shelter. The skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over a period of time. Survival skills are often basic ideas and abilities that ancients invented and used themselves for thousands of years. Outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, and hunting all require basic wilderness survival skills, especially in handling emergency situations. Bushcraft and primitive living are most often self-implemented, but require many of the same skills. - A gold rush is a new discovery of gold that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune.

After being convicted under the alias Francis Melville , McCallum was transported to Tasmania ( then known as Van Diemen 's Land ) as a convict in 1838 , aged 15 , and left for Melbourne about October 1851 . During 1852 as Captain Melville he was alleged to have led a large band of bushrangers on the roads in the Black Forest between Melbourne and Ballarat , and gained a folkloric reputation through the boldness of his outrages and the chivalry he showed to many , especially women . His name was associated with the Nelson robbery and St Kilda Road robberies , probably without foundation as in reality he seems to have spent most of his time bailing up diggers around Mount Macedon , either on his own or with one or two mates . On Christmas Eve 1852 , when under the alias of Thomas Smith , he and fellow bushranger William Robert Roberts were arrested at a brothel in Corio Street , Geelong , and eventually faced Judge Redmond Barry at the Geelong Circuit Court on 3 February 1853 on three counts of robbery . Barry sentenced both men to twelve , ten and ten years on each count , respectively -- in Melville 's case to be served consecutively . Although employed in chains on the roads of Victoria by the time of the Melbourne Private Escort Robbery of 20 July 1853 , Captain Melville 's name has become associated with it over the years because of the coincidence of one of the Escort robbers , George Melville , using the same surname as his alias . In 1854 he was one of a party of prisoners based on the prison hulk Success in Port Phillip Bay who attempted to seize and escape in a boat , during which a warder was killed . Sentenced to death but reprieved , he was then sent to Old Melbourne Gaol , where he was found hanged in his cell on 10 August 1857 . - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of .

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The Victorian gold rush was a period in the history of Victoria, Australia approximately between 1851 and the late 1860s. - Brothers Thomas (c. 1840 25 June 1867) and John Clarke (c. 1846 25 June 1867) were Australian bushrangers from the Braidwood district of New South Wales. They were responsible for a series of high-profile robberies and murders which led to the embedding of the \\"Felons' Apprehension Act (1866)\\", a law that introduced the concept of outlawry and authorised citizens to kill bushrangers on sight. Active in the southern goldfields from 1865, Thomas, John, their brother James and several other relations were responsible for a reported 36 hold-ups and the deaths of five policemenfour of them bounty hunters looking to bring them in. Some modern-day writers have described the Clarkes as the most bloodthirsty bushrangers of all. They were captured during a shoot-out in April 1867 and hanged two months later at Sydney's Darlinghurst Gaol. Their execution ended organised gang bushranging in New South Wales. - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia.

Just under two-thirds of the state's population, 4.67 million, live in the Greater Sydney area. Inhabitants of New South Wales are referred to as \\"New South Welshmen\\". - Frank Gardiner (1830 c. 1903?) was an Australian bushranger. Sources differ as to his origins. Some have him as a Currency Lad, native-born near Goulburn, New South Wales around 1830, others that he was Scottish-born, and migrated to Australia as a child with his parents in 1834. His real name was Francis Christie, though he often used one of several other aliases including Gardiner, Clarke or Christie. He supposedly took the name Gardiner after a man who lived for some years with his family and who had taught him how to ride and break in horses. He continued to use the surname Gardiner when he moved to the United States. What entity does 'frank mccallum' has the relation 'given name' with?

Eric Greenberg said he thought wines he sold, which made about 42m in eight years of auctions, were authentic. The lawsuit alleged Bordeaux wine had been labelled to suggest it was bottled between 1864 and 1950. Two dozen bottles of the fake wine were fraudulently sold to him at an auction in 2005, Mr Koch alleged. \\"Out of sight! Over the moon!\\" said Mr Koch said, laughing, outside a court in New York. \\"We weren't even expecting any damages and we got 12 million. Unbelievable!\\" As he left the court with his lawyer, each of them displayed one of the bottles at stake in the trial. Mr Koch, an energy magnate and brother of major US industrialists David and Charles Koch, also said he would use the settlement to help eliminate fraud in the wine auction market and would create a website to help spot fake wines and their dealers. But Mr Greenberg, a businessman from California, said the outcome of the trial was \\"a disappointment because I believed all the consigned wine to be authentic,\\" in a statement. \\"We believe that we acted honourably and tried to do the right thing for all concerned,\\" he added, saying he would appeal against the verdict. In an earlier statement to the jury, Mr Greenberg suggested the case had cost the two parties a total of 17m. \\"I'm very sorry I had counterfeit wine. It's a horrible thing. Both of us have lost millions of dollars.\\" After the ruling, one juror described how they decided how much should be paid to Mr Koch in damages. He said the jurors wrote down the amount they thought was fair and averaged it.

The village is attacked by dragons, who steal food (mostly sheep) and set things on fire (hence all the new buildings). The villagers grab weapons and try to fight the dragons off. Despite being told by every adult in sight to go indoors, Hiccup hauls out a bolas-shooting cannon he made himself and shoots a dragon out of the night sky. (As assistant to the village blacksmith, Gobber (voice: Craig Ferguson), Hiccup has access to tools and materials and knows how to use them.) The dragon lands in the woods some distance form the village and no one believes that he hit anything, so it's the next day before Hiccup can go looking for it. It turns out to be a rare and deadly Night Fury, but Hiccup can't make himself kill it. Instead he releases it -- whereupon it also refrains from killing Hiccup -- and it flies off through the trees.Hiccup discovers that the dragon (which he eventually calls Toothless because of its retractable teeth) has holed up in a steep-sided valley because it can no longer fly more than a few feet at a time. While sketching the dragon, Hiccup realizes that it's missing a tail fin. He makes a prosthetic tail fin out of leather. The new fin helps, but Toothless can't control it and inadvertently takes Hiccup for a ride, giving him a clear idea of what's needed to help the dragon fly right. In a series of workshop and test flight scenes, Hiccup builds and perfects a saddle, a control mechanism for the tail fin, and a safety harness.Meanwhile, Hiccup's father Stoick (voice: Gerard Butler) has signed him up for dragon training with Gobber, which is very different from the training he's already doing with Toothless: he's going to learn to fight dragons.

Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method — that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.

A proposed health-care compromise by the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee lacks a government-run insurance option favored by Democrats and would tax the most expensive health insurance plans, a source close to the discussions told CNN Monday. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, is the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. As expected, the proposal from Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, excludes the public insurance option to compete with private insurers. However, it would allow for the creation of nonprofit health care cooperatives -- an idea that some moderate Democrats and Republicans have expressed possible interest in supporting. The potential compromise proposal was sent to key Finance Committee negotiators Saturday night. It is considered a last-ditch effort to secure Republican votes for a health-care bill as President Obama pushes the issue with a planned speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night. So far, none of the three Republican senators involved in talks with Baucus on the compromise have indicated whether they support the version he is proposing. Congressional liberals are pushing strongly for inclusion of a public option; conservatives are sharply opposed. Obama has said he supports a public option but has not clearly indicated he will veto a bill that fails to include it. On Monday, Obama reiterated his support for a public option in a Labor Day speech to a union gathering in Cincinnati. He outlined Democratic health-care proposals that include a public option as part of a menu of insurance choices, including private health-care plans, that the legislation would create. \\"I continue to believe that a public option within that basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs,\\" Obama said to loud cheers. The president also indicated he would push hard for the House and Senate to move forward on passing health-care legislation in his upcoming address to Congress. \\"The Congress and the country have been engaged in a vigorous debate for many months,\\" Obama said. \\"And the debate has been good, and that's important because we have to get this right. \\"But every debate at some point comes to an end,\\" he continued, to growing applause. \\"At some point, it's time to decide. At some point, it's time to act. And Ohio, it's time to act to get this done.\\" Baucus' bill would cost less than 900 billion over 10 years, according to the source who spoke to CNN. The price tag is at least 100 billion less than any other health-care reform bill under consideration by Congress, the source said. As with other reform proposals, the bill would bar insurance companies from dropping a policyholder in the event of illness as long as that person has paid his or her premium in full. It adds new protections for people with pre-existing conditions and establishes tax credits to help low and middle-income families purchase insurance coverage, the source noted. It creates health insurance exchanges to make it easier for small groups and individuals to buy insurance. The bill would be paid for, in part, by a new tax on health insurance companies that provide high-end \\"Cadillac\\" insurance plans, the source added. Supporters of such a tax -- initially proposed by Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and other Democrats several weeks ago -- say will it help curb the cost of health care by discouraging employers from offering such plans. They also argue that consumers, in turn, will be discouraged from overusing the health care system. Watch senators discuss health care talks ». Critics claim the new tax will cause insurance companies to raise rates on all of their customers, even those without more expensive plans. The so-called \\"Gang of Six\\" Senate negotiators -- a group of three Democrats and three Republicans on the Finance Committee -- is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss the proposal. The source, while stressing that the proposed bill is not a final product, said it closely reflects the group's work and areas of agreement. Obama's planned speech to Congress reflects how overhauling the nation's ailing health-care system has become his top domestic priority. He laced his speech Monday with references to health care costs rising at three times the rate of wages, and insurance industry practices that deny coverage for pre-existing conditions or prevent people from obtaining coverage if they lose their jobs. Multiple sources told CNN Friday that the administration is preparing for the possibility of delivering its own legislation to Capitol Hill sometime after the president's address. One source called the possibility of new legislation a \\"contingency\\" approach if efforts by Baucus to craft a deal fall through. A big open question is whether two Republican members of the Gang of Six -- Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming -- will support the bipartisan proposal. White House and Democratic leadership sources have said for some time they do not think Grassley and Enzi will sign on. A source close to the White House said Friday that the administration is leaning toward dropping the public option, and continues to zero in on trying to convince moderate Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe, another of the Senate Finance Committee negotiators, to come on board. Snowe and the White House have been discussing a trigger provision that would mandate creation of a public health insurance option if specific thresholds for expanded coverage and other changes are not met. Support by Snowe would improve the chances of the Senate's Democratic majority to compile the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Republican filibuster against a health care bill. The Senate Finance Committee is the last of five congressional committees needed to approve health-care legislation before it can be taken up by the full Senate and House of Representatives. Different forms of the legislation proposed by Democrats have already cleared three House committees, as well as the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Thursday, May 15, 2014 file photo, from left, Mohammed Fahmy, Canadian-Egyptian acting bureau chief of Al-Jazeera, Australian correspondent Peter Greste, and Egyptian producer Baher Mohamed... (Associated Press) FILE - In this May 3, 2014 file photo, Al-Jazeera's award-winning Australian correspondent Peter Greste appears in a defendants' cage in the Police Academy courthouse along with several other defendants... (Associated Press) The three, Australian Peter Greste, Canadian-Egyptian Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed, have been detained since a December raid on their Cairo hotel room, which they were using as an office as they covered protests by supporters of the ousted Islamist president. The raid was part of a broad crackdown against Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood. They had pleaded innocent, saying they were simply doing their jobs as journalists. But they were charged with supporting the Brotherhood, which has been declared a terrorist organization, and of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's national security and make it appear the country was facing civil war. The prosecution provided little evidence in the case, showing video footage found in their possession — most of which had nothing to do with the case, including a report on a veterinary hospital in Cairo, Christian life and old footage of Greste from previous assignments elsewhere in Africa. \\"I swear they will pay for this,\\" Fahmy, who was Al-Jazeera English's acting Cairo bureau chief, shouted angrily from the defendants' cage after the sentences were announced in the Cairo court Monday. Greste, a correspondent, raised his fists in the air. \\"They just ruined a family,\\" said Fahmy's brother Adel, who was attending the session. He said they would appeal the verdict but added that he had little faith in the system. \\"Everything is corrupt,\\" he said. Greste's brother Andrew said he was \\"gutted\\" and also vowed to appeal. Australian Foreign Minister Julia Bishop said, \\"We are all shocked by this verdict,\\" adding that the government would contact newly elected Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and ask him to intervene in the case. \\"The Australian government urges the new government of Egypt to reflect what message is being sent to the world,\\" she said. \\"We are deeply concerned that this verdict is part of a broader attempt to muzzle media freedoms.\\" The three received sentences of seven years each in a maximum security prison. Mohammed, the team's producer, received an extra three years because of additional charges of possession of ammunition. Al-Jazeera has said that charge was rooted in a spent shell found in his possession — a souvenir he'd picked up from protests. There were 17 other co-defendants in the case. Among them, two British journalists and a Dutch journalist who were not in Egypt and eight others being tried in absentia each received 10-year prison sentences. Two of them were acquitted, including the son of Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood. Most of the co-defendants were students, arrested separately and accused of giving footage to the journalists. The managing director of Qatar-based Al-Jazeera English, Al Anstey, said in a statement that \\"not a shred of evidence was found to support the extraordinary and false charges against them.\\" \\"To have detained them for 177 days is an outrage. To have sentenced them defies logic, sense, and any semblance of justice,\\" he said. The arrests of the journalists were part of a broad crackdown on the Brotherhood and other Islamists who have been holding protests since the July 3 ouster of President Mohammed Morsi by el-Sissi, the head of the military at the time. Security forces have killed hundreds of Morsi supporters and arrested thousands more. The crackdown has already raised fears of suppression of any form of dissent, since police have also arrested non-Islamist opponents, largely for breaking a draconian law passed in December banning protests without a prior police permit. Attending the session, Canadian ambassador David Drake said there are many questions over the verdict. \\"We are very disappointed,\\" he said. \\"We are digesting this ... We have to put our faith in the judicial system. We don't understand this particular verdict.\\" British ambassador James Watt also said he was disappointed, adding, \\"Freedom of expression is fundamental to any democracy.\\" Before the verdicts, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday he spoke with el-Sissi over the weekend and told him that Greste was innocent. \\"I did make the point that as an Australian journalist, Peter Greste would not have been supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, he would have simply been reporting on the Muslim Brotherhood,\\" Abbott told reporters in Canberra. \\"The point I made was that in the long run, a free and vigorous media are good for democracy, good for security, (and) good for stability,\\" he said. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The verdicts were \\"feared but expected\\" by relatives, reports Christian Fraser Three al-Jazeera journalists accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood have been jailed for seven years in Egypt. A court in Cairo convicted Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed of spreading false news and supporting the now banned Islamist group. The trio had denied the charges. Eleven defendants tried in absentia, including three foreign journalists, received 10-year sentences. The trial has caused an international outcry amid claims it was politicised. Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told reporters on Monday she was \\"bitterly disappointed\\" by the outcome. Greste, a former BBC journalist, is an Australian citizen. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was \\"completely appalled\\" and the UK Foreign Office has summoned the Egyptian ambassador over the guilty verdicts.

Baher Mohamed was sentenced to a further three years in jail on a separate charge involving possession of \\"unlicensed ammunition\\". Christian Fraser, BBC News, Cairo Peter Greste has spent six months in a 4m (13ft) cell with his two al-Jazeera colleagues, locked down for 23 hours a day with only a small window for light. The Tora prison is a \\"hell hole\\" says Greste's brother, Michael. \\"But he is strong and he will survive.\\" That resilience was on show when the prisoners came into court.

A 'prime number' is a a whole number above 1 that can not be made by multiplying other whole numbers. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: 17729 Student:","completion":"Yes To solve this instance, I started by understanding the definition of a prime number. A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. This means that a prime number can only be divided by 1 and itself without leaving a remainder. To determine if 17729 is a prime number, I needed to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 17729. I used the following method: 1. Start with the lowest possible divisor, 2. 2. Divide 17729 by the current divisor and check if the result is a whole number. 3. If the result is a whole number, then 17729 is not a prime number and the answer is 'No'. 4. If the result is not a whole number, increase the divisor and repeat steps 2-3. 5. Continue this process until the divisor is greater than the square root of 17729, as any divisor larger than the square root will have a corresponding divisor smaller than the square root. By following this method and not finding any divisors other than 1 and 17729, I determined that 17729 is a prime number. Thus, the answer is 'Yes'."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Movie title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news. She is speaking to her office while stopped at traffic lights on red on the Naas Dual Carriageway when a motorcycle with two men on it pulls up beside her.

Her immediate family includes her husband Graham, her young son Cathal, her mother Bernie, and her brother Jimmy. They all deeply mourn her loss, as they had witnessed firsthand the risks associated with her determined investigative journalism and had implored her to stop for the sake of her own safety. Guerin's colleagues at the Sunday Independent also grieve for her, as she was a passionate and dedicated reporter who was committed to unveiling the truth behind the illegal drug trade plaguing Dublin's working-class citizens. Her death is not only a personal loss for those who knew her well, but it also highlights the severe threats and real-life consequences that journalists can face in the line of duty. Additionally, the public mourns Guerin's tragic and untimely death, as she had become a symbol of perseverance in the face of adversity. Her fearless confrontation of criminal elements in pursuit of the truth demonstrated how one person's actions can have a significant impact on society. Her death sparked outrage in the community and led to changes in Ireland's legislation, making her a martyr and an inspiration for other journalists and citizens committed to raising awareness about and combating organized crime. In summary, Guerin is mourned by a wide range of people, including her family, friends, colleagues, and the public at large.

Write an article using the following points: More than 50 university courses across UK awarded students a First or 2:1. Number achieving 2:1 or above has leapt over five years at some institutions. Critics say grades have been pushed up as a 'marketing ploy' Universities said the rises reflected improvements in A-level grades. Article:","completion":"Title: The Rise in University Grades: A Reflection of Higher Education's Success or a Marketing Ploy? Introduction: Over the past five years, more than 50 university courses across the UK have seen a significant increase in the number of students being awarded a First or 2:1. This dramatic leap has caught the attention of both the academic community and critics alike, leading to debates on whether this rise is indicative of improvements in A-level grades or simply a marketing strategy used by universities to attract more students. Body: To give a clearer picture, it is important to understand what a First and a 2:1 degree classification entails in the UK educational system. A First is the highest degree classification awarded, generally equivalent to a GPA of 3.7 or above in the US. A 2:1 degree, on the other hand, is slightly lower but still considered an upper second class honours, similar to a GPA between 3.0 and 3.7. According to recent data, the number of students achieving a 2:1 or above has dramatically increased at some institutions over the past five years, sparking concerns among experts about grade inflation. Critics argue that universities have been pushing up grades as a 'marketing ploy' to improve their reputation and rankings, thus attracting more prospective students and increasing enrollment numbers. However, many universities maintain that the observed rise in First and 2:1 awards is a reflection of improvements in A-level grades. They argue that the students entering universities today are better prepared academically and therefore, more likely to achieve higher degree classifications than their predecessors. This explanation is backed by the fact that over the past few years, A-level results have been consistently improving, with more students achieving higher grades and securing their places in top universities. The debate between the merit-based and marketing-driven explanations highlights essential questions regarding the state of the UK's higher education system. On one hand, the academic community acknowledges the importance of providing equal opportunities for students from all backgrounds. If the increase in degree classifications is attributed to improvements in A-level grades, it could be seen as a positive indication that students across the UK are benefiting from a stronger education system and better support at school. On the other hand, if the rise is indeed a byproduct of a university marketing ploy, it could have far-reaching consequences. Grade inflation may cause employers to have less trust in degree classifications, potentially devaluing the worth of university degrees altogether. Moreover, those students who genuinely worked hard and achieved high grades might feel undermined, as the raised degree classifications obscure their individual achievements. Conclusion: The ongoing debate about the rise in First and 2:1 degree classifications across UK universities highlights the complex interplay between academic excellence and marketing strategies. It is essential to continue monitoring trends in A-level performance and university degree classifications to ensure that UK higher education remains credible and valuable for students as they embark on their professional journeys. As stakeholders, universities, the government, and employers must work together to maintain a fair and accurate system that rewards genuine achievement and fosters a well-educated workforce for the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: The Jets quickly drove downfield on their first possession, scoring their first touchdown in the first quarter all season. Chad Pennington found Jerricho Cotchery on a 28-yard completion and rookie running back Leon Washington picked up 23 yards on a sweep around end before Washington scored on a 5-yard touchdown run. On the Jets' next possession, Pennington fired a 44-yard touchdown pass to Justin McCareins, his first touchdown of the season, to open up a 14-0 lead. The Lions would get on the board early in the second quarter as Jon Kitna had big completions to Dan Campbell, Mike Furrey, and Roy Williams, the pass to Williams a 22-yard touchdown. But on the kickoff, Justin Miller returned the ball 56 yards inside Detroit territory, and after a pass from Pennington to Cotchery, Kevan Barlow scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. Kitna would get intercepted by Kerry Rhodes on the next possession, but Pennington would then get picked off by Terrence Holt at the Detroit 2-yard line to short-circuit a possible score. The Jets led 21-7 at halftime. Kitna would again get intercepted on the first possession of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma. But the drive went nowhere, and Detroit's next one, a 12-play, 83-yard drive, resulted in a 25-yard field goal by Jason Hanson. The Jets got that right back, as Pennington converted a couple of third downs during a drive that was capped by Mike Nugent's 33-yard field goal. Down fourteen points, Detroit halved New York's lead with Kitna finding Kevin Jones on a 9-yard touchdown pass on a drive where Kitna converted a critical 4th-and-11 pass to Mike Furrey. The Jets would come right back, with Washington scoring on a 16-yard touchdown run on a sweep around end. Detroit would not give up, as Kitna found Furrey on an 18-yard touchdown pass on a play that survived a Jets challenge. On that drive, Kitna again converted a fourth down to Furrey.

Fonda and the young music icon discussed various topics during their time together, including the idea of immortality and legacy. Jackson, who was already making a significant impact on the music industry at the time, spoke passionately about his desire to continue creating art that would resonate with people long after his physical presence was gone. Fonda listened intently as Jackson shared his dreams and aspirations, noting that the singer's determination and conviction were truly admirable. She could see that beneath his gentle exterior, there was a burning desire for greatness and a deep understanding of the power he held as an influential artist. As they explored the ranch together, Fonda noticed how taken Jackson was with the natural beauty of the Santa Barbara landscape. The rolling hills, magnificent oak trees, and peaceful tranquility of the area seemed to have a profound impact on him – so much so, that he would later acquire the property that came to be known as Neverland Ranch. The ranch would become Jackson's sanctuary, where he could escape the pressures of fame and focus on his artistic vision, as well as provide a place for children from all around the world to experience the magic and wonder that defined his own childhood dreams. Years later, when reflecting on their time together on her ranch, Fonda couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in knowing that she played a small role in inspiring Jackson to find his personal haven. Although the King of Pop's life was not without its share of controversy and tragedy, Fonda remembered him as the passionate, optimistic young artist she had introduced to the beautiful world of Santa Barbara. Throughout his life, even in the face of adversity, Jackson continued to insist that he would never truly die – and in many ways, he was right. His music and influence continue to be felt today and are certain to endure for generations to come.

The archive is maintained by government information specialists and web curators across several UC campuses, the Stanford University Libraries, the California State Library, and the California State Archives. ||||| BERKELEY (CBS SF) — A Berkeley woman loves her new car, but has a big problem with her new randomly generated license plates ending in 666. “I could not believe it,” said Bobbie Larkins, a devout Christian. “It sent a chill through my entire body.” She was so shocked that she drove with the plates inside her car to request new ones at the DMV. “666 is symbolic of the devil or the anti-Christ,” Larkins said. “You know, it’s a satanic number.” A replacement would cost 20, but the DMV later agreed to waive the fee for Larkins. The DMV told KPIX it gets more complaints about 666 than any other random alphabetic-numeric combination. Still, the DMV says it has no intention of taking 666 out of random circulation. Last November, a driver spotted a vulgar Vietnamese phrase on a San Jose license plate and reported it to the DMV. When it comes to personalized license plates, DMV spokesman Jaime Garza said the department gets 500 applications a day from drivers who must explain and justify the meaning of the phrase. Researchers then check it across 150 languages, using special dictionaries, online translators, and even the White House’s drug lingo database, to weed out out drug and gang related terms or hidden sexual references. But when they slip through, the department relies on public complaints. Out of the million personalized license plates on California roads, just two or three are recalled every year. |||||Summary:","completion":"There is an archive that keeps lots of important information from California state agency websites, like news, events and reports.

Answer:","completion":"Title: Terribly Disappointing and Unreliable SMS Sync App! (1/5) As a long-time user of various SMS syncing applications, I have to say that the com.zegoggles.smssync app is by far the worst I have ever experienced. I have used this app for about a month, and my experience was consistently terrible. I have never written a review like this before, but I couldn’t help but express my disappointment with this app. First and foremost, the user interface of this app is extremely outdated and confusing. I had to struggle for nearly an hour just to find essential settings and features. The navigation within the app is very counterintuitive, and the app itself is simply not user-friendly. Despite having an elaborate interface, important information is not easy to find, and the app is often slow in responding to touch inputs. The app claims that it allows you to easily back up your SMS to various platforms like Gmail and Google Drive, but the process of setting up the backup is so complicated and frustrating that I ended up feeling discouraged. Even though I managed to connect the app with my Google Drive account eventually, I faced multiple issues while attempting synchronization. The primary reason I downloaded the app was to ensure that my text messages were securely backed up and accessible from other devices. However, the app failed miserably in this department. I had constant issues with syncing, and the app would often display error messages that I did not understand. Moreover, some of my important messages went missing while I was trying to transfer my SMS history. To add insult to injury, when I reached out to customer service, they were unresponsive and unhelpful. In addition to the syncing issues, the lack of reliable security features in the app is deeply concerning. There is no option for two-factor authentication, and the app did not ask for any permissions from me when connecting to my Gmail account. Furthermore, there is no clear privacy policy or terms of service, making it impossible to trust the app with sensitive data. Lastly, the app has constant stability issues that need to be addressed urgently. It would often crash or freeze on me without any warning. Nothing is more frustrating than losing valuable time attempting to resolve these issues – time that could be better spent on other more important tasks. Given that there are many alternative SMS syncing apps available on the market, I would advise everyone to steer clear of com.zegoggles.smssync. Don't waste your time with this app. With a confusing interface, extremely unreliable synchronization, lackluster security, nonexistent customer support, and pervasive stability issues, this app is not worth the storage space it takes up on your device. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. However, I'll have to settle for giving it an unimpressive 1-star rating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish). Dr. Gorski is envisioned as the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll that her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller (Jon Hamm), who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform the lobotomy. Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\". She then fights three samurai giants. As her fantasy ends, she finds herself back in the brothel, her dance having impressed Blue and other onlookers. Babydoll convinces the four girls to join her in preparing an escape. She plans to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she imagines...

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"? Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

As the Supreme Court gets ready to announce whether President Barack Obama's heath-care reform is constitutional, some Democrats hope it strikes down the law. They believe bad news for ObamaCare is good political news for Mr. Obama. Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that half the voters \\"think the whole thing is political\\" so if the law is overturned, Republicans \\"will own\\" the health-care issue as costs \\"escalate unbelievably.\\" Democrats can profit at the polls by saying, \\"We tried, we did something.\\" But Democrats should be careful what they wish for. ObamaCare is not popular; striking down the law in part or completely is. For example, in the June 5 Fox News poll, only 40% favor the new health-care law while 49% oppose it. Just 30% would prefer the Supreme Court to uphold it, while 21% favor the court striking down the law's individual mandate to buy health insurance at age 26, and 38% want the entire statute declared unconstitutional. A New York Times/CBS News poll earlier this month was even worse for the law, finding that 34% of Americans support ObamaCare (18% strongly) while 48% disapprove (36% strongly).

New research suggests that theropods -- those \\"beast-footed\\" terrestrial carnivores -- had lips and gums that covered most of their teeth, challenging toothy ideas of what they looked like. University of Toronto vertebrate paleontologist Robert Reisz presented the findings Friday at the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's annual meeting (PDF) in Mississauga, Ontario. \\"In popular culture, we imagine dinosaurs as more ferocious-looking, but that is not the case,\\" Reisz said in a news release To test the hypothesis that lips covered theropod dinosaurs' teeth when the mouth was closed, Reisz and colleague Derek Larson examined dental anatomy and modern-day reptilian predators, including crocodiles and monitor lizards. Crocodiles have exposed teeth, much like a \\"Jurassic Park\\" predator, while monitor lizards have teeth concealed behind scaly lips, similar to the movie version of velociraptors, he said. Lips protect teeth enamel from drying out in part by keeping them hydrated, Reisz said. \\"We propose that this requirement of hydration is not possible to maintain if the tooth is exposed permanently,\\" he said. To test their theory they examined tusks, the exposed teeth of terrestrial mammals that don't have enamel, and compared them with the large teeth of theropod dinosaurs, known to have well-preserved enamel. They concluded that theropod teeth \\"were not exposed permanently, but covered by reptilian lips\\" similar to those found on various scaled lizards. Then why do crocodiles, the closer relatives to dinosaurs, have exposed teeth? One might think crocodiles would be the logical choice for comparing teeth, \\"except that they are aquatic, while dinosaurs are mostly terrestrial,\\" Reisz said. In other words, crocodiles spend their time submerged in water and don't need lips for hydration protection. \\"Thus, the comparison is flawed,\\" Reisz said in an email. \\"Their teeth are kept hydrated by an aquatic environment.\\" On the other hand, reptiles with lips, such as monitor lizards, typically live on land where their teeth require different protection. From this, Reisz concludes that dinosaur teeth would likely have been covered by scaly lips. Besides, movie versions of most other dinosaurs, including velociraptors, have teeth covered by scaly lips, Reisz pointed out. While the research is ongoing, he has a theory for why we insist on toothy grins for T-rexes: To match \\"their impressive size.\\" ||||| Can a crocodile’s smile reveal whether dinosaurs had lips? What if lips and gums hid most of dinosaur's teeth? New findings from University of Toronto vertebrate palaeontologist Robert Reisz challenge the idea of what therapods might have looked like when dinosaurs roamed the earth. His research will be presented today at a conference at U of T Mississauga – and it's already making headlines. “When we see dinosaurs in popular culture, such as in the movie Jurassic Park, we see them depicted with big teeth sticking out of their mouths,” Reisz says. Large dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, bare a ferocious grin, while smaller creatures such as velociraptors are shown with scaly lips covering their teeth. The U of T Mississauga expert was curious about which version might be most accurate. “We have very little information about dinosaurs’ soft tissue,” he says. For clues about how therapods might have appeared, he looked to modern-day reptilian predators like crocodiles and monitor lizards. According to Reisz, lipless crocodiles have exposed teeth, much like a Jurassic Park predator, while monitor lizards conceal teeth behind scaly lips that are similar to the movie version of velociraptors. Lips help to protect teeth, in part by helping to enclose them in a moist environment where they won’t dry out, Reisz says. Crocodiles, which spend their time submerged in water, don’t need lips for protection. “Their teeth are kept hydrated by an aquatic environment,” Reisz says. Reptiles with lips, such as monitor lizards, typically live on land (much like their movie counterparts) where their teeth require different protection. From this, Reisz concludes that dinosaur teeth would likely have been covered by scaly lips. “It’s also important to remember that teeth would have been partially covered by gums. If we look at where the enamel stops, we can see that a substantial portion of the teeth would be hidden in the gums. The teeth would have appeared much smaller on a living animal. “In popular culture, we imagine dinosaurs as more ferocious-looking, but that is not the case.” (Below: Gorgosaurus using its specialized teeth for feeding on a young Corythosaurus/image credit: Danielle Default) Reisz presents his findings on May 20 at the annual meeting of the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Palaeontolgy at UTM. The two-day conference, which began on May 19, brings together 60 Canadian researchers working in Canada and around the globe. “Canada has some very significant locations for understanding vertebrate evolution, ranging from the late Cretaceous in Alberta to the Pleistocene in the Arctic and the early stages of terrestrial vertebrate evolution in the Atlantic region,” says Reisz, who helped to organized the conference. “There are about 1,000 people worldwide who study vertebrate fossils. It’s important to come together and exchange ideas and unite a community that is so widespread geographically.” The conference features presentations on the latest research in palaeontology, including a crocodile-like creature from Sudan discovered by U of T researcher David Evans; a talk on the evolution of how birds hear; what a recently discovered ceratops from Montana tells us about horned dinosaurs; and deciphering the social behaviour of oviraptorsaurs found in Mongolia. ||||| New research takes aim at the fanged portrayal of the T rex, suggesting enamel on its teeth was probably kept moist by thin, scaly lips much like those of lizards Its image is one of a fierce predator who towered over most others, baring dozens of jagged, bone-crushing teeth. But new research out of Toronto seeks to challenge depictions of the Tyrannosaurus rex, suggesting that its fearsome incisors might have been hidden behind a pair of lips. “In popular culture, we imagine dinosaurs as more ferocious-looking, but that is not the case,” said Robert Reisz of the University of Toronto. In research presented Friday at a conference of the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, he takes aim at the fanged portrayal of the T rex, suggesting its teeth did not stick out when its mouth was closed. The truth of the tyrannosaurus - podcast Read more The theory is based on the layer of thin enamel that covered the teeth of the T rex and fellow theropods. Reisz turned to modern-day reptiles to see how they keep this fragile enamel hydrated and protect their teeth from rotting. “If you have your teeth sticking out, you can’t hydrate the enamel. You can’t maintain it properly.” Crocodiles get around this by spending time in water while monitor lizards have lips to protect the enamel on their teeth. Given that the T rex lived on land, the enamel on its teeth was probably kept moist by thin, scaly lips much like those of lizards. “People have a hard time wrapping their mind around the idea of teeth that are in excess of 10-15cm still being in the mouth,” Reisz said. “But it’s all a matter of some big-headed animals.” The research is ongoing, but Reisz said most so far had welcomed the theory. He expected it to stir up some controversy among those responsible for depicting how dinosaurs might have looked millions of years ago, however. The idea of lips on the T rex is not as far-fetched as it sounds, he said. Small theropods such as velociraptors are already often depicted with lips. It’s just the larger theropods, such as the T rex, who are almost always shown with their teeth exposed. Still, he acknowledged that the theory might come as a blow to the dinosaur’s fierce image. “Maybe to children and a general audience they might look less ferocious without their teeth sticking out. But they are still big, impressive animals that were the top predators of their time.” ||||| Meat-eating dinosaurs' teeth were long thought to stick out of their mouths like a crocodile's — but that might not have been the case. T. rex may have had lips. Yes, you read that right. Lips. Robert Reisz, a paleontologist at the University of Toronto, is challenging the long-standing image of meat-eating theropod dinosaurs such as T. rex. Specifically, Reisz suggests that theropods' teeth were not bared all the time, extending outside their mouths and fully visible whether their jaws were open or closed. Rather, these teeth were kept hidden, covered by scaly lips, he said in a presentation May 20 at the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology's annual meeting in Ontario. [Gory Guts: Photos of a T. Rex Autopsy] Reisz told Live Science in an email that he had always been bothered by the typical \\"permanent smile\\" portrayal of theropod dinosaur teeth. He first looked to the closest living relatives of theropod dinosaurs — crocodiles — for clues about tooth exposure. At first glance, it could seem like the expectation for large theropods to have exposed teeth was on the right track. Crocodiles' teeth are covered by gums for about one-quarter of their length, but lips are absent and the tooth crowns are permanently exposed, Reisz explained. However, if you look closer at tooth structure, a different story might emerge, he noted in his presentation. The hard enamel of animals' teeth has low water content, and is typically kept hydrated by saliva. Without lips to keep moisture in and prevent the teeth from drying out, the tough enamel would become brittle and more prone to damage and wear, Reisz told Live Science. Crocodiles live in watery environments and would rely on their habitat to keep exposed teeth hydrated. But land-dwelling theropods' large teeth — which are known to have enamel — could have been compromised by perpetual exposure, and likely needed to be covered by lips in order to stay moist, Reisz said in the presentation. But crocodiles aren't the only animals with exposed teeth — elephants, for instance, have exposed teeth as well, and many extinct saber-toothed predators had very long canines that were also exposed when their mouths were closed. Wouldn't their teeth have been vulnerable to serious drying out, too? Not necessarily. A mammal's tooth structure is actually quite different from a reptile's, said Zhijie Jack Tseng, a paleontologist who studies bite-force biomechanics in extinct carnivores at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. \\"Mammalian teeth are prismatic — they have a crisscrossing structure,\\" Tseng told Live Science. He explained that when mammal teeth grow, the enamel emerges from the root area and \\"races outward in all directions,\\" creating a 3D shape that may be better at keeping water inside. In reptile teeth, the enamel grows in one direction, creating a different type of structure that may not retain water as effectively — potentially making their teeth more likely to chip or crack, Tseng suggested. But for reptiles — and theropod dinosaurs — damaging or losing a tooth simply isn't as big a deal as it would be for a mammal, Tseng added. Mammals typically grow a set of baby teeth followed by a set of adult teeth, whereas reptiles — and likely many, if not all, dinosaurs — replace individual teeth throughout their lifetimes, scientists have found. \\"Each tooth — relatively speaking — doesn't have as much value to the animal as in mammals,\\" Tseng said. \\"T. rex could chip a tooth or get one stuck in prey, and just replace it. Evolving protection for teeth is not a critical component of how they eat.\\" Reisz suggested in a statement that people may be reluctant to abandon the terrifying but familiar image of a \\"ferocious-looking\\" T. rex with bared teeth. But now more than ever, scientists are challenging traditional ideas about how dinosaurs may have looked and behaved. New fossil evidence, computer modeling and comparisons with living creatures are helping scientists to paint a clearer picture of these extinct animals, overturning many historic conceptions of their postures, gaits, skin coverings and colors. Long gone are the days when dinosaurs were almost uniformly pictured as grayish-green, ponderous reptiles with scaly skin. Contrary to their portrayal in popular films, dinosaurs are now widely accepted by scientists as having been covered in feathers, possibly in a range of colors, much like the colorful plumage of modern birds, which are a living dinosaur lineage. Is it really so far-fetched to suggest that T. rex's toothy grin should also be relegated to the past? Time — and further research — will tell, Reisz said. Original article on Live Science. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Scientists have recently discovered that the Tyrannosaurus rex, a big dinosaur, might not have had his big sharp teeth showing all the time, like we see in movies. Instead, they found that dinosaurs may have had scaly lips that covered their teeth, just like some reptiles that live today. This is because if their teeth were always sticking out, it would be hard to keep them clean and strong. By having lips, their teeth would be much healthier. So, even though they might not look as scary as we thought, dinosaurs were still amazing creatures!"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps.

In 1998,on a three-week vacation journey in Nepal,Wood met a local headmaster who invited him to visit his school in a far mountain village.The experience changed Wood's life. \\"This headmaster had 450 students at the school,but he didn't have any books,\\" Wood said.\\"He had a library that was empty.\\" Wood promised to fill the library shelves and returned to the village one year later with some of his friends with 3000 books.And that was just the start.Later,Wood used some of his personal money to start Room to Read. He believes that world change begins with educated children.Today,the programme can be found in10 countries across Asia and Africa. Wood believes the key to the program's success is local support.While Room to Read gives away money and provides books,communities offer land and parents help build the school.Agnes,a Room to Read teacher in Zambia who also runs the library,is proud to say the literacy' at her school has improved. Room to Read's biggest challenge is the huge need. Hundreds of communities have asked for literacy prograrnmes.One way of Room to Read's success is that it will achieve Wood's goal of reaching 10 million kids by 2015,five years earlier than it is planned.

Read this and answer the question The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of science in a social context, starting from Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962. It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science. As Thomas Kuhn put it, the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms, such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual, cultural, economic and political themes outside of science. \\"Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific.\\" What idea did social science add to science as a whole?","completion":"The idea that social science added to the field of science as a whole is the recognition of the significant influence of sociological, intellectual, cultural, economic, and political factors on the development and evolution of scientific knowledge. This perspective broadened the understanding of scientific progress beyond a solely positivist approach, which focused on the empirical and logical aspects of science. By introducing the concept of competing paradigms and emphasizing the historical context and human interactions involved in scientific endeavors, Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions underscored the role of the wider social environment in shaping scientific perspectives, theories, and methods. This idea shifted the study of science towards a more interdisciplinary approach, taking into account the various forces impacting scientific development and inviting researchers from diverse fields to contribute to the understanding of science in a broader socio-historical context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Just as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development. Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider. Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\"\\", answer the following question.

It also reflects commitment and honor, two important elements of chivalry. For example, simple texts like “Hey, just wanted to tell you good morning” or “Good morning! I’ll be thinking of you today” can really brighten your partner’s day. If there’s someone behind you, help them by holding the door regardless of their gender or whether you know them. This kind of common courtesy is an important part of chivalry. For example, if you see someone coming in behind you with their arms full, you should hold the door for them. You should also hold the door for your partner, but only if they’re comfortable with it. Some people like to open the door for themselves as a sign of independence. This is another chivalrous action previously reserved just for women. However, you should apply this kindness to anyone who isn’t as physically fit and may need a seat, such as a pregnant, ill, or elderly person. For example, if you’re sitting on the bus and you see an elderly woman standing up, you could say, “Excuse me, ma’am, would you like this seat?” and offer her your spot. If you see someone being mistreated or bullied, chivalry means stepping in and helping the victim. Stepping in can be difficult to do in the moment, but standing up for others can also be as simple as asking the victim if they need any help or calling for help from a law enforcement official or another bystander. Standing up for others shows chivalrous qualities such as bravery, honor, and loyalty to your principles. For example, if you see someone being harassed on the subway or the street, you could step in and ask the victim if they need any help. This takes the attention away from the harasser and gives the victim some control over the situation. If you don’t feel comfortable intervening or the situation seems risky, you can also approach the victim afterwards and ask them if they need help. Whether you’re interacting with a family member, a significant other, or a stranger, being respectful is an essential part of chivalry. You can show respect through being polite, listening carefully, and valuing others’ opinions. For example, always be respectful to waitstaff at restaurants. When they bring you your food or refill your water glass, remember to say thank you instead of just ignoring the action. If your significant other is telling you about their day, you can show them respect by listening attentively and asking questions to show them that you’re interested.","completion":"This article emphasizes the importance of chivalry through acts of kindness, courtesy, respect, and standing up for others, showcasing commitment, honor, and politeness in various situations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Central banks: Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, manage their respective country's monetary policy and can create new high-powered money, as explained in the initial description. They also have the authority to buy and sell government securities, which influences the amount of money circulating in the economy. 2.

After the untimely death of a small-town church choir director in Pacashau, Georgia, Vi Rose Hill, a no-nonsense mother raising two teens alone, takes control of the choir using the traditional Gospel style that their Pastor Dale approves of. However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow, the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur \\"Joyful Noise\\" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at the same time as the town needs the choir's inspiring music more than ever. Vi Rose has a son, Walter, who has Asperger syndrome, and a talented, pretty and ready-to-date daughter, Olivia. But Olivia is not ready to date under her mother's household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy. A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny. At Randy's urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements (prepared by Randy) would be more successful for the choir. It also turns out that the choir has a chance at the national finals of the competition when the rival choir is found to have cheated by hiring professionals. But the pastor says that the church will not sponsor the choir unless they continue to use their reverent, traditional style.

Æthelred became the ruler of English Mercia after the death of its last king, Ceolwulf II, in 879. His rule was confined to the western half of Mercia, as the eastern half was then part of the Viking-ruled Danelaw. 2. His ancestry is unknown, making it difficult to trace his lineage and familial connections. 3. Æthelred was likely the leader of an unsuccessful Mercian invasion of Wales in 881. After this defeat, he acknowledged the lordship of King Alfred the Great of Wessex, forming an alliance with him. 4. The alliance with King Alfred was cemented through the marriage of Æthelred to Alfred's daughter, Æthelflæd. 5. In 886, Alfred took possession of London, which had traditionally been a Mercian town. He then handed control of the city to Æthelred. 6. In 892, the Vikings renewed their attacks, and Æthelred led a combined army of Mercians, West Saxons, and Welsh to victory over a Viking army at the Battle of Buttington. 7. Over the next three years, Æthelred fought alongside Alfred's son, the future King Edward the Elder, against the Vikings. 8. It is believed that during the decade 899 to 909, Æthelred's health may have declined, and Æthelflæd may have assumed the role of the effective ruler of Mercia. 9. After Æthelred's death in 911, Æthelflæd ruled as Lady of the Mercians until her own death in 918. 10. The couple had only one child, a daughter named Ælfwynn, who briefly ruled as Lady of the Mercians after Æthelflæd's death until she was deposed by her uncle, King Edward. In summary, Æthelred was the ruler of western Mercia after King Ceolwulf II's death and formed a significant alliance with King Alfred the Great through his marriage to Æthelflæd. He fought battles against the Vikings and later handed over control of western Mercia to his wife Æthelflæd due to his declining health. After his death, Æthelflæd and their daughter Ælfwynn ruled as leaders of Mercia until King Edward eventually took control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

At two stories, the building is tall in its proportion and incorporates elements from both early American and Victorian styles, which were common in academic buildings built during this period.Architectural historian S. Allen Chambers described Literary Hall as an anomaly because the basic design and fenestration patterns, which invoke early Federal and Greek Revival design elements, are adorned with details more characteristic of the Victorian era.According to architectural historian Michael J. Pauley of the West Virginia Department of Culture and History's Historic Preservation Unit, Literary Hall's unique structural features make the building \\"one of Romney's and Hampshire County's most notable landmarks, and one in which this community is justifiably proud\\". Pauley further averred that the building is \\"highly representative of the development of education and literature in the early United States\\". In describing its impact on Romney's streetscape, Chambers described Literary Hall as \\"adding distinction to Romney's major street intersection\\". Chambers also noted the building's resemblance and \\"strong architectural kinship\\" to the Romney Presbyterian Church.Literary Hall is a two-story red brick structure, rectangular in plan, and topped with a gable roof.

Rowling, was published on July 16, 2005. This release followed the publication of the fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which had been released in 2003. The book's publication was highly anticipated, with bookstores organizing special events and midnight openings to accommodate eager fans waiting to get their hands on a copy of the new installment. The initial print run consisted of a massive 10.8 million copies, setting a then-record for the largest first printing in publishing history. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, readers follow the adventures of Harry, Hermione, and Ron during their sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The novel delves deeper into the world of magic, with significant emphasis on relationships, both platonic and romantic, among the young characters. The book also explores the backstory of Lord Voldemort (Tom Riddle), the primary antagonist of the series, providing essential insights into his rise to power and his eventual demise. A pivotal event in the book is the death of the beloved character Albus Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts. This event marks a turning point in the series, as it sets the stage for the ultimate battle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort in the final installment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince received widespread acclaim from critics and readers and quickly became a commercial success. In the United States alone, it sold approximately 6.9 million copies within its first 24 hours, breaking previous records held by earlier installments of the Harry Potter series. The novel eventually won multiple awards, including the 2006 British Book Award for Children's Book of the Year. Additionally, it was adapted into a successful film, which premiered in 2009, solidifying its impact on the global audience and further contributing to the popularity and cultural phenomenon that is the Harry Potter series."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The U.S. president will then address the media before flying out late Tuesday Singapore time. Previous reports had suggested Trump would leave on Wednesday. On the eve of the first encounter between a sitting U.S. president and a leader of North Korea, American officials are maintaining any resulting agreement must lead to an end of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile threats.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that is helped to his feet? On October 6, 1970, on holiday in Istanbul, Turkey, American college student Billy Hayes straps 2 kg of hashish blocks to his chest. While attempting to board a plane back to the United States with his girlfriend, Billy is arrested by Turkish police on high alert for fear of terrorist attacks. He is strip-searched, photographed, and questioned. After a while, a shadowy American, who is never named but is nicknamed \\"Tex\\" by Billy for his thick Texan accent, arrives, takes Billy to a police station, and translates Billy's English for one of the detectives. Billy says that he bought the hashish from a taxicab driver and offers to help the police track him down in exchange for his release. Billy goes with the police to a nearby market and points out the cab driver, but when they go to arrest the cabbie, it becomes apparent that the police have no intention of keeping their end of the deal with Billy. He sees an opportunity and makes a run for it, only to get cornered and recaptured by the mysterious American. During his first night in holding at a local jail, a freezing-cold Billy sneaks out of his cell and steals a blanket. Later that night, he is rousted from his cell and brutally beaten by chief guard Hamidou for the theft. He wakes a few days later in Sağmalcılar Prison, surrounded by fellow Western prisoners Jimmy (an American who is in for stealing two candlesticks from a mosque), Max (an English heroin addict), and Erich (a Swede, also in for drug smuggling), who help him to his feet.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the real name of the person who honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers? In 2001, M.I.A. (Mathangi \\"Maya\\" Arulpragasam) had worked exclusively in the visual arts. While filming a documentary on Elastica's 2001 tour of the US, she was introduced to the Roland MC-505 sequencer/drum machine by electroclash artist Peaches, whose minimalistic approach to music inspired her. She found Peaches' decision to perform without additional instrumentation to be brave and liberating and felt that it emphasised the artist. Returning to London, she unexpectedly gained access to a 505 owned by her friend, former Elastica singer Justine Frischmann. M.I.A. used the 505 to make demo recordings in her bedroom. She initially planned to work as a producer. To this end, she approached Caribbean girls in clubs to see if they would provide vocals for the songs, but without success. M.I.A. secured a record deal with XL Recordings after Frischmann's manager overheard the demo. M.I.A. began work on the album by composing lyrics and melodies, and she programmed drum beats at home on the drum machine. Having produced rough tracks via trial and error, she honed the finished songs in collaboration with other writer-producers. Through these collaborations, she sought to produce a diverse style and \\"drag [her collaborators] out of their boxes, musically\\".DJ Diplo introduced elements of Brazilian baile funk to \\"Bucky Done Gun\\". Fellow composer-producer Richard X worked on the track \\"Hombre\\", which featured a drum pattern created from the sounds made by toys that M.I.A. had bought in India, augmented with sounds produced by objects such as pens and mobile phones. Steve Mackey and Ross Orton, known professionally as Cavemen, worked on \\"Galang\\", which M.I.A. had initially produced with her 505 and a basic four-track tape recorder. Working with Cavemen in a professional studio, she added a bass line and new vocals to give the song \\"a more analogue sound\\" than was possible with the 505.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the full names of the people whose remains were found on Herald Island? ? Bartlett's decision to deposit stores on the ice ensured that an ice camp, known as \\"Shipwreck Camp\\", was more or less established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided \\"substantial and comfortable houses on which we could rely for shelter for a long time.\\" Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp in the direction of the island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.Amid this activity Mackay and Murray, now joined by the anthropologist Henri Beuchat, played little part in the general life of the camp and expressed their determination to leave it, independently, as soon as possible. Bartlett wanted to wait for the longer daylight hours of February before attempting the march, but was persuaded by McKinlay and Mamen to send a trailbreaking group to set up an advance camp on Wrangel Island. A party of four, led by Karluk's first officer Alexander Anderson and including crew members Charles Barker, John Brady and Edmund Golightly, left Shipwreck Camp on 21 January with instructions from Bartlett to establish their camp at or near Berry Point on the north shore of Wrangel Island. On 4 February Bjarne Mamen, who accompanied the party as a scout, returned to Shipwreck Camp and reported that he had left the group a few miles short of land that was evidently not Wrangel Island, and was probably Herald Island, 38 miles (61 km) from their intended destination.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who was approved as king? Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer.

Sentence 2: HIC does not have to administer any programs. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. In fact, the two sentences convey conflicting information. In Sentence 1, it is stated that HIC is responsible for administering certain programs as well as preventing and detecting fraud and abuse. The sentence establishes two main roles for HIC: administering programs and safeguarding against fraud and abuse. On the other hand, Sentence 2 states that HIC does not have to administer any programs. This contradicts the information provided in Sentence 1, which specifies that administering programs is one of HIC's responsibilities. Entailment in linguistics refers to a situation where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Once you are fully aware of your debt situation, get a clear picture of your finances by creating a budget. This will inform you exactly what your revenues and expenses are and will help you create more savings to reduce debt. List all your sources of income and add them up. Move on to list your necessities. These include essential needs that are due regularly like rent, utilities, car payments, food, communication, and debt repayments. Keep in mind that just because these are essential or fixed expenses does not mean that they cannot be greatly reduced to find savings. List your discretionary expenses. Discretionary expenses are costs that you can change or avoid altogether such as buying new clothing or eating dinner out. The best way to get an idea of these expenses is to look at your bank or credit card statements for a month, and add up all the expenses that are not in your fixed expenses category. If you want better accuracy, take an average over several months and use this figure. Subtract your total expenses from your revenue. This is how much you have left over, or alternatively, how much extra you can afford to pay down to your credit cards. . Try to figure out how to decrease your expenses each month so that you can use more funds to pay down your credit cards. Target primarily variable expenses listed in your budget to find ways to save money. Make meals at home instead of eating out. Make coffee at home instead of buying expensive coffee drinks. Delay expenses that can wait for later, like new clothes. Borrow books, music, and movies from the public library instead of buying them. Do not forget to look into your fixed expenses category as well. Can you move into more affordable housing? Find a roommate? Walk more to spend less on gas? Use a less extravagant plan for your cell phone (perhaps only 1GB of data a month instead of 3GB)? Once you have lowered spending using the above tips, you should be able to free additional money each month. Apply some of that additional income to your credit cards and save some for an emergency. For example, upon creation of your budget you may observe you make 1500 per month, and have 1400 a month in expenses. After implementing the savings tips (for example, you drop down to a cheaper phone plan, stop eating out, and start walking to do basic errands), you manage to find 300 in savings. You now have 400 in additional cash. Perhaps 300 can go to your credit card debt and 100 can go into emergency savings. Don't forget to look at your income too. Are there ways to boost your income? Perhaps you can work more hours, look for a better job, or get a part-time job for ten extra hours a week. Make a list of your balances, interest, and fees every month. Check for unanticipated fees and to make sure your payments have been received and credited to your account.","completion":"Create a budget to understand your income and expenses, reduce discretionary and fixed expenses, and allocate more funds towards paying off credit card debt while saving for emergencies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine the terms with the variable w on the right-hand side of the equation. -54w = -55w + 10w - 99 -54w = (-55 + 10)w - 99 -54w = -45w - 99 2. Now, isolate the variable w by moving all w terms to one side of the equation and the constant terms to the other side. To do that, we add 45w to both sides of the equation. -54w + 45w = -45w + 45w - 99 -9w = -99 3.

Information: - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age. - Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (6 March 1475 18 February 1564) was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci. - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An architect is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings. To \\"practice architecture\\" means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use. Etymologically, \\"architect\\" derives from the Latin \\"architectus\\", which derives from the Greek \\" (\\"arkhi-\\", chief + \\"tekton\\", builder), i.e., chief builder. - Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 14522 May 1519), more commonly Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian polymath whose areas of interest included invention, painting, sculpting, architecture, science, music, mathematics, engineering, literature, anatomy, geology, astronomy, botany, writing, history, and cartography. He has been variously called the father of palaeontology, ichnology, and architecture, and is widely considered one of the greatest painters of all time. Sometimes credited with the inventions of the parachute, helicopter and tank, he epitomised the Renaissance humanist ideal. - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages. - The Portrait of a Cardinal is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael . It is housed in the Prado Museum in Madrid . The Cardinal has been identified as either Alidosi , Bibbiena , Cybo or Trivulzio , in the court of Pope Julius II. Painted in Rome , Rafael mastered the art of realism in his paintings , the ability to \`\` paint people as more real than they really are , '' as his peers put it . Like Leonardo da Vinci 's Mona Lisa , the subject is seated , with formation of a triangle pyramid by the subjects ' body and arms . The contrasts are striking between the red of his hat , whiteness of his sleeve and his face . Meticulous brushstrokes give the audience a three - dimensional character , revealing Rapahel 's interest in sculpture during those years . The painting was acquired by Carlos IV of Spain ( 1748 -- 1819 ) in Rome , while the latter was still a prince . The picture was attributed to Antonio Moro , due to its technique , considered unusual in Raphael . - In art history, High Renaissance is the period denoting the apogee of the visual arts in the Italian Renaissance. The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s, with Leonardo's fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence, and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V. This term was first used in German (Hochrenaissance) in the early nineteenth century, and has its origins in the \\"High Style\\" of painting and sculpture described by Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Over the last twenty years, use of the term has been frequently criticized by academic art historians for oversimplifying artistic developments, ignoring historical context, and focusing only on a few iconic works. - Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (March 28 or April 6, 1483April 6, 1520), known as Raphael, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period. - Urbino is a walled city in the Marche region of Italy, south-west of Pesaro, a World Heritage Site notable for a remarkable historical legacy of independent Renaissance culture, especially under the patronage of Federico da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino from 1444 to 1482. The town, nestled on a high sloping hillside, retains much of its picturesque medieval aspect, an illusion only slightly broken by the large car parks below the town.

Use all the basic cleaners, such as soap and water for the body and window cleaner for your windows. Can we draw the following conclusion? A vehicle can be cleaned before waxing.","completion":"Yes, based on the provided information, we can draw the conclusion that a vehicle should be cleaned before waxing. Thoroughly cleaning the car is essential before applying the turtle wax in order to achieve optimal results. Cleaning not only helps in the performance of the wax but also helps in maintaining the vehicle's appearance and longevity. Let's take a deeper dive into this process of properly using turtle wax on a car. To ensure a long-lasting shine, it's important to follow a series of steps when using turtle wax to give your car that sparkling clean effect: 1. Gather your supplies: What you'll need to clean and wax your car are car wash soap, water, a bucket, a hose or water source, window cleaner, microfiber towels, car waxes (such as Turtle Wax), and a sponge or applicator pad for applying the wax. 2. Car cleaning: a) Begin by rinsing your vehicle with water to remove any loose debris. b) Fill the bucket with the car wash soap and water. Ensure to follow the soap manufacturer's instructions on the proportions. c) Use a microfiber wash mitt to gently scrub your car in sections, starting from the top and working your way down. d) After scrubbing each section, rinse away soap with water immediately to avoid soap residue. e) Make sure to clean the wheels and tires with a separate mitt, sponge, or brush dedicated to that purpose. f) Rinse the entire vehicle once more, and use a microfiber towel to dry it. Do not let the car air dry, as this can lead to water spots. 3. Window cleaning: Properly clean windows and windshield with glass cleaner to avoid streaks and to remove any water spots or dirt. 4. Applying the Turtle Wax: a) Ensure the car is completely dry and parked in a shady area before proceeding with wax application. b) Dip a clean sponge or applicator pad into the Turtle Wax. Use small amounts of wax to avoid clumps. c) Divide your car into sections and, using the sponge or pad, apply the wax in a circular motion one section at a time. Work from the roof downwards, and make sure to evenly cover the entire surface. d) Allow the wax to dry until it appears hazy. Turtle Wax usually takes approximately 5-10 minutes to dry, but this can depend on factors such as temperature and humidity. e) After the wax is hazy, use a clean, dry microfiber towel to gently buff the wax from the surface of the car. Use circular motions and continue to buff until the wax residue is gone and a shiny finish is achieved. 5. Visual inspection: Inspect the car carefully and check if the finish is smooth, consistent, and shiny. If required, repeat the waxing process on areas where the finish is not satisfactory. Following these steps will help you achieve a thorough cleaning of your vehicle and a long-lasting shine using Turtle Wax. This process not only enhances your car's appearance but also helps to protect the paint job from various environmental factors that can damage it over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: If you have a puppy, it's fairly easy to determine its age by examining its teeth. Teeth start developing during a puppy's first year. The stage of teeth development is tied to a puppy's approximate age. At one month old, teeth will have just started pushing through the gums. At two months, a puppy will have a full set of deciduous (baby) teeth near the front of the mouth. At four months, adult canines and incisors will start to come in. By seven months, a puppy will have a full set of adult teeth and will have developed molars in the back of the mouth. When a puppy reaches a year old, you should notice ridges or bumps on both the lower and upper top front teeth. Keep in mind that teeth tend to erupt later in toy dog breeds. As a dog ages, their teeth change. Changes in teeth can help you assess a dog's approximate age. Ridges on the incisors change as a dog ages. By the time the dog is three years old, the ridges will have worn off the bottom incisors. By five years old, the ridges will have worn off the upper incisors as well. A small amount of ridges on the upper front four teeth indicate your dog is between three and four. By seven, a dog's teeth are completely smooth. Older dogs tend to be less energetic than younger dogs. Senior dogs often have small benign lumps on the body. They will also be less interested in playing than younger dogs. They are generally less muscular than younger dogs. Cloudy eyes are a sign of natural hardening of the lens as the dog ages, and this is called lenticular sclerosis. If your dog shows other signs of aging, such as smooth teeth and low energy, lenticular sclerosis can help you confirm your dog is older than seven. Lenticular sclerosis and cataracts are not the same thing. Cataracts are white and opaque and they are also common in senior dogs. However, some dogs develop cataracts young due to genetic reasons. Cataracts will affect your dog's vision, whereas lenticular sclerosis will not. Fur color often changes as a dog ages. However, fur color is not the best means of determining age. However, when taken into account with other factors like teeth, fur may help determine a dog's age. Most dogs have some graying fur past the age of five. Graying hair is typically found around the muzzle. Some dogs gray as early as two, depending on their environment and genetic makeup. Fur color can help confirm a dog is older when taken into consideration alongside other factors, like teeth and activity level. It should not be used as the sole means to determine a dog's age. Larger breeds tend to have shorter lifespans. They may show signs of aging younger than smaller dogs. Great Danes, for example, typically live around seven years while Chihuahuas often live well into their teens. A bigger dog may show signs of aging early. In general, you can assume a big dog showing significant signs of aging is around seven or eight while a small dog can be assumed to be ages 10 or up.","completion":"This article discusses the various ways to determine a dog's age, primarily looking at the development and changes in their teeth, signs of aging in behavior, eyesight, fur color, and further considering the breed's size and lifespan factors. One of the main indicators of a puppy's age is the development of its teeth. Teeth begin to emerge through the gums at about one month old. By two months, a puppy has a full set of baby teeth near the mouth's front. As the puppy develops to four months, adult canines and incisors begin to appear, and by seven months, a full set of adult teeth will have emerged, including molars. At about a year old, puppies develop ridges or bumps on the upper and lower front teeth. However, it's noted that teeth development can vary, with toy dog breeds often having later teeth eruption. As a dog ages, the teeth transform, providing clues about the dog's age. From three years, the ridges on the lower incisors begin to wear off, and by the fifth year, the upper incisor ridges do the same. When a dog turns seven, its teeth usually become completely smooth. The dog's behavior, physical appearance, and eyesight changes can also indicate its age. Senior dogs, for example, usually have reduced energy levels, show less interest in playing, have less muscle mass, and may have small benign body lumps. Eye changes that involve a natural lens hardening process, known as lenticular sclerosis, can signify a dog's age beyond seven. Lenticular sclerosis, which leaves the eyes cloudy, is distinguished from cataracts, which cause opacity, with the latter affecting vision and often occurring in older dogs due to age and genetic factors. The dogs’ fur color could change with age but is not the most reliable indicator of age. However, when considered with other factors like teeth conditions and activity levels, it becomes supportive evidence in age determination. Most dogs start to gray around the muzzle after turning five, although some may gray earlier due to environmental conditions or genetic predispositions. Finally, the dog's breed and size play significant roles in aging. Larger breeds tend to experience shorter life spans and show aging signs earlier compared to smaller breeds. Great Danes, for instance, average a lifespan of seven years, whereas Chihuahuas usually live into their teens. Therefore, a bigger dog showing significant aging signs may likely be around seven or eight, while a small dog with similar aging indications may be around ten or older. However, these should also be considered alongside other mentioned aging indicators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: After the rise of Young Turks to power through their 1908 revolution, they began imposing a more centralized system of rule across the Ottoman Empire. This meant to put an end to local particularism, which was seen first in the violent suppression of the Hauran Druze Rebellion in Syria in 1909. During the Syrian rebellion, the Ottomans succeeded in suppressing the Jabal Druze revolt after conquering the villages, forcibly registering villagers and disarming them, collecting taxes in cash or cattle, and conscripting 1000 men into the Ottoman army. Ottoman governor Sami Pasha al-Faruqi wanted to apply same measures in Transjordan: villages in Ajlun were encircled by 400 Ottoman soldiers who disarmed the villagers and took 85 conscripts. Governmental troops in Al-Salt and Madaba issued identity papers as a prelude to conscription. Sami Pasha sent a telegram on 6 November 1910 from Jabal Druze to the Al-Karak Mutasarrıf Muhemet Tahir Pasha, requesting that the residents of the town demonstrate their loyalty to the Empire by ceding their weapons and submitting to personal registration. This was seen differently by the local population; measures of disarmament and conscription. The Mutasarrıf conveyed the message to the residents, who responded by requesting that they be allowed to keep their weapons for protection against Bedouin raiders. Sami Pasha assured them that the state would only conduct registration of people and lands but sent a large number of troops into the area, undermining his credibility. Question: How many years after the revolution did the Hauran Druze rebellion take place? Answer:","completion":"The Young Turks came to power through their 1908 revolution. The Hauran Druze Rebellion took place in 1909. To calculate the difference in years: 1909 (year of the Hauran Druze Rebellion) - 1908 (year of the Young Turks Revolution) = 1 year So, the Hauran Druze Rebellion took place 1 year after the Young Turks revolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said. Benjamin, 53, of Jersey City had been collecting Social Security disability after undergoing double bypass surgery when the checks stopped coming.

Context: Hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos). The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos).

I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Which entity is this text about? Thor Heyerdahl (Norwegian pronunciation: [tu:r 'haei@da:l]; October 6, 1914 - April 18, 2002) was a Norwegian adventurer and ethnographer with a background in zoology, botany, and geography. He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition in 1947, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a hand-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between separate cultures. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. In 1947, Heyerdahl and five fellow adventurers sailed from Peru to the Tuamotu Islands, French Polynesia in a pae-pae raft that they had constructed from balsa wood and other native materials, christened the Kon-Tiki. The Kon-Tiki expedition was inspired by old reports and drawings made by the Spanish Conquistadors of Inca rafts, and by native legends and archaeological evidence suggesting contact between South America and Polynesia. The Kon-Tiki smashed into the reef at Raroia in the Tuamotus on August 7, 1947, after a 101-day, 4,300-nautical-mile (5,000-mile or 8,000 km) journey across the Pacific Ocean. Heyerdahl had nearly drowned at least twice in childhood and did not take easily to water; he said later that there were times in each of his raft voyages when he feared for his life. Kon-Tiki demonstrated that it was possible for a primitive raft to sail the Pacific with relative ease and safety, especially to the west (with the trade winds). The raft proved to be highly manoeuvrable, and fish congregated between the nine balsa logs in such numbers that ancient sailors could have possibly relied on fish for hydration in the absence of other sources of fresh water. Other rafts have repeated the voyage, inspired by Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl's book about The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas has been translated into 70 languages. The documentary film of the expedition entitled Kon-Tiki won an Academy Award in 1951. A dramatised version was released in 2012, also called Kon-Tiki, and was nominated for both the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Golden Globe Awards. It was the first time that a Norwegian film was nominated for both an Oscar and a Golden Globe. Anthropologists continue to believe that Polynesia was settled from west to east, based on linguistic, physical, and genetic evidence, migration having begun from the Asian mainland. There are controversial indications, though, of some sort of South American/Polynesian contact, most notably in the fact that the South American sweet potato is served as a dietary staple throughout much of Polynesia. Blood samples taken in 1971 and 2008 from Easter Islanders without any European or other external descent were analysed in a 2011 study, which concluded that the evidence supported some aspects of Heyerdahl's hypothesis. This result has been questioned because of the possibility of contamination by South Americans after European contact with the islands. However, more recent DNA work (after Heyerdahl's death) contradicts the post-European-contact contamination hypothesis, finding the South American DNA sequences to be far older than that. Heyerdahl had attempted to counter the linguistic argument with the analogy that he would prefer to believe that African-Americans came from Africa, judging from their skin colour, and not from England, judging from their speech.

We show sadness and happiness through our expressions.

But a new study shows that our faces can do more than we think. Scientists from Ohio State University found out that humans can actually make 21 different facial expressions after studying how people move their facial muscles. The scientists took pictures of 230 volunteers making faces in response to different cues .These cues included phrases like \\"you just got some great unexpected news\\", which produced a \\"happily surprised\\" reaction from volunteers. Other cues included \\"you smell a bad odor \\", which caused \\"disgusted\\" faces. In total, around 5,000 pictures were taken of the volunteers. The scientists then studied similarities of these pictures using a computer expression database. _ helped them to define a facial expression. \\"That tells us that these 21 emotions are expressed in the same way by nearly everyone,\\" said DrAleix Martinez to The Daily Telegraph. For example, to express surprise, 92 percent of volunteers widened their eyes and opened their mouth. And 99 percent raised their cheeks and smiled to show being happy.

(Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images) Mark Wahlberg was paid 1.5 million for reshooting his scenes in All the Money in the World, three people familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly about it tell USA TODAY, while Michelle Williams was paid an 80 per diem totaling less than 1,000. That works out to Williams being paid less than one-tenth of 1% of her male co-star. Ridley Scott’s Getty kidnapping drama was hastily reshot the week of Thanksgiving after a cascade of sexual misconduct allegations were made public against Kevin Spacey, who had starred in the drama as billionaire J. Paul Getty. More: Three major arguments happening around the Hollywood pay gap, explained Scott transfixed the film world by quickly assembling his actors in Europe, reshooting Spacey’s scenes with Christopher Plummer — and still making his Christmas release window. The wave of publicity that followed made All the Money in the World, distributed by Sony and financed by Imperative Entertainment, roll into Sunday’s Golden Globes as a relative triumph. CLOSE Actor and 'All The Money In The World' star Mark Wahlberg discusses the recasting of Kevin Spacey's role and awards buzz during the movie's premiere in California. Newslook But new information reveals ugly math behind the Hollywood victory. The reshoot cost 10 million (a fee put up by producing arm Imperative). In December, Scott told USA TODAY that the undertaking was aided by the fact that \\"everyone did it for nothing.” The exchange went as follows: RIDLEY SCOTT: “The whole reshoot was — in normal terms was expensive but not as expensive as you think. Because all of them, everyone did it for nothing.” USA TODAY: “Really?” SCOTT: “No, I wouldn’t get paid, I refused to get paid.” USA TODAY: “You didn’t pay the actors more to do it?” SCOTT: “No, they all came in free. Christopher had to get paid. But Michelle, no. Me, no. I wouldn’t do that to — ” USA TODAY: “The crew, of course, did get paid?” SCOTT: “Of course.” USA TODAY has since learned Wahlberg's team actually negotiated a hefty fee, with the actor paid 1.5 million for his reshoots. Williams wasn't told. Fletcher Chace (Mark Wahlberg) helps Gail Harris (Michelle Williams) deal with the high-profile kidnapping of her son in 'All the Money in the World.'

In August, Forbes named Wahlberg the highest-paid actor of the year, calculating his pretax and pre-fee earnings at 68 million. The Washington Post first reported Wahlberg's reshoot fee, noting that the actor “along with manager Stephen Levinson and agency WME, have a reputation in Hollywood for driving a tough bargain.” Williams previously told USA TODAY that when Scott's team called to request her time for the reshoot, \\"I said I'd be wherever they needed me, whenever they needed me. And they could have my salary, they could have my holiday, whatever they wanted. Because I appreciated so much that they were making this massive effort.\\" All the Money in the World has lagged at the box office, this past weekend coming in 10th place. The drama has grossed 20.2 million since its release two weeks ago. The pay disparity arrives as the entertainment industry continues to be rocked by the downfall of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, a flood of sexual misconduct allegations against dozens of other powerful Hollywood figures and a rising #MeToo movement. Two days ago at the Golden Globes, male and female stars wore black in solidarity with the newly established Time's Up initiative, which pushes for protection for victims of sexual harassment and gender inequality.

While only three actresses made more than 20 million in 12 months, 16 actors broached the mark. This pay disparity is due, in part, to roles: There are simply fewer main female characters in the superhero movies and blockbusters that pay the sizeable backend profits that result in leading men's large paydays, or the franchise sequels that permit aggressive negotiation for future installments. According to a 2016 study, women comprise just 28.7% of all speaking roles in movies. In order to visualize the difference in paychecks, we combined our lists of highest-paid actors and actresses. Emma Stone, who was this year's top-ranked actress, lands at No. 15 when stacked up with the men. Mark Wahlberg, the highest-paid actor, made more than 2.5 times her 26 million pretax take-home. Melissa McCarthy, ranked No. 4 among actresses with 18 million, ties for No. 21 with Chris Evans. Earnings estimates are based on data from Nielsen, ComScore, Box Office Mojo and IMDB, as well as interviews with industry insiders.

Veteran director Scott conducted widely talked about reshoots on the crime drama in November to replace Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer ahead of its December 22 domestic release. Spacey was edited out of the film after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him, including an accusation from Star Trek: Discovery actor Anthony Rapp. But USA Today reports that Williams, the Golden Globe-winning and Academy Award-nominated, female lead star of the film was paid 1 percent of her male supporting co-star—despite receiving top billing on promotional artwork. Williams, 37, received a 80 per diem stipend, effectively filming the reshoots for free, reports USA Today. Wahlberg’s agents, however, negotiated a fee of 1.5 million for the actor for the same reshoots, the newspaper says. Kevin Winter/Getty The cost of reshooting scenes was reportedly 10 million and was funded by production company Imperative Entertainment. See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows Scott, in interviews promoting All the Money in the World, claimed that he and the cast worked for free because they believed it was important to reshoot scenes in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against Spacey and other Hollywood figures since October. USA Today says Scott, 80, told the paper “all of them, everyone did it for nothing.” Williams added: \\"I said I'd be wherever they needed me, whenever they needed me.

On Twitter, Williams received support from the likes of fellow Oscar nominee Jessica Chastain, who urged people to support the actor’s performance. Amber Tamblyn and more also weighed in: The disparity between Williams’s pay and Wahlberg’s echoes the situation involving Jennifer Lawrence on American Hustle.

Thync shares science behind its brain-zapping wearable Thync has been steadily gathering attention for its far-out claim that its next-gen gadget, a wireless wearable electrode for your brain, can tune your mood. It offers two settings, “calm” and “energize.” The Boston company says its device can amp up your alertness like a shot of caffeine or mellow you out like a good massage — all with a precisely designed pulse of current. By and large, according to reports from tech media and technology and health professionals who have tried the device, it seems that Thync is delivering on its promise. (I tried it and felt significantly blissed-out afterward.) And for the first time, Thync has published a study that explains some of the magic behind the mad idea. It’s still awaiting peer review, but the study does provide an appetizer of experimental evidence that the device actually works. The move is unusual for tech companies, which are typically secretive about internal studies. But it’s in keeping with Thync’s goal of being transparent to its potential customers, said its cofounder and chief scientific officer, William “Jamie” Tyler. Publishing the paper is also an opportunity to present the device to the academic and medical communities. So how does it work? Touch-sensitive cranial nerves on your face already carry tactile information to the brain. Thync seems to have found a way to have a precise — and very mild — current of electricity piggy-back on that path and adjust the volume on the part of the brain that controls the stress response. The device is the size of a potato chip and clings to your temple; the pulses are controlled by an app on a smartphone. “We’re signaling the brain through a pathway that’s already there,” Tyler said. “It’s like the gas pedal in your car. Basically if you press down on the gas, you start going fast.” The timing for the study is no accident: The company plans to start selling the one-of-a-kind device this year, but has not decided on a price. “That’s why we’re ready to go to market — because we’re convinced by the science,” Tyler said. Unlike in electroshock therapy, the controversial treatment for conditions such as depression, Tyler said the intensity of the current from the device is lower than the electrical activity that’s already going on in the brain. Also, Thync plans to steer clear of medical applications and instead hopes to sell its product as a replacement for stimulants like caffeine and alcohol. Still, the company is in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration about regulatory requirements, but has yet to disclose details. In the company’s tests, 82 subjects experienced a 14-minute session with the Thync device on the “calm” setting, and 14 minutes with a similarly shaped “sham” device that wasn’t electrified. Thync’s scientific team then documented physiological signs — sweat and body temperature, for example — as well as chemical ones, like looking for signs of a protein that is present in the early stages of a stress response. The calming effect was evident when the subjects wore the real device; it was absent when they wore the version without the current. “It’s not the complete story start to finish, but it’s interesting,” sad Alik Widge, who studies brain stimulation at Massachusetts General Hospital’s Division of Neurotherapeutics in the Department of Psychiatry. Researchers have been experimenting with electricity and the brain for decades, but Widge noted that Tyler and his crew at Thync are taking a fundamentally different approach by using stick-on electrodes rather than implanting them surgically. Such a device could be a great resource for researchers who are looking into brain-stimulation therapies for conditions like depression. If it works, that is. Widge said he wants to see more evidence that what we’re seeing is more than a placebo effect. “I look at this the same way I see a vitamin supplement or a food-as-medicine kind of thing — it’s certainly not going to hurt the person,” Widge said. Widge also said he was interested in seeing an independent lab replicate the results in follow-up studies, and he’d look to also monitor the results in an MRI scanner. Tyler said he is hoping for exactly this type of collaboration to occur.

Thync's gadget has two settings, 'calm' and 'energize,' which can either increase alertness or create a relaxing feeling.

Thync's device works by utilizing touch-sensitive cranial nerves on the face that convey tactile information to the brain.

The company is currently in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration regarding regulatory requirements, although no details have been revealed. Overall, Thync's study showed promising results; participants experienced a calming effect when using the actual device but not when using a sham version without any electrical current.

The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. Question: After completing the study, how does the author feel about the results? Options: - They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost - not enough information - They believe they have unhealthy dietary habits - They believe there were no changes The answer to this question is:","completion":"They believe restricting eating at night did result in a small amount of weight lost."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he watched the mother and daughter leave the store, he ran to the candy counter and bought a box of Smarties with the money . He turned to look at me and I just nodded.

He came back and told me what he told them. \\"Every kid should have a pack of Smarties because they can make you smart.\\" I was so excited that I bought a pack of Smarties for my son. I told him that I was proud of him, and that was for his act of generosity because he gave his own Smarties to others.

What happened to the LinkedIn Research Network?","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They refer to distinct aspects of the LinkedIn platform. Question 1: Why are some names on the LinkedIn network a gray color? This question is concerned with the appearance of names on the LinkedIn platform, specifically regarding the color gray. There could be several reasons why some names appear in gray on the LinkedIn network: 1. Unconnected profiles: When browsing through search results or suggested connections, names in gray might indicate profiles with whom you are not currently connected. LinkedIn primarily uses the color gray to differentiate between connected and unconnected profiles. Once you connect with such profiles and they accept your connection request, the gray color usually changes. 2. Non-clickable profiles: Profiles that appear in gray and are not clickable might indicate that these users either have a limited profile or have chosen to keep their profile less visible to the public. LinkedIn offers users the option to manage their privacy settings, allowing them to hide specific information or make their profile less visible. 3. Deleted or Suspended accounts: On occasion, grayed-out names may represent profiles that have been deleted or temporarily suspended by the LinkedIn platform administration as a result of alleged scams, spamming, or violations of LinkedIn's User Agreement and policies. 4. Technical issues: Lastly, though less likely, there could be a technical issue or temporary glitch on LinkedIn, causing names to appear gray. Refreshing the page or restarting your browser and logging in again usually resolves such issues. Question 2: What happened to the LinkedIn Research Network? LinkedIn Research Network (LRN) was a specialized unit of LinkedIn that enabled market research professionals to connect, collaborate and exchange information. Launched in June 2008, LRN featured a mix of tools, features, and content to empower research professionals and knowledge workers in their daily tasks. However, the LinkedIn Research Network was closed in 2010. The decision to shut it down may have stemmed from several factors, including low user engagement, the need to refine LinkedIn's focus on its core services, and the evolving landscape of research and professional networking. After the shutdown, LinkedIn shifted its attention to enhancing its existing features and services aimed at helping professionals exchange ideas and knowledge. Some of these features include LinkedIn Groups and LinkedIn Pages, which provide companies and individuals with platforms to connect with their peers in their respective industries. In summary, while these two questions both relate to LinkedIn, they address different topics. The first question refers to the appearance and meaning of gray-colored names, while the second question inquires about the LinkedIn Research Network and its discontinuation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

La primera opción, \\"Teodora fue arrestada por la policía de Hayward debido a una identidad equivocada.\\" es una traducción más directa de la oración en inglés. Sin embargo, la segunda opción, \\"Teodora fue detenida por la policía de Hayward por un caso de confusión de identidad.\\" se enfoca más en el concepto de confusión o error en la identificación, lo cual puede hacerla sonar más natural en español a veces. Aquí te explico cada parte de la oración: 1. \\"Teodora\\" - el nombre de la persona en cuestión se mantiene igual en ambos idiomas. 2. \\"fue arrestada\\" / \\"fue detenida\\" - ambas opciones se usan para indicar que alguien ha sido arrestado o detenido por la policía. \\"Fue arrestada\\" es un poco más formal, mientras que \\"fue detenida\\" se utiliza comúnmente en conversaciones cotidianas. 3. \\"por la policía de Hayward\\" - esta parte especifica quién realizó el arresto. La palabra \\"policía\\" en español es tanto singular como plural, y se utiliza aquí en singular para referirse a la fuerza policial en general. \\"Hayward\\" se mantiene igual ya que es el nombre de una ciudad. 4. \\"debido a\\" / \\"por un caso de\\" - estos términos se utilizan para introducir la razón o el motivo detrás del arresto. \\"Debido a\\" puede traducirse como \\"because of\\" en inglés, mientras que \\"por un caso de\\" puede entenderse como \\"in a case of\\" en inglés. 5. \\"identidad equivocada\\" / \\"confusión de identidad\\" - ambas opciones reflejan el concepto de que el arresto fue causado por un error en la identificación de Teodora. \\"Identidad equivocada\\" sugiere que la policía se confundió al identificar a Teodora como alguien más. Mientras tanto, \\"confusión de identidad\\" hace hincapié en el hecho de que hubo una confusión o error involucrado en la situación.

Answer the following question. The plays 'The Barber of Seville' and 'Marriage of Figaro' were written by whom?","completion":"The plays 'The Barber of Seville' and 'Marriage of Figaro' were both written by the French playwright Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais. Beaumarchais was born in Paris on January 24, 1732, and died on May 18, 1799. He is best known for his three Figaro plays, which revolve around the central character of Figaro. 'The Barber of Seville', originally titled 'Le Barbier de Séville', is a four-act comedy written in French. Beaumarchais completed the work in 1773, and it was first performed on February 23, 1775, at the Comédie-Française in Paris. The play revolves around the schemes of Count Almaviva, who, with the help of Figaro, attempts to win the heart and hand of the beautiful Rosine, who is under the control of her elderly guardian, Doctor Bartholo. The story is filled with comedy, wit, and romance and is regarded as a major classic of French theatre. 'The Marriage of Figaro', originally titled 'La Folle Journée, ou Le Mariage de Figaro', is a five-act comedy also written in French by Beaumarchais. Completed in 1778, it is a sequel to 'The Barber of Seville'. 'The Marriage of Figaro' was initially banned by the French monarchy due to its potentially subversive content, but it finally premiered on April 27, 1784, at the Comédie-Française. The play follows the continuing adventures of Figaro, who is now the valet of Count Almaviva. Figaro plans to marry the beautiful Suzanne, the countess's maid, but faces multiple obstacles, including the count's wandering eye and a series of comedic misunderstandings and deceptions. This play also highlights the tensions between social classes and comes to symbolize the impending French Revolution. Both 'The Barber of Seville' and 'The Marriage of Figaro' have been adapted numerous times, most notably as operas. The Italian composer Gioachino Rossini transformed 'The Barber of Seville' into an opera buffa, which premiered in Rome in 1816, while Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart adapted 'The Marriage of Figaro' into an opera buffa, which premiered in Vienna in 1786. These operatic adaptations have reached a wide audience over the centuries and continue to be popular and well-loved productions within the world of opera and classical music."},{"prompt":"Select from the following.

There he meets his boss Henry Bullard and his wife Aggie Bullard. John tries to civilize them, building schools and providing education for the Iban people. He is met with unfamiliar local customs. Selima becomes his \\"sleeping dictionary\\", who sleeps with him and teaches him the language and the habits of the locals. John is sent up river where a sickness is affecting the Yakata tribe. He and Selima travel inland. John witnesses a nearby mining operation run by Europeans.

Article: If cars had wings, they could fly and that just might happen, beginning in 2012. The company Terrafugia, based in Woburn, Massachusetts, says it plans to deliver its car-plane, the Transition, to customers by the end of 2012. \\"It's next 'wow' vehicle,\\" said Terrafugia vice president Richard Gersh. \\"Anybody can buy a Ferrari, but as we say, Ferraris don't fly.\\" The car-plane has wings that unfold for flying-a process the company says takes one minute-and fold back up for driving. A runway is still required to take off and land. The Transition is being marketed more as a plane that drives than a car that flies, although it is both. The company has been working with FAA to meet aircraft regulations, and with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to meet vehicle safety regulations. The company is aiming to sell the Transition to private pilots as a more convenient and cheaper way to fly. They say it saves you the trouble from trying to find another mode of transportation to get to and from airports: You drive the car to the airport and then you're good to go. When you land, you hold up the wings and hit the road. There are no expensive parking fees because you don't have to store it at an airport-you park it in the garage at home. The car-plane is designed to fly primarily under 10,000 feet. It has a maximum takeoff weight of 1,430 pounds, including fuel and passengers. Thrrafugia says the Transition reduces the potential for an accident by allowing pilots to drive under the bad weather instead of flying into marginal conditions. The Transition's price tag: 194,000. But there may be additional charges for options like a radio, , a transponder or a GPS. Another option is a full-plane parachute. \\"If you get into a very awful situation, it is the necessary safety option.\\" Gersh said. So far, the company has more than 70 orders with deposits. \\"We're working very closely with them, but there are still some remaining steps,\\" Brown said.

The group started as a children's group in 1982 and managed to evolve successfully into adulthood. Timbiriche is considered one of the most iconic Latin Pop acts of the 1980s and the early 1990s. It was the seed of numerous figures in the Latin American entertainment world, including successful singers like Thalia, Paulina Rubio and Edith Marquez, as well as actors, composers and conductors. Without the majority of its original members, the group was in decline, but the producers decided to continue with the concept and bet on launching a new generation. Surprisingly, in the midst of production, Claudio is fired from the group. By the end of 1991, the band returns with five new members: Lorena Shelley, Daniel Gaytan, Tannya Velasco, Kenya Hijuelos and Alexa Lozano. Together with Diego and Silvia they record the album Timbiriche XI. Kenya leaves the group before the official presentation of the disc by decision of the creators of the group by conflicts between the new members, being replaced by Jean Duverger. This second generation is officially presented during a broadcast of Siempre en domingo, in which all former members were invited to introduce the new members. This meeting was unique, since it had almost all the members of the group, being the only ones missing Diego, due to health problems and Thalia, who was working in Spain. Despite retaining the name and concept in general, there was a new musical style that mixed dance and tropical rhythms. Although the album was not so popular with fans of the first generation, it began to appeal to younger generations, thanks to hitls like Vanidosa, Solo te quiero a ti, Tierra dorada, and Piel a piel, receiving disc of Gold and platinum by high sales.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The net quality of a ground reflection depends on the topography of the surface. When the irregularities of the surface are much smaller than the wavelength, we are in the regime of specular reflection, and the receiver sees both the real antenna and an image of the antenna under the ground due to reflection. But if the ground has irregularities not small compared to the wavelength, reflections will not be coherent but shifted by random phases. With shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies), this is generally the case. What is the net quality of the ground dependent of? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The net quality of ground reflection is dependent on several factors, which include: 1. Surface topography: The terrain's irregularities and surface roughness play a significant role in determining the net quality of the ground reflection. When the surface irregularities are much smaller than the wavelength, specular reflection occurs, leading to an easily distinguishable reflection in the receiver's sight. However, if the ground has irregularities comparable to or larger than the wavelength, reflections will not be coherent, resulting in random phase shifts and decreased net quality. 2. Wavelength and frequency: The wavelength and frequency of the signal also have a direct impact on the net quality of ground reflection. Shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies) are more susceptible to scattering and diffraction due to surface irregularities compared to longer wavelengths (lower frequencies). Therefore, at higher frequencies, the net quality is generally lower due to the increased likelihood of incoherent reflections. 3. Ground material properties: The composition and electrical properties of the ground significantly impact the net quality of ground reflection. Softer ground materials, such as soil, sand, and vegetation, tend to absorb more energy and attenuate the signal, while harder materials, such as concrete and asphalt, are better reflectors. Additionally, the ground's dielectric constant, electrical conductivity, and magnetic permeability also affect the reflection, absorption, and scattering of the signal. 4. Polarization and angle of incidence: The orientation and angle at which the signal impacts the ground surface will also affect the net quality of ground reflection. Signals polarized parallel to the surface tend to reflect better than those polarized perpendicular to the surface. The angle of incidence also matters, as shallow angles usually result in better reflection, while steep angles may cause the signal to penetrate deeper into the ground, increasing losses due to absorption. 5. Local environment: Factors such as the presence of buildings, trees, and other structures can also contribute to the net quality of ground reflection. These objects may cause additional reflection, diffraction, or scattering, which could interfere with the primary ground reflection and decrease the net quality. In summary, the net quality of ground reflection depends on various factors, including surface topography, wavelength and frequency, ground material properties, polarization and angle of incidence, and the local environment. Collectively, these factors determine the strength and coherence of ground-reflected signals, thereby affecting the overall net quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

John Locke in particular exemplified this new age of political theory with his work Two Treatises of Government. In it Locke proposes a state of nature theory that directly complements his conception of how political development occurs and how it can be founded through contractual obligation. Locke stood to refute Sir Robert Filmer's paternally founded political theory in favor of a natural system based on nature in a particular given system. The theory of the divine right of kings became a passing fancy, exposed to the type of ridicule with which John Locke treated it. Unlike Machiavelli and Hobbes but like Aquinas, Locke would accept Aristotle's dictum that man seeks to be happy in a state of social harmony as a social animal. Unlike Aquinas's preponderant view on the salvation of the soul from original sin, Locke believes man's mind comes into this world as tabula rasa. For Locke, knowledge is neither innate, revealed nor based on authority but subject to uncertainty tempered by reason, tolerance and moderation. According to Locke, an absolute ruler as proposed by Hobbes is unnecessary, for natural law is based on reason and seeking peace and survival for man.

It could be two, three, or even more. The desired conclusion specifies \\"two teenage boys,\\" so we would need information about the number of individuals in the situation. 2. Age and gender of the individuals: The statement makes no reference to the age nor the gender of the individuals involved. We cannot determine whether they are teenage boys, adult women, or any other possible age and gender combination based on the given statement. 3. The act of walking together: Although we know that the tall humans are walking, we do not have any information indicating that they are walking together. They could be independently walking, walking in a group, or walking with other people not mentioned in the statement. This information is missing to conclude that the two individuals are walking together. 4. Location: The desired conclusion specifies that the walking is happening \\"down the sidewalk in a city.\\"The original statement does not provide any information about the location, so we cannot determine whether the humans are walking down a sidewalk in a city, a rural road, a park, or any other possible location. 5. Additional context: The given statement also excludes any further details about the situation, such as the time of day, the reason for walking, or any other characteristics of the individuals involved.

Context: LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the answer for the question: To whom is Millar referring when he observes that, positively, any comparisons undertaken would demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm? from the following article ? In his field and day, Wright was certainly eclipsed by his rival the more prolific Lely, to whom he is often compared. One critic, Millar, observes that any comparisons undertaken would \\"ruthlessly expose Wright's weaknesses and mannerisms\\" but that positively \\"they would also demonstrate his remarkable independence, his unfailing integrity and charm, the sources of which must partly lie in his unusual origins, fragmented career and attractive personality\\". Millar suggests that a particularly useful comparison can be made between Lely and Wright's respective portrayals of the Duchess of Clevland (Barbara Villiers) (above). Whereas Lely portrayed her as a \\"full-blown and palpably desirable strumpet\\", the more seriously minded Wright, who was not really in sympathy with the morality of the new court and its courtesans, rendered a more puppet-like figure.However, even if Lely was considered the more masterly and fashionable of the two in seventeenth-century Britain, Wright is generally accepted as portraying the more lively and realistic likenesses of his subjects, a fact that reinforces Pepys's observation that Lely's work was \\"good but not like\\". Neither should Wright's realism be confused with a prudishness; as can be seen, for example, in his portrait the lady, thought to be Ann Davis (right). The picture, with the sitter's clothing left undone and her modesty barely preserved by a red drape, has been described as exhibiting a fresh – even risky – reality: erotic by contemporary standards. Whereas Wright's contemporaries might have used the ‘disguise’ of presenting the sitter in the guise of a classical goddess to protect against accusation of salaciousness, Wright's portrait rather depends on his realism, notably in his flesh tones, and depth.","completion":"In the given article, Millar is referring to the painter John Michael Wright when he observes that, positively, any comparisons undertaken between Wright and his rival Sir Peter Lely would demonstrate Wright's remarkable independence, unfailing integrity, and charm. The article mainly focuses on the comparison of Wright and Lely, both of whom were prominent painters during the seventeenth century in Britain.

To understand the whole situation better, let's dive into more details behind this narrative. Choosing cabinets is essential when remodeling or organizing a space, as they contribute significantly to the room's aesthetics and storage capacity. Therefore, when two or more people are involved in a project, they commonly want to have equal say and contributions, to ensure that the results meet both of their tastes, preferences and needs. In the given sentence, Maria was given the authority and responsibility to choose the cabinets for a space that she and Katrina both shared or needed to use. Since Maria took complete charge without Katrina's input, it led to a decision that left Katrina unhappy. This could have been a result of various factors, including differences in taste, Katrina's desire to have more storage capacity or specific functional requirements, or the chosen cabinets not fitting the overall design aesthetic that Katrina had envisioned. It is crucial to consider the input of all involved parties in decision-making processes to avoid conflict and dissatisfaction. By neglecting to do so, situations like the one described could arise, where one party feels ignored, and the resulting decision fails to meet their needs. Had the sentence ended with Katrina having complete say in the choice that was made, it would indicate that Maria disregarded her request or suggestions, resulting in a selection of cabinets that Maria would like instead of agreeing with the decision to which Katrina was entitled. However, this is not the case in the given sentence, as Maria had complete control over the decision, leading to Katrina's displeasure. The unequal contribution within the decision-making process has consequently caused feelings of dislike and resentment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He was presumed dead, but Clara Gantt, now 94, held out hope and never remarried. On Friday morning on the Los Angeles International Airport tarmac, the widow stood from her wheelchair and cried as her husband's flag-draped casket arrived home. He was one of hundreds of U.S. soldiers whose remains have been turned over by the North Korean government in recent years. \\"I told him I missed him so much,\\" she said softly. \\"And I expect him to come home and he didn't.\\" Remains returned: An article in the Dec. 21 Section A about a missing soldier's remains being returned to his widow nearly 63 years after his death said the North Korean government returned the remains to the U.S. The remains of Army Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Gantt were turned over by a South Korean citizen. — He never saw the house in Inglewood, just a few miles from where she greeted his remains. He hated yardwork, and never wanted the hassle of owning a home. She bought him one anyway and hired a gardener so he could do whatever he pleased when he came home to her. A wall of her bedroom is covered with military certificates and photos — his barracks, him in front of a white picket fence during World War II, his father. A copy of her picture — the one he always kept with him — stands nearby. A teddy bear in army fatigues sits in her living room, near an American flag with his photo tucked into the glass display. She's afraid to hang his medals, which include the Bronze Star with Valor, awarded posthumously, and a Purple Heart, for fear they'd be stolen during one of many break-ins that have happened on the street where she's lived since the 1960s. She would rather they be safe in a museum. Gantt said she never stopped waiting for word, but she forged ahead with her own life. She worked for years as a caregiver for people with disabilities, as well as children. She and her husband had always wanted to have kids, and working with them gave her pleasure. \\"I would just pray and ask the Lord to let me live until they find a closure for him so I can be here to put him away myself,\\" she said, wearing a dog tag with his photo printed on it given to her at the morning ceremony. :: Joseph Gantt joined the Army in 1942 and served in the South Pacific during WWII. Clara was one of 18 children who grew up on a farm in Texas. She tired of being at home, she said, so in her 20s she used the money she saved working in a cafeteria to take a train to California. It was on the train the two met in 1946, when Joseph beat his fellow soldiers to speaking to the woman who would two years later become his wife. They were sweethearts for a long time because she refused to marry him — she feared he might already have a wife. She wrote \\"Uncle Sam\\" to get the truth, and finally agreed when the answer she was looking for came along. They lived in Fort Lewis, Washington until he left for the Korean War, assigned as a field medic, Battery C, 503rd Field Artillery Battalion, 2nd Infantry Division. In December 1950, she received a letter from him and 100 for Christmas. That month, he was taken prisoner defending his unit's position near Kunu-ri' Korea. He died in March 1951, officials later discovered. Over the years, she's been to dozens of meetings in Washington, D.C., meant to update the wives and family members of veterans. Some 84,000 service members, including 8,000 from the Korean War, are still missing. Her family has told her she's crazy to attend the meetings after so long, but he was her husband, she said. She'd keep going even if she was in a wheelchair. When she got a call asking if she would be in Washington for the October meeting, she knew what was coming. She flew there, alone, and was told her husband's remains had been found. Then they read the letter she wrote the government so many years ago, inquiring about his marital status. In recent years, the remains were finally returned to the U.S. by North Korea, then sent to a forensics lab in Honolulu to be identified, said Bob Kurkjian, executive director of USO Greater Los Angeles Area. :: During the last 63 years, no one else caught Clara Gantt's fancy as she waited for news of her husband. She told the base officials assigned to check wives' homes for other men to come by anytime, they'd never catch her with anyone. \\"I am very, very proud of him. He was a wonderful husband, an understanding man,\\" she told reporters at the airport. \\"I always did love my husband, we was two of one kind, we loved each other.

Gantt went off to war 63 years ago, leaving behind a wife who never gave up on his return. On Friday, 94-year-old Clara Gantt stood up from her wheelchair and wept in the cold before the flag-draped casket. Sgt. Gantt was finally home. \\"He told me if anything happened to him he wanted me to remarry. I told him no, no. Here I am, still his wife,\\" she told reporters at Los Angeles International Airport, where his remains were carried from a jetliner by military honor guard. Gant was a field medic who went missing in action on Nov. 30, 1950 during the Korean War while serving with Battery C, 503rd Field Artillery, 2nd Infantry Division, according to the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office in Washington, D.C. According to the office, elements of the 2nd Infantry Division were attacked by greater numbers of Chinese forces near the town of Kunu-ri, North Korea. The division disengaged and withdrew, fighting its way through a series of Chinese roadblocks. Numerous U.S. soldiers were reported missing that day in the vicinity of Somindong, North Korea. After a 1953 exchange of prisoners of war, returning U.S. soldiers reported that Gantt had been injured in battle, captured by Chinese forces and died in a POW camp in early 1951 from malnutrition and lack of medical care. His remains were only recently identified. Information on when they were found was not immediately available from the missing personnel office. Nearly 7,900 Americans are still unaccounted for from the Korean War. According to the Defense Department, modern technology allows identifications to continue to be made from remains turned over by North Korea or recovered from that nation by American teams. \\"Sixty-some odd years and just receiving his remains, coming home, was a blessing and I am so happy that I was living to accept him,\\" Clara Gantt said. She met her future husband in 1946 while on a train heading to California. Two years later, they were married. She lives a few miles away from the airport in Inglewood. She bought the home in the 1960s to await her husband's return and even hired a gardener because he hated yardwork, she told the Los Angeles Times (http://lat.ms/1dYMORj) One wall of her bedroom is covered with photos of military certificates and photos but Gantt said she hasn't displayed his posthumously awarded Purple Heart and Bronze Star with Valor for fear they would be stolen; there have been many break-ins over the years in her neighborhood.

For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

A: Available choices: + protons + nuclei + atoms + electrons Answer:","completion":"A: Amines are weak bases due to the presence of a lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atom. Step 1: Understand the question - The question is asking about the reason why amines are weak bases and the presence of a specific feature on the nitrogen atom. Step 2: Identify the relevant concept - Amines are organic compounds in which nitrogen is bonded to a carbon or hydrogen atom. They have a lone pair on the nitrogen atom. Step 3: Recall the basic chemistry definitions - A proton is a positively charged particle found in the nucleus of atoms. Nuclei are the central region of atoms containing protons and neutrons. Atoms are the smallest unit of matter comprising protons, neutrons, and electrons. Electrons are negatively charged particles surrounding the nucleus of atoms. Step 4: Analyze the available choices: - Protons: Amines do contain nitrogen, which has protons in its nucleus, but the presence of protons is not a unique feature of nitrogen that contributes to its basicity. - Nuclei: While the nitrogen nucleus is part of the amine, it doesn't directly explain the molecule's weak base nature. - Atoms: This option is too general and doesn't address the specific feature responsible for the basicity of amines. - Electrons: The nitrogen atom in amines indeed has a lone pair of electrons that can accept protons, which makes amines weak bases. Step 5: Select the correct answer - Based on the analysis, I can conclude that electrons are the correct answer because they are the source of the lone pair responsible for the weak basic nature of amines."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: Kabul - A month out from the polls, the three frontrunners in Afghanistan’s presidential election have debated their policies on the future of the nation’s foreign relations. Tuesday’s debate, aired live on Tolo TV, saw Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, Doctor Abdullah Abdullah and Doctor Zalmai Rassoul discuss the impact of foreign relations on security, aid and the economy. Moderator Mujahid Kakkar first asked the candidates if they accepted the Durand Line, the disputed 2,640km border separating Afghanistan from Pakistan. Rassoul said the validity of the border — established by an 1893 memorandum of understanding — was not up to a single government to determine. Instead, its status must be addressed through consultation with the Afghan people. Abdullah agreed, saying any decision on the Durand Line must come from the people and parliament. Ahmadzai, however, said while Pakistan “does not and will not have the right to interfere in Afghanistan”, insecurity and insurgency, not the disputed border, were the nation’s first priority. Afghans, including the three leading candidates, have repeatedly accused Pakistan of providing safe havens for the armed opposition. “Pakistan is using the Afghan Taliban to reach its foreign policy goals,\\" said Abdullah. With regard to Afghanistan’s relations with the West and its role in foreign aid, all three candidates said they supported the Bilateral Security Agreement, which would stipulate guidelines for US forces remaining beyond the planned December international troop withdrawal or its alternative, a so-called \\"zero option\\". In November, President Hamid Karzai shocked many at home and abroad after he refused to sign the BSA without securing specific assurances from Washington. Karzai’s demands that the US made serious efforts to support peace talks with the armed opposition and guarantee that they would not interfere with the April 5 ballot came after a Loya Jirga, grand assembly, unanimously approved the pact. During the debate, the most direct support for the pact came from Ahmadzai, one of the agreement's lead negotiators, who said he would sign the BSA in his “first week in office\\". Both he and Rassoul said a zero option was unlikely, with Rassoul describing a complete US withdrawal as \\"near impossible\\". Washington had invested too much, both militarily and financially, in Afghanistan for it to be likely, he said. Abdullah, however, who came second to Karzai in the 2009 ballot, said the incumbent's “unbalanced and emotional” actions only increased the likelihood of a zero option. “The implementation of a zero option is increasing with each passing day,\\" said Abdullah. Karzai’s foreign policyAbdullah also accused Karzai of making “personal and emotional” decisions which had not only hurt the nation’s standing in the world but also hindered relations with potential partner nations. Ahmadzai, who headed the committee overseeing the transition to Afghan-led security, singled out Karzai’s relations with Islamabad. “Hamid Karzai has made many visits to Pakistan but without results,” he said. All three candidates said efforts must be made to strengthen Afghanistan’s ties with potential foreign partners, including Western states. Ahmadzai said it would be impossible for Afghanistan, in its current economic state, to continue to support its 350,000-strong security forces without Western help. “It is not possible to meet our current security expense without the help of the West.” Ahmadzai said Afghanistan must look for help from all possible sources, including regional neighbours China and India. Abdullah however, said regional support was not \\"a reasonable substitute for Western aid”. Describing Western relations as in a “delicate” state, Abdullah said increased diplomacy would be required to attract foreign aid beyond 2014. Rassoul, however, took a more positive stance on Kabul’s diplomacy. “Next to freedom of speech, our largest achievement has been improvements in our relations with the rest of the world.” With Karzai constitutionally barred from seeking a third term, the April 5 poll will mark the first peaceful, democratic transition of power in Afghanistan.

Mike sneezes around flowers, but is just fine around perfumes, so he must have an allergy to the","completion":"pollen produced by the flowers rather than the fragrance itself. To confirm this theory, let's consider the following steps: Step 1: Understand the differences between pollen and perfume Given that Mike is fine around perfumes but not around flowers, it's crucial to recognize the difference between pollen and perfume. Pollen is a fine powdery substance released by flowers, which is the primary cause of allergies in many people. Perfume, on the other hand, is a mixture of fragrant essential oils and aroma compounds that mimic the scent of flowers. Step 2: Rule out other causes Before concluding that Mike has an allergy to pollen, we should also rule out other potential causes of his sneezing. For example, he might be allergic to certain trees, grasses, or even an unrelated factor present in the environment where flowers are usually found. Step 3: Observe his reaction around non-floral perfumes We should also examine Mike's reactions to perfumes with scents other than flowers. This can help us rule out the possibility that Mike is fine with only specific types of fragrances instead of a broader immunity to all perfumes. Step 4: Consult with an allergist The most effective way to determine if Mike is indeed allergic to pollen is to consult an allergist who can perform tests and analyze his symptoms. Step 5: Take preventive measures If it is confirmed that Mike has a pollen allergy, he should avoid areas with a high concentration of flowers, especially during the pollen season. Utilizing air purifiers and wearing masks when necessary can also help in reducing the symptoms. In conclusion, the fact that Mike sneezes around flowers but not perfumes leads us to believe that he has an allergy to the pollen rather than the scent of the flowers. By following these steps, we can further investigate and confirm the cause of his allergy and take necessary actions to minimize his symptoms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was important for her to find a balance between maintaining her luscious locks and preserving the environment. Thus, she opted for the natural shampoo over the discounted conditioner. The shampoo was made by a small, family-owned company that took great pride in using natural ingredients – most of which were locally sourced. It did not contain any harsh chemical preservatives or synthetic fragrances, which usually pollute the air and water when they make their way down the drain during showering. Moreover, this family-owned business was committed to environmental sustainability, and all their packaging was made from recyclable materials. Natalie appreciated the company’s transparency, as they clearly stated their dedication to using organic and sustainably-sourced ingredients on the label. This included essential oils derived from plants grown without the use of synthetic pesticides or herbicides. There was a detailed list of all the components, and a thorough explanation of their benefits not only for the hair but also for the earth. In comparison, the discounted conditioner seemed like an appealing deal because of its lower price. However, upon closer inspection, Natalie noticed that the ingredient list was filled with an assortment of unpronounceable names and numbers, indicating an array of synthetic chemicals. Studies have shown that such ingredients can be harmful to aquatic wildlife when they get washed down the drain and end up in streams, rivers, and eventually the ocean. Besides, the manufacturer of the conditioner did not provide any information on their environmental impact or sustainability efforts. Furthermore, the conditioner's packaging was made from non-recyclable plastic, which contributes to the ever-growing plastic pollution problem. Natalie imagined that if she were to choose this product, the empty bottles might end up in a landfill or even worse, harm marine life in the oceans. Feeling confident in her decision, Natalie placed the natural shampoo in her cart and proceeded to the checkout counter. On her way out, she couldn't help but marvel at the growing number of eco-friendly products filling the store shelves. It was evident that she was not alone in her desire to make conscious choices. Upon using the shampoo for the first time, Natalie was delighted with the results. Her hair felt clean, refreshed, and revitalized, without any of the greasiness or residue that she sometimes experienced with her previous, cheaper shampoos. It had a delightful scent, thanks to the natural essential oils, that lingered in her hair even after she had rinsed it off. She happily shared her environmentally-conscious find with her friends and family, who were so impressed that some even began reevaluating their own personal care choices. Natalie furthered her commitment by researching and supporting other sustainable businesses and products, gradually transforming her everyday habits and decisions to contribute positively to the environment. By choosing the natural shampoo, Natalie started a ripple effect that not only benefited her own health and well-being but also inspired positive change within her circle and, eventually, her community.

The correct choice should be \\"Buffalo Jills for the 2014 season,\\" as it is mentioned that she was a cheerleader for the Buffalo Jills, which is the cheerleading squad affiliated with the Buffalo Bills football team. Incorrect options: - Alyssa for the 2014 season: This choice is incorrect because it refers to a person, Alyssa, not an organization. - Alyssa U for the 2014 season: Same as above, this option also refers to a person and not an organization. - Buffalo Bills for the 2014 season: This option is referring to the football team, not the cheerleading squad, which is the subject of the lawsuit. - Maria for the 2014 season: This choice is incorrect because there is no mention of a person named Maria in the passage. - NFL for the 2014 season: This option is incorrect because it refers to the National Football League in general, and the issue described in the passage pertains specifically to the cheerleading squad of the Buffalo Bills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Maya Angelou, writer and poet, dies at age 86 Maya Angelou, a child of the Jim Crow South who rose to international prominence as a writer known for her frank chronicles of personal history and a performer instantly identified by her regal presence and rich, honeyed voice, died May 28 at her home in Winston-Salem, N.C. She was 86. Her literary agent, Helen Brann, confirmed the death but said she did not know the cause. Ms. Angelou had heart ailments and had been in declining health for years. She established her literary reputation in 1970 with “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” a memoir detailing the racism and abuse she endured during her harrowing childhood. From her desperate early years, Ms. Angelou gradually moved into nightclub dancing and from there began a career in the arts that spanned more than 60 years. She sang cabaret and calypso, danced with Alvin Ailey, acted on Broadway, directed for film and television and wrote more than 30 books, including poetry, essays and, responding to the public's appetite for her life story, six autobiographies. She won three Grammy Awards for spoken-word recordings of her poetry and prose and was invited by President-elect Bill Clinton to read an original poem at his first inauguration in 1993, making her the second poet, after Robert Frost, to be so honored. The poem she read, “On the Pulse of Morning,” spoke of a hope that the country's diverse people would find new unity after chapters in U.S. history of oppression and division. “Lift up your eyes upon /The day breaking for you,” she said as the nation watched. “Give birth again /To the dream.” In 2011, President Obama presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. In a statement Wednesday, Obama described Ms. Angelou as “a truly phenomenal woman” and his sister Maya’s namesake. “A childhood of suffering and abuse actually drove her to stop speaking – but the voice she found helped generations of Americans find their rainbow amidst the clouds, and inspired the rest of us to be our best selves,” Obama said. It was her story of personal transformation in “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” that launched Ms. Angelou's career and brought her wide recognition as a symbol of strength overcoming struggle. “She brought an understanding of the dilemmas and dangers and exhilarations of black womanhood more to the fore than almost any autobiographer before her time,” said Arnold Rampersad, a literary critic and professor emeritus of English at Stanford University. “She challenged assumptions about what was possible for a poor black girl from the South, and she emerged as a figure of courage, honesty and grace.” The idea for “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” arose during conversations with friends, including James Baldwin, whom she met in Paris. Ms. Angelou initially resisted the suggestion that she write her story, giving in only after an editor goaded her by suggesting that writing autobiography as literature was too difficult for anyone to do well. “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” focused on growing up in her grandmother’s care in segregated Stamps, Ark., and on her rape by her mother’s boyfriend at age 7, “a breaking and entering when even the senses are torn apart.” Poet Maya Angelou reads \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at President Bill Clinton's 1993 inauguration. After she spoke her attacker’s name, he was found kicked to death in a lot behind a slaughterhouse. Convinced that her voice had the power to kill, she fell nearly silent for nearly five years. She spoke only to her beloved older brother, Bailey. “I had to stop talking,” she wrote. “I walked into rooms where people were laughing, their voices hitting the walls like stones, and I simply stood still — in the midst of a riot of sound. After a minute or two, silence would rush into the room from its hiding place because I had eaten up all the sounds.” The book, which came at the leading edge of a renaissance in literature by black female writers such as Toni Morrison and Alice Walker, traces the young Ms. Angelou’s effort to recover her voice and a sense of control over her body and her life, beginning with her recitation of “A Tale of Two Cities” at the behest of a family friend. Enduringly popular, “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings” has been translated into 17 languages, sold more than 1 million copies and still appears on high school and college reading lists. “There isn’t any easy, which is to say false line in the book,” wrote the novelist Ward Just in a Washington Post review. “It is not propaganda nor a history of the blacks, nor, most blessedly, sociology. It is one woman, Maya Angelou, writing about her life and times and writing from a talent so strong as to make each part of it immediate, direct, devastating and — oddly — beautiful.” Ms. Angelou produced five subsequent autobiographical volumes, avoiding distractions during her writing days by retreating to hotel rooms, where she removed art from the walls. She often arrived before dawn — dictionary, thesaurus and bottle of dry sherry in tow — and wrote longhand on yellow legal pads. None of her poetry or prose brought the same acclaim as “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” but critics praised her ability to weave street talk with literary references and the rhythm of church hymns. But in some sense, Ms. Angelou existed in a realm untouched by criticism. She developed a devoted group of readers who adored her and were drawn to her poems, which featured accessible rhymes and themes of cultivating love, conquering injustice and speaking out of silence. “You may write me down in history /With your bitter, twisted lies,” reads a poem in her 1978 collection, “And Still I Rise.” “You may trod me in the very dirt /But still, like dust, I’ll rise.” In 2002, she lent her name and verse to a line of Hallmark greeting cards, table runners and other products. “I want my work read,” she told The Post at the time. Her ability to reach a mass audience, including people who did not consider themselves poetry readers, set her apart. A fixture on the lecture circuit and a popular guest on Oprah Winfrey’s talk show, her personal story became a platform for her message of renewal and hope. “If God put the rainbows right in the clouds themselves, each one of us in the direst and dullest and most dreaded and dreary moments can see a possibility of hope,” she said in a speech at a conference at Weber State University in Utah in 1997. “Each one of us has the chance to be a rainbow in somebody’s cloud.” Maya Angelou was born Marguerite Ann Johnson on April 4, 1928, in St. Louis to Bailey Johnson, a dietitian, and Vivian Johnson, a card dealer and boardinghouse proprietor. Her parents divorced when she was 3, and they sent her to Arkansas with her brother Bailey — “the greatest person in my world,” she wrote, who called her “My,” “Mine,” and finally “Maya.” In 1940, she and Bailey moved to California to live with their mother. Ms. Angelou, who had discovered Shakespeare (“my first white love”) as a child in Stamps, graduated from Mission High School in San Francisco and took evening drama and dance classes. Concerned she might be a lesbian and wanting to prove she was “normal,” she propositioned a young man who lived up the street. After that one encounter, she became pregnant at age 16 with Clyde “Guy” Johnson, her only child. In addition to her son, survivors include two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She spent the next several years bouncing between jobs, scraping by first as a streetcar conductor and cook who read the Russians — Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Chekhov — in her free time. She said she also fell in love with a man who worked as a pimp, which led her to prostitution and then a stint as a madam. She tried to join the Women’s Army Corps but was rejected because the California Labor School, where she had taken dance classes, appeared on the House Un-American Activities Committee list of organizations with communist sympathies. Ever more desperate, she sold stolen clothes and flirted with drugs until a friend who was a heroin addict forced her to watch him shoot up. “He slouched, nodding, his mouth open and the saliva sliding down his chin as slowly as the blood had flowed down his arm,” she wrote in “Gather Together in My Name” (1974), the second volume of her autobiography. It was a turning point — the underworld revealed. “I had walked the precipice and seen it all; and at the critical moment, one man’s generosity pushed me safely away from the edge.” In the early 1950s, she married Tosh Angelos, a Greek American sailor. They divorced several years later, but it was during their marriage that she landed a dancing and singing gig at San Francisco’s famed Purple Onion nightclub and first used the name Angelou — a version of Angelos. In the mid-1950s, she toured 22 countries in Europe and Africa with a State Department production of the Gershwin folk opera “Porgy and Bess,” acted off-Broadway and released her first album of songs, “Miss Calypso.” She chronicled this blossoming of her performance career in “Singin’ and Swingin’ and Gettin’ Merry Like Christmas” (1976), the third volume of her autobiography. Ms. Angelou’s interest in writing grew from song lyrics to short stories, and, with the encouragement of John Oliver Killens, a friend and black novelist, she moved to New York City in 1959 to join the Harlem Writers Guild. Members of the Guild critiqued her writing and offered advice: “Write each sentence over and over again,” she recalled in “The Heart of a Woman” (1981) the fourth installment of her autobiography, “until it seems you’ve used every combination possible, then write it again.” In New York, Ms. Angelou was exposed to civil rights leaders, among them Bayard Rustin of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She helped organize and performed in the “Cabaret for Freedom,” an off-Broadway musical revenue and benefit for that organization, and performed in Jean Genet’s “The Blacks,” also off-Broadway, about everyday confrontations between whites and blacks. In 1960, Ms. Angelou replaced Rustin as the northern coordinator for the conference. She married a South African civil rights activist, Vusumzi Make, and they moved to Cairo, where she worked as an editor at an English-language newsweekly. The couple divorced soon after, but Ms. Angelou stayed in Africa with her son, working as a teacher and writer in Ghana. The West African country had won its independence from England five years earlier, in 1957, and its Pan-Africanist president, Kwame Nkrumah, invited African Americans to move there. Ms. Angelou became part of a group of black intellectuals who answered that call. “We knew that we were mostly unwanted in the land of our birth and saw promise on our ancestral continent,” she wrote in “All God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes” (1986), her fifth autobiography. Soon after returning to California in 1966, she wrote “Black, Blues, Black,” a 10-part television series about the role of African culture in the United States, and served as a lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles. She chronicled this period, including the assassinations of King and Malcolm X, in “A Song Flung Up to Heaven” (2002), her final installment of her memoir and one that comes full circle, ending as a younger Ms. Angelou sits down to write the first lines of “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.” After the critical and commercial success of “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” Ms. Angelou published her first volume of poetry, “Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ’fore I Diiie,” in 1971. The following year, she wrote the screenplay for the film “Georgia, Georgia,” about a black woman (played by Diana Sands) murdered for taking a white photographer as a lover. In 1973, Ms. Angelou married Paul du Feu, a carpenter, and they lived together in Berkeley, Calif., until their divorce eight years later. “I have lost good men — or men I might have been able to turn into good men — because I have no middle passage,” she told People in 1982. “I know that I’m not the easiest person to live with.” Du Feu was remodeling homes while Ms. Angelou wrote, directed for film and television, and acted. She was nominated for a Tony Award for her Broadway performance in “Look Away” (1973), a two-woman play about the friendship between first lady Mary Todd Lincoln (played by Geraldine Page) and Ms. Angelou’s character, Elizabeth Keckley. In the TV series “Roots” (1977), she played Kunta Kinte’s grandmother. In 1981, Ms. Angelou was appointed a lifetime member of the faculty at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. She continued to write, and her works included cookbooks and children’s books. In her many public speaking obligations, often at college commencements, she presented herself as a wise elder whose life was evidence of how far it is possible to travel. “See me now, black, female, American and Southern,” she said in a 1990 speech to students at Centenary College in Louisiana. “See me and see yourselves.

Question: What does the monster agree to do, as long as he swears to never speak of what he saw or describe the monster's appearance to anyone?

The main dish is to be Timmy (Matthew Lawrence), a young boy whom she has captured and chained up in her pantry. To stall her from stuffing and roasting him, the boy tells her three horror stories from a book she gave him, titled Tales from the Darkside. Lot 249[edit] In the first segment, Michael McDowell adapts Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, \\"Lot No. 249\\". A graduate student named Bellingham (played by Steve Buscemi) has been cheated by two classmates, Susan (Julianne Moore), and Lee (Robert Sedgwick), who framed him for theft to ruin his chances of winning a scholarship for which they were competing. As revenge, Bellingham reanimates a mummy and uses it to murder them both. Susan's brother Andy (Christian Slater) kidnaps Bellingham, and burns the parchment and mummy. He considers killing Bellingham, but in the end cannot bring himself to commit real murder. However, Bellingham brings Susan and Lee back from the dead (having switched the reanimation parchment with a similar one) and dispatches them to Andy's dorm, where they greet the terrified Andy by saying that Bellingham sends his regards.

Paragraph : Less photosynthesis means that plants and phytoplankton produce less food. A:","completion":"If Mona owns a greenhouse and decides to cover the top to restrict sunlight, her plants' ability to make food would decrease. The paragraph states that \\"less photosynthesis means that plants and phytoplankton produce less food.\\" Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (food) and oxygen. This process is essential for the growth and health of plants. By restricting sunlight in her greenhouse, Mona is effectively reducing the amount of light available for photosynthesis. As a result, her plants will have a harder time producing the glucose they need to grow and maintain their health. A decrease in photosynthesis ultimately leads to a decline in food production for the plants. In a greenhouse, plants are already experiencing controlled conditions such as temperature and humidity, which can help them grow more efficiently. However, sunlight is still a crucial factor for their growth and overall health. If Mona wants to maintain a healthy greenhouse and ensure her plants continue to grow and produce food, she should reconsider her decision to cover the top of her greenhouse in a way that might restrict sunlight. Instead, she could explore alternative methods to manage her plants' sunlight exposure, like adjusting the shading or using light-reflective surfaces within the greenhouse to optimize the distribution of available sunlight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: You are presented with the quiz \\"Sugar causes \\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"sugar causes food to taste sweet\\" and \\"for example, traditional wisdom warns that eating sweet foods causes diabetes\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Pick your answer from: +Glucose. +Energy.. +diabetes. +Rise. +Pollution. +symptoms. +Dehydration. +heat energy. Answer:","completion":"Based on the hints given by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"Sugar causes\\" would be \\"+diabetes.\\" Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the most appropriate answer choice: Firstly, the teacher mentioned that \\"sugar causes food to taste sweet,\\" which indicates that the answer should be related to the effects of sugar on the body. Among the given answer choices, \\"+Glucose,\\" \\"+Energy,\\" and \\"+diabetes\\" seem to be the most relevant to this context. Now, let's examine the second hint provided by the teacher: \\"For example, traditional wisdom warns that eating sweet foods causes diabetes.\\" This statement is more specific and clearly points out a connection between sugar and diabetes. It's important to note that the teacher is referring to \\"traditional wisdom,\\" which suggests that this is a commonly held belief rather than a scientifically proven fact. However, it still reinforces the notion that there's a relationship between sugar and diabetes. Looking back at the relevant answer choices, we can rule out \\"+Glucose\\" because it's a component of sugar and not a direct effect or consequence of consuming sugar. Similarly, we can eliminate \\"+Energy\\" because consuming sugar does provide the body with energy, but this isn't explicitly mentioned in the teacher's hints. That leaves us with \\"+diabetes\\" as the best answer choice. While it's true that research has shown that excessive sugar intake can contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes, it's essential to be aware that eating sugar in moderation does not automatically lead to diabetes. Other factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and overall diet, also play a significant role in determining an individual's risk for developing diabetes. In conclusion, based on the hints provided by the teacher, it's most suitable to select \\"+diabetes\\" as the answer to the question \\"Sugar causes.\\" However, it's important to remember that sugar doesn't inherently \\"cause\\" diabetes, but rather, excessive sugar consumption can be a contributing factor in its development when combined with other risk factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They taped two TV appearances, played special gigs at the Apollo Theater and SXSW, and launched a world tour in support of Springsteen's new LP, \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" Late last week, Rolling Stone chatted separately with E Street Band guitarists Steven Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren about the new E Street Band and how they're carrying on after the loss of Clarence Clemons.

Translate to German: The only worry being that February is the rainiest month of the year in Vancouver. German:","completion":"Der einzige Grund zur Sorge ist, dass der Februar der regenreichste Monat des Jahres in Vancouver ist. Step-by-step translation and justification: 1. The only worry -> Der einzige Grund zur Sorge I translated the phrase \\"The only worry\\" into \\"Der einzige Grund zur Sorge\\", which has the same meaning in German. I used \\"zur Sorge\\" which means \\"for concern/worry\\" and \\"Grund\\" which means \\"reason\\". This phrase is common to express an isolated concern in German. 2. being -> ist I translated \\"being\\" into \\"ist\\", which is the third person singular present form of the verb \\"sein\\" (to be) in German. In this case the verb \\"being\\" links the subject \\"the only worry\\" with the complement \\"that February is the rainiest month of the year in Vancouver\\". 3. that -> dass I translated the conjunction \\"that\\" into \\"dass\\" in German, which links the main clause and subordinate clause in the sentence. 4. February -> der Februar I translated \\"February\\" into \\"der Februar\\", which is the German term for the month of February. I also added the definite article \\"der\\" because months take the definite article in German. 5. is the rainiest month -> ist der regenreichste Monat I translated \\"is the rainiest month\\" into \\"ist der regenreichste Monat\\". The superlative of \\"rainy\\" in German is \\"regenreichste\\", which is derived by combining \\"regen\\" (rain) with \\"reich\\" (rich) and adding the superlative ending \\"-ste\\". The noun \\"month\\" is translated as \\"Monat\\" in German, and I added the definite article \\"der\\". 6. of the year -> des Jahres I translated \\"of the year\\" into \\"des Jahres\\", which indicates the relationship between the year and the rainiest month. In German, the genitive construction \\"des Jahres\\" is used to express the meaning \\"of the year\\". It is derived from the noun \\"das Jahr\\" (the year) with its genitive form \\"des Jahres\\". 7. in Vancouver -> in Vancouver The name of the city, Vancouver, remains unchanged in German. I used \\"in\\" as the preposition, which is the same as in English. This further specifies the location where this concern is relevant. Overall, the translated sentence in German is a clear and accurate representation of the given English sentence, conveying the same meaning and information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fox News viewers less informed about current events than those who don’t watch news at all, study finds If Fox News viewers want to be informed about current events, they might as well turn off the TV. A poll released by Fairleigh Dickinson University on Monday found that people who get their news from Fox News know significantly less about news both in the U.S. and the world than people who watch no news at all. In a survey of 612 New Jersey natives, Fox News fans flunked questions about Egypt and Syria when compared with people who don't watch the news. Fox viewers were 18-points less likely to know that Egyptians toppled their government and 6 points less likely to be aware that Syrians have not yet overthrown theirs. \\"Because of the controls for partisanship, we know these results are not just driven by Republicans or other groups being more likely to watch Fox News,\\" Dan Cassino, a Fairleigh Dickinson professor who served as an analyst for the poll, said in the report. \\"Rather, the results show us that there is something about watching Fox News that leads people to do worse on these questions that those who don't watch any news at all.\\" Those surveyed also struggled with current events closer to home. Just 47% were able to identify the Occupy Wall Street protesters as predominantly Democratic, while 11% thought they were Republican. Here it was MSNBC viewers who got it wrong the most - watching the left-leaning network was linked to a 10-point increase in the likelihood of misidentifying the demonstrators. MSNBC viewers did have a 10-point higher chance, however, of correctly identifying Mitt Romney as a frontrunner in the race for a 2012 GOP nominee. Fox News viewers didn't benefit -- or suffer -- in this category, a fact Cassino called \\"very surprising\\" given the amount of attention the network has paid to the candidates. The most informative outlets were found to be the Sunday morning news shows as well as outlets like the New York Times, USA today and NPR. Another powerful source of news was the \\"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.\\" Stewart's viewers had a 12-point higher likelihood of correctly identifying the Wall Street protesters, for example. \\"Jon Stewart has not spent a lot of time on some of these issues,\\" Cassino said. \\"But the results show that when he does talk about something, his viewers pick up a lot more information than they would from other news sources.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"A study conducted by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that Fox News viewers are less informed about current events than those who do not watch any news at all.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: lovers cuddling in a tree on the shore beside lake","completion":"The most salient words in the sentence \\"lovers cuddling in a tree on the shore beside lake\\" are as follows: 1. Lovers - The primary subject of the sentence, emphasizing the romantic connection between two people. When we think of lovers, we often think of intimacy, passion, and the closeness a couple shares. 2. Cuddling - This verb illustrates the physical affection the lovers are sharing in the moment. It paints a picture of warmth, comfort, and a feeling of safety between the couple. 3. Tree - A central element in the scene, as the tree is where the lovers have chosen to nestle together. The tree suggests a sense of nature, tranquility, and perhaps even an element of adventure or playfulness as they climb up or find a spot to cuddle within its branches. 4. Shore - This word indicates the geographical location of the scene, which is on the edge of a body of water. Shores often evoke feelings of relaxation, natural beauty, and a calming atmosphere where people can connect more deeply with each other and their surroundings. 5. Lake - The body of water itself completes the image of this serene and picturesque setting. Lakes are associated with a sense of peace, tranquility, and reflection, which enhances the emotional depth and context of the lovers' meeting spot. Each of these salient words work together to create a vivid and heartwarming picture of two people in love, sharing a special and intimate moment within the embrace of nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. I couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007, it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick. Didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or CGI?!? Didn't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic? Or did I get the purpose wrong, was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal, bound together in the big cycle of life, or a warning to mankind not to mess with Nature, or something like that?? It doesn't really matter, either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts. First of all: the premise is very improbable. If at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye, no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time, that's totally unprofessional. And to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient?! And why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans, and make the victim look like a freak?! By the way, I noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes, couldn't they have waited for such a specimen? The story is lame, it's about this poor guy Aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants, which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf (or at least, that's what I make of it) and then he's being chased by some military men. Especially this last bit is ridiculous. I mean, I can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment (imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight!) but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient, it's beyond me why they're out to kill him. Why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient? (a volunteering soldier maybe??). And why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor Aaron, isn't that a bit steep?! Who the hell are these militaries anyway, I hope not the US army or the government, they behave like psychopaths, walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons, raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy # 1, and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline, like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren, panicking and shooting randomly around. Aaron, for some unfathomable medical reason, feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes. Why would that be??? He suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves. What is this? Are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it's eye-balls?!? And that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red (life-) meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat (can a wolf even DO that??!). The acting (or the lack thereof) didn't help the credibility of all this either: everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls, especially this Indian girl, she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression (vexed) and some disinterested mumblings about the force of Nature, and it beats me why Aaron all of a sudden is all over her (but hey, there probably had to be at least one love-scene!). I really sympathized with actor Cory Monteith, who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face, but they didn't give him much to go with. He has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie, which could have been fun to watch, but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique, Monteith really should leave his shirt on. His (few) killings and attacks are hardly shown, we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and Aaron with some more blood on his face and chest. Not much for a modern sci-fi horror! The only good acting came from Justine Bateman, and I really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady. She did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions, but they made her character a kind of a wimp, who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries. What a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more! In the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie, hardly scary or thrilling, with unbelievable goings-on, a lot of overlong National Geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes (who cares?!?), some pretentious Indian ramblings about Man and Nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments.

Joined by six other priests, DeCarlo plans to kill Damien while finding the Christ Child. Meanwhile, Damien becomes romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow). Learning of his assassins and taking out all but DeCarlo over time, he proceeds to mold Reynolds's young son Peter (Barnaby Holm) into a disciple by playing on the boy's desire for a father figure. After the alignment of stars in the Cassiopeia constellation on March 24, 1982, generating what is described as a second Star of Bethlehem, Damien realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming and orders his followers to kill all boys born in England on the morning of March 24, 1982 to prevent the Christ Child's return to power. A week after a string of thirty one infant deaths, Reynolds encounters DeCarlo as he reveals Damien's true identity to her while giving her evidence of the murders. The next day, Damien rapes and sodomises Reynolds. The following morning Reynolds discovers Damien's birthmark. Damien tells Peter to follow DeCarlo, resulting in Damien learning that his advisor, Harvey Dean, had concealed the date of his son's birth when Peter reports DeCarlo visiting Dean's wife Barbara and revealing her husband's role in the infant murders. Dean refuses to kill his son and makes preparations to flee the country, only to return home and be killed by his wife,...

Article: You can love them or hate them, but no matter which tourist destination you visit, chances are you'll see someone with their head buried in a Lonely Planet guidebook. Lonely Planet is one of the world's largest travel guide brands, publishing more than 500 different guides in eight languages.The popular brand also produces television shows, websites and podcasts all devoted to travel. Some people praise Lonely Planet books because they make traveling easy and affordable.They also save time and make sure you don't miss the best things. They also provide the reviews of hostels, hotels, restaurants and ticket information about your destination. This can be great if you're a nervous traveler, or if you haven't traveled by yourself before.If you're in a country where you don't speak the language, sometimes there's nothing better than getting into a taxi and opening up a guidebook.You simply point to a map that directs the taxi driver to a hostel that's cheap and clean, with friendly staff and cold beer. But others criticize Lonely Planet and other travel guide publishers like them.They say guidebooks take the fun and spontaneity out of traveling, and that part of the enjoyment of travel comes from the fact that anything can happen.They also regret that if you follow a guidebook, you'll end up doing the same thing and having the same experience as everyone else.You might end up seeing the same group of people over and over, because everyone is reading the same book and following the same route. Another criticism of travel guides is that they have a large impact on local communities.For example, some locals devote their lives to behaving in ways that attract tourists.They pretend to live a traditional lifestyle, wear traditional clothes and live in traditional houses in order to attract the tourist dollar.

Question: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the spaceship Icarus II, with the intent to jump start the sun, and return to Earth. As they pass Mercury's orbit, Icarus II discovers the distress beacon of Icarus I, the first ship to attempt their mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two bombs have a better chance of success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer Icarus I. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates a trajectory to intercept Icarus I, but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to several shield panels. Kaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by Pilot Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from the sun. The angle however allows the sun to destroys the ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves. As Icarus II's autopilot returns the shield to its original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to safety and repairs the last panel, moments before he's immolated. Trey blames himself for the loss of Kaneda, and psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk, sedating him. Icarus II docks with Icarus I. Capa, Searle, Mace, and now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board Icarus II. They discover Icarus I's mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of Icarus I is found charred to death in the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the un-shielded sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying Icarus I's outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. Mace suggests one crew member stay behind to manually operate the airlock while the other three jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle volunteers to stay behind.

A flashback shows that Pitka was an orphan, taught by Guru Tugginmypudha. When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a Guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others.

A woman being sued over her 1million shoe collection says she is 'relieved' after her ex-husband dropped his legal battle. Hedge fund manager Daniel Shak, 52,. was fighting to win 35 per cent of the value of ex-wife Beth's 1,200. luxury shoes, but yesterday dropped the case. Poker champion Mrs Shak, 42, gave six. hours of testimony at Montgomery County Courthouse near Philadelphia. before Mr Shak suddenly stopped his legal action against. her. She said: 'Daniel knew he was going to lose. I'm so relieved that he saw sense and decided to give up on this. It was so stupid.' Surrounded: Beth Shak with some of her 1,200 pairs of designer heels. She claims it was an obsession bordering on illness. Substitute for love: Mrs Shak said 'There was such a lack of emotion and love in my relationship that I filled that void with shopping... I couldn't stop' She hit the headlines last month when. Mr Shak accused her of hiding around 1million worth of designer shoes. in a 'secret room' of their Fifth Avenue apartment during their divorce. three years ago. She has. more than 1,200 pairs of shoes, kept in a number of closets that need a. PIN code to enter - and even has a tattoo of a Louboutin heel on her. hip. She told Judge Ronda Daniele that a lack of love in her marriage drove. her to seek gratification in shopping, spending hundreds of thousands on. shoes that she then often simply gave away. In an interview with the New York Post, Mrs Shak said: 'It really was a sickness... like a disease. 'There was such a lack of emotion and. love in my relationship that I filled that void with shopping. I was. shopping endlessly, I couldn’t stop.' Beth is working on her new shoe website, Shoes R Forever, which was inspired by her new boyfriend Ben Cook. No longer pursuing: Daniel Shak instructed his lawyer to drop the lawsuit over the shoes yesterday. Mr Shak had claimed that he did not know the extent of her shoe collection. But Mrs Shak told the court that her. former husband not only knew about the shoes but signed off on all the. bills for them. She also told the court that it was her husband's. disinterest in their relationship that drove her into retail therapy in. the first place. When asked about the collection, she. told judge Ronda Daniele: 'I would not call these shoes a collection, I. would call them a sickness at a particular point in my life.' When Mr Shak suddenly instructed his. lawyer to withdraw the lawsuit, Judge Daniele said: 'Well, thanks for. wasting everybody's time.' Outside the court, Mrs Shak to the. Post: 'I wanted love and emotional support and affection, but there was. nothing... He would always say, \\"I’m busy. Leave me alone. Just go. shopping or something\\". And I would give in and just go do it. 'God only knows how many pairs of shoes I’ve bought in a week.' Mr Shak's lawsuit. against his ex-wife stated: ‘In the summer of 2011, Daniel became. aware that Beth owned and failed to disclose an extensive … collection. of Christian Louboutin shoes … and other high-end designer shoes. ‘Dan. trusted his wife and was not inspecting his home to try to find. inventory or “secret rooms’’.’ The collection is indeed vast and. includes 700 pairs of Louboutins, costing from 700 to 4,000. That,. combined with her reputation as a World Series poker player, has made. Mrs Shak something of a celebrity in the U.S. She has appeared on. television to discuss her shoe habit, and is starting to design her own. range of footwear. Beth Shak with her boyfriend Ben Cook, 36 and part of her shoe collection. Mrs Shak’s most expensive shoes are a pair of. black and white cowboy boots once owned by Elizabeth Taylor.

She now lives in a house near Philadelphia with her. two youngest children Lindy, 17, and Austin, 15 – and has four storage. areas around the property for all her footwear.

She said: ‘There are shoes that I don’t even remember. buying. I’m so short of space I had to give a couple of hundred pairs. away.'","completion":"A woman being sued over her 1 million shoe collection expresses relief as her ex-husband drops his legal battle. Hedge fund manager Daniel Shak was fighting to win 35% of ex-wife Beth's 1,200 luxury shoes' value but dropped the case after her testimony. Beth Shak, a Poker champion, gave six hours of testimony at the Montgomery County Courthouse near Philadelphia before her ex-husband ceased his legal actions against her. She believes Daniel knew he was going to lose the case. Beth Shak became the center of attention after her ex-husband accused her of hiding about 1 million worth of designer shoes in a secret room in their Fifth Avenue apartment during their divorce three years ago. Her shoe collection includes over 1,200 pairs, stored in multiple closets requiring a PIN code to enter. She also has a tattoo of a Louboutin heel on her hip. Beth told Judge Ronda Daniele that the lack of love in her marriage drove her to seek gratification in shopping, spending hundreds of thousands on shoes she would often give away. She admitted that her shoe obsession was like a sickness due to the lack of emotion and love in her relationship. Beth is currently working on her new shoe website, Shoes R Forever, inspired by her boyfriend Ben Cook. During the case, Beth Shak insisted that her ex-husband was fully aware of her shoe collection and had even signed off on the bills for them. She claimed it was his disinterest in their relationship that led her to resort to retail therapy. After Daniel Shak suddenly instructed his lawyer to withdraw the lawsuit, Judge Daniele remarked, \\"Well, thanks for wasting everybody's time.\\" Beth Shak stated that all she ever wanted was love and emotional support, but her husband continuously pushed her to go shopping because he was always too busy to offer any affection. Her shoe collection is vast, including 700 pairs of Christian Louboutin shoes and footwear from other high-end designers, costing between 700 to 4,000 per pair. Beth Shak, now a minor celebrity in the U.S., has appeared on television discussing her shoe habit and is starting to design her range of footwear. Beth Shak's most expensive shoes are a pair of black and white cowboy boots once owned by Elizabeth Taylor. She keeps them in a separate glass cabinet and has four storage areas around her Pennsylvania property for her expansive footwear collection. Despite having limited space for her shoes, she admitted that she had given away hundreds of pairs because she couldn't remember buying them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the mean time Nina had told the story of her love to her father, and the effect on Balatka had simply been that he had not got out of his bed since. For himself he would have cared, perhaps, but little as to the Jewish marriage, had he not known that those belonging to him would have cared so much. He had no strong religious prejudice of his own, nor indeed had he strong feeling of any kind. He loved his daughter, and wished her well; but even for her he had been unable to exert himself in his younger days, and now simply expected from her hands all the comfort which remained to him in this world. The priest he knew would attack him, and to the priest he would be able to make no answer. But to Trendellsohn, Jew as he was, he would trust in worldly matters, rather than to the Zamenoys; and were it not that he feared the Zamenoys, and could not escape from his close connection with them, he would have been half inclined to let the girl marry the Jew. Souchey, indeed, had frightened him on the subject when it had first been mentioned to him; and Nina, coming with her own assurance so quickly after Souchey's suspicion, had upset him; but his feeling in regard to Nina had none of that bitter anger, no touch of that abhorrence which animated the breast of his sister-in-law. When Ziska came to him he was alone in his bedroom.

A loner and introvert by nature, Don refuses to socialize with the colorful and quirky locals. One day, Don receives a pink letter – an oddity in a sea of white envelopes. Intrigued by the mysterious sender, he opens the letter to find an invitation to a masquerade ball at the enigmatic, historic mansion that overlooks the town. Against his instincts, Don decides to attend the ball, hoping he might find some inspiration to fuel his writing. Upon arrival, he discovers that the theme of the ball is \\"Color Your Destiny\\" and party-goers are dressed in various colors, each representing a unique personality trait. However, Don shows up in an all-black outfit with only the pink letter in hand. Throughout the night, he encounters various eccentric characters, each one subtly urging him to reveal the reason behind his attendance and what the pink letter symbolizes. Don finds himself drawn to a woman in a beautiful pink gown, but she always seems to vanish into the crowd just as he's about to approach her. As the night progresses, Don begins to uncover hidden clues that point to a secret buried deep within the town's history. The mansion's owner, a skilled painter, had his heart shattered and ultimately took his own life after being betrayed by his lover. It was rumored that before his death, he had painted a message that would lead to hidden treasure, and the key to uncovering it was through his paintings of letters – the last of which was the pink letter that mysteriously arrived in Don's mailbox. Driven by curiosity and enamored by the woman in pink, Don dives deep into the town's past and unravels the truth behind the painter's tragic demise. Through his investigation, he searches for the origin of the enigmatic pink letter. Along the way, he finds that the true message is not about material treasure, but the realization that love and hope can heal even the most broken souls. In the climactic scene, as the clock strikes midnight, Don finally comes face-to-face with the woman in pink. She reveals that she is a descendant of the painter and has been searching for the truth all her life. The pink letter was sent by her to draw Don into her journey, as she had read his previous books and knew that together they would solve the mystery. United by their shared purpose, they confess their feelings for each other and decide to embark on a new journey - together, hand in hand. And so, the once-reclusive Don finds love, inspiration, and a sense of belonging within the close-knit town that he once shunned, all thanks to the enigma of the pink letter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Ricketts Glen State Park is in the Susquehanna River drainage basin, the earliest recorded inhabitants of which were the Iroquoian-speaking Susquehannocks. Their numbers were greatly reduced by disease and warfare with the Five Nations of the Iroquois, and by 1675 they had died out, moved away, or been assimilated into other tribes. After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park. After the American Revolutionary War, Native Americans almost entirely left Pennsylvania.

As the troops face the harsh realities of war and uncertainty, Courcey's inner strength illuminates the importance of loyalty, friendship, and the power of the human spirit. Act 1: The Brotherhood Forms The film begins with a series of brief scenes establishing the main characters who are a diverse group of British soldiers. We're introduced to Courcey, a charismatic and skilled sergeant with a genuine care for his fellow soldiers. As the men begin their training, Courcey quickly earns the respect of his comrades through his leadership and acts of kindness. During a night-time raid exercise, a young soldier named Aiden injures his leg after stepping into a concealed hole. Despite facing criticism for slowing down the team, Courcey insists on carrying Aiden over his shoulder for the remainder of the exercise. This act of courage and loyalty cements Courcey as the cornerstone of the unit. Act 2: The War Rages On As World War II intensifies, the soldiers are deployed to the European frontlines. The men encounter several life-threatening battles and their camaraderie is pushed to the limit as they face life and death decisions on a daily basis. Throughout the chaos, Courcey's unwavering commitment to not leave behind any wounded soldiers becomes legendary. At the climax of a particularly brutal battle, a member of the unit, Steve, is critically injured by a nearby explosion. He falls into a shell hole, completely exposed to enemy fire. Courcey, knowing the risks, rushes to Steve's aid and manages to bring him back to cover despite taking fire from the enemy. Act 3: The Final Battle The unit is tasked with rescuing captured soldiers being held in a heavily guarded German POW camp. As they reach the camp, the soldiers confront the German troops in their most ferocious battle yet. Outnumbered, the unit is at the brink of defeat as the enemy soldiers advance. As more soldiers from their unit fall, Aiden, Steve, and a handful of survivors fortify a position near the injured. With heavy mortar fire and relentless enemy troops closing in, the men must make the most difficult decision - evacuate and save themselves or stay and fight to protect their wounded comrades. Act 4: The Unbreakable Bond Prevails Courcey, knowing the odds of survival have significantly decreased, gathers the remaining soldiers for a final stand. Their intense loyalty to each other, fueled by Courcey's unwavering devotion to no man left behind, powers the men to fight with everything they have. As the enemy advances, each soldier displays extraordinary courage, picking off enemy soldiers one by one. Courcey leads the charge, fighting beside his brothers-in-arms. The unit slowly turns the tide of the battle, ultimately leading to an unexpected air support that decimates the remaining German forces. Epilogue: Returning Home With the camp liberated, Courcey and his surviving soldiers return to England as heroes. Their story of brotherhood, sacrifice, and perseverance defines a legacy that lives on in the hearts and minds of their fellow countrymen. Recognized for their valor, each member of the unit is awarded prestigious military honors. Courcey's devotion to his comrades and the bond they formed become a symbol of hope and inspiration, living on as a beacon of human spirit for future generations of soldiers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A police officer, also known as a policewoman, policeman, police agent is a warranted law employee of a police force. In the United States, \\"officer\\" usually is the formal name of the lowest police rank. In many other countries, \\"officer\\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank, and the lowest rank is often \\"constable\\". In some nations the use of the rank \\"officer\\" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of criminals and the prevention and detection of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some police officers may also be trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to dissimulate as ordinary citizens. - Special police (also see Auxiliary police) usually describes a police force or unit within a police force whose duties and responsibilities are significantly different from other forces in the same country or from other police in the same force, although there is no consistent international definition. A special constable, in most cases, is not a member of a special police force; in countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and often elsewhere, a special constable is a voluntary or part-time member of a national or local police force or a person involved in law enforcement who is not a police officer but has some of the powers of a police officer. - Concurrent jurisdiction exists where two or more courts from different systems simultaneously have jurisdiction over a specific case. This situation leads to forum shopping, as parties will try to have their civil or criminal case heard in the court that they perceive will be most favorable to them. - Community Safety Accreditation Schemes are a means by which the Chief Constable of a police force in the United Kingdom may grant a limited range of police powers to employees of non-police organisations who contribute towards community safety. Community Safety Accreditation Schemes were created under section 40 of the Police Reform Act 2002. Individuals who have been granted these powers are known under the Act as Accredited Persons. - In criminal justice, particularly in North America, correction, corrections, and correctional, are umbrella terms describing a variety of functions typically carried out by government agencies, and involving the punishment, treatment, and supervision of persons who have been convicted of crimes. These functions commonly include imprisonment, parole and probation. A typical \\"correctional institution\\" is a prison. A \\"correctional system\\", also known as a \\"penal system\\", thus refers to a network of agencies that administer a jurisdiction's prisons and community-based programs like parole and probation boards;. This system is part of the larger criminal justice system, which additionally includes police, prosecution and courts. Jurisdictions throughout Canada and the US have ministries or departments, respectively, of corrections, correctional services, or similarly-named agencies. - Michele Marie Leonhart ( born February 27 , 1956 ) is an American career law enforcement officer and the former Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . After the resignation of Administrator Karen P. Tandy in the fall of 2007 , Leonhart also served as Acting Administrator of the DEA . On February 2 , 2010 , President Barack Obama nominated Leonhart for the position of DEA Administrator . Leonhart 's tenure as DEA Administrator was marked with controversy and scandals including a prostitution scandal ; by the end of her service in April 2015 , she was labelled \`\` embattled '' when a bipartisan group of lawmakers declared that they had no confidence in her leadership . On April 21 , she conveyed to Attorney General Eric Holder that she intended to resign the following month . - In the United States, a special agent is usually a detective or investigator for a state, county, municipal, federal, or tribal government who primarily serve in investigatory roles. Within the United States' federal law enforcement system, dozens of federal agencies employ federal law enforcement officers, each with different criteria pertaining to the use of the titles \\"\\"Special Agent\\"\\" versus \\"\\"Agent\\"\\". In intelligence usage, agent refers to one who is recruited, trained, controlled and employed to obtain and report information. - The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) is the statute establishing federal U.S. drug policy under which the manufacture, importation, possession, use and distribution of certain substances is regulated. It was passed by the 91st United States Congress as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 and signed into law by President Richard Nixon. The Act also served as the national implementing legislation for the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is a United States federal law enforcement agency under the U.S. Department of Justice, tasked with combating drug smuggling and use within the United States. The DEA is the lead agency for domestic enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act, sharing concurrent jurisdiction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security, and the U.S. Border Patrol. It has sole responsibility for coordinating and pursuing U.S. drug investigations both domestic, and abroad. - The role of Immigration officers is to ensure that immigration legislation is enforced. This can cover the rules of entry for visa applicants, foreign nationals or those seeking asylum at the border, detecting and apprehending those that have breached the border and removing them, or pursuing those in breach of immigration and criminal laws. - Parole officers and probation officers play a role in the criminal justice systems by supervising offenders released from incarceration or sentenced to non-custodial sanctions such as community service. In some jurisdictions parole or probation officers are involved in presenting reports on offenders and making sentencing recommendation to courts of law. - Barack Hussein Obama II (; born August 4, 1961) is an American politician who served as the 44th President of the United States from 2009 to 2017. He was the first African American to serve as president, as well as the first born outside the contiguous United States. He previously served in the U.S. Senate representing Illinois from 2005 to 2008, and in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004. - Homeland security is an American umbrella term for \\"the national effort to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, aspirations, and ways of life can thrive to the national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the U.S. to terrorism, and minimize the damage from attacks that do occur.\\" - The Federal Bureau of Investigation, or FBI, is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States, which simultaneously serves as the nation's prime federal law enforcement agency. Operating under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI is concurrently a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and reports to both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence. A leading U.S. counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and criminal investigative organization, the FBI has jurisdiction over violations of more than 200 categories of federal crimes. - A law enforcement officer (LEO) or peace officer, in North American English, is a public-sector employee whose duties primarily involve the enforcement of laws. The phrase can include police officers, municipal law enforcement officers, special police officers, customs officers, state troopers, special agents, special investigators, border patrol officers, immigration officers, court officers, probation officers, parole officers, arson investigators, auxiliary officers, game wardens, sheriffs, corrections, marshals, and deputies. Security guards are civilians and therefore not law enforcement officers, unless they have been granted powers to enforce particular laws, such as those accredited under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme. Although typically the term \\"law enforcement officer\\" refers to those government agents with police powers, prosecutors are also law enforcement officers. - A sheriff is a government official, with varying duties, existing in some countries with historical ties to England, where the office originated. There is an analogous although independently developed office in Iceland that is commonly translated to English as \\"sheriff,\\" and this is discussed below. - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics. - An officer is a person who has a position of authority in a hierarchical organization. - The President of the United States (POTUS) is the elected head of state and head of government of the United States. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.

He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso. His time there reportedly helped form his support for citizenship for undocumented immigrants in the United States – a stance likely to attract Latino voters. He also learned to speak fluent Spanish, seen as a possible advantage with Hispanic voters. At Harvard, Kaine met his wife, Anne Holton, the daughter of former Republican Virginia Governor Linwood Holton (1970-74), who desegregated the commonwealth's public schools. She now serves as Virginia's secretary of education. They have three children.

Though designed to help teams adjust to the loss of television revenues (the average Premier League team receives £55 million while the average Football League Championship club receives £2 million), critics maintain that the payments actually widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not, leading to the common occurrence of teams \\"bouncing back\\" soon after their relegation.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"a rubber band snapping causes the particles in the rubber band to\\" is \\"loose\\", given that a rubber band snapping causes the particles in the rubber band to Heat ? Answer:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"a rubber band snapping causes the particles in the rubber band to\\" is not \\"loose\\" when considering that a rubber band snapping causes the particles in the rubber band to heat. When a rubber band snaps, the particles (or polymer chains) within the rubber band undergo a transformation in their arrangement and energy state. In more detail, here is what occurs: 1. When a rubber band is stretched, the polymer chains align in the direction of tension, leading to an increase in its potential energy. 2. When the rubber band snaps, the potential energy stored in the aligned polymer chains is quickly converted into kinetic energy. 3. The rapid release of energy causes the particles in the rubber band to vibrate. This increased molecular vibration is experienced as heat, which raises the temperature of the rubber band. 4. After snapping, the broken rubber band's particles may also take on a more random arrangement, returning to their relaxed state. In this case, the answer to the question should be \\"heat\\" or \\"gain kinetic energy and generate heat,\\" as they better reflect the changes the rubber band's particles undergo when it snaps."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God\\", apart from the solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" they are heard only in \\"Hallelujah\\" and the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \\"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\\". In \\"Glory to God\\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \\"quietly, from afar\\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance. In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \\"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\\" according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \\"an aspiration towards D major\\", the key musically associated with light and glory.

Options: - use glass - open mouth - eat first - buy alcohol - coffee mug Explain why a human would choose \\"use glass\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"use glass\\" to answer the question above because it is the most polite and appropriate option for drinking a beverage amongst the given choices. Using a glass as a vessel for drinking is considered proper etiquette as it provides a clean, convenient, and visually appealing container designed explicitly for consuming liquids. Here is a breakdown of why the other options are not as suitable: 1. Open mouth: Drinking with an open mouth directly from a container, such as a bottle or pitcher, is considered impolite and unsanitary. It also lacks the refined presentation that using a glass offers. 2. Eat first: Eating before drinking is not necessarily impolite, but it does not address the original question about the appropriate vessel for drinking. This option is more about timing rather than the method of consumption. 3. Buy alcohol: This option is unrelated to the politeness of drinking and does not provide a suitable vessel for consuming a beverage. Choosing to buy alcohol or not is a personal preference and not an answer to the question of how to drink politely. 4. Coffee mug: While a coffee mug is a perfectly acceptable container for drinking certain beverages, such as hot tea or coffee, it is not the universal solution for all drinks. Using a glass is more versatile and visually appealing for a broader range of beverages, making it the best choice when considering the question of achieving politeness in drinking. In conclusion, using a glass is considered the most polite and practical vessel according to social norms and etiquette for consuming beverages. It offers a clean, dedicated container that enhances the drinking experience and is visually appealing, making it the optimal choice amongst the provided options."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Though this was its most popular period, the music had actually been around since the late 1920s and early 1930s, being played by black bands led by such artists as Duke Ellington, Jimmie Lunceford, Bennie Moten, Cab Calloway, and Fletcher Henderson, and white bands from the 1920s led by the likes of Russ Morgan and Isham Jones. The era's beginning is sometimes dated from the King of Swing Benny Goodman's performance at the Palomar Ballroom in Los Angeles on August 21, 1935, bringing the music to the rest of the country. 1930s also became the era of other great soloists: the tenor saxist Coleman Hawkins and Chu Berry; the alto saxists Benny Carter and Johnny Hodges; the drummers Gene Krupa, Cozy Cole and Sid Catlett; the pianists Fats Waller and Teddy Wilson; the trumpeters Roy Eldridge, Bunny Berigan, and Rex Stewart. - A Hole in the Head ( 1959 ) is a comedy film directed by Frank Capra , featuring Frank Sinatra , Edward G.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In its depiction of a miserable Milanese underclass, this film was probably quite revealing in its day. However, I get the feeling that neorealism was never really director De Sica's bag, since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country. After spending most of his childhood in an orphanage, Toto ends up living in a shantytown in Milan. He organises the inhabitants into community action, and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables. That nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me, as these people have far more important things to think about, like where the next Pot Noodle is going to come from. Anyway, De Sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are. It's all down to capitalism of course, and in order to illustrate this, he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land. Brilliant! To his credit, though, by this time he has given up on making a serious film, and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures, all fur coats and cigars. They want that land, but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense. By a bizarre stroke of luck, his old, deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove. He uses it to shower gifts on his mates, who prove just as greedy as the cigar men. I reckon this film was a missed opportunity. To address the theme of poverty , as not many film-makers had done until then, and then get caught up in a fairy tale, to me seems a bit daft. How come 'great' directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here? Hans Christian Anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the Milan Duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks. De Sica, however, is proclaimed as a genius for this. Surely the fact that these people are so poor, that their faith is unswerving, and that miracles never happen to them, is enough for any story-teller to work on.

Pincus cannot fight his feelings, and begins to really pursue Gwen. She seems receptive, but Pincus' harsh personality turns her off. Is there any possibility that Pincus can control his natural urges of prickly character flaws to win over the fair Gwen or will she be forever turned off? It would figure that it would take something major to happen to make her heart warm towards himself. This is when Pincus accidentally gets hit by a bus, in almost the same way that her deceased husband Frank had.

Article: The earth is 4 600 million years old. We humans have lived on earth for only 35 000 years, but during this period we have changed our planet a lot in many ways. Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \\"ozone\\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \\"blanket\\" around the earth. The heat from the sun can't escape so the temperature is rising. This is called \\"the greenhouse effect\\". It causes the level of the oceans to rise and the climate of the earth to change. All these problems are very serious, so we must do something now. ,A, B, C, D.

Say this using Spanish","completion":"\\"Con la llegada del Espíritu, nace todo lo grandioso.\\" Esta frase en español, que se traduce literalmente como \\"Con la llegada del Espíritu, nace todo lo grandioso\\", sugiere que cuando el Espíritu (ya sea divino, humano o simplemente una fuerza vital) llega a nuestras vidas, se crea la posibilidad de que surjan cosas maravillosas y extraordinarias. En este contexto, el Espíritu puede representar diversas cosas según el punto de vista personal y las creencias de cada uno, pero en última instancia, simboliza una fuerza poderosa y transformadora que puede impulsar cambios positivos y un crecimiento notable tanto en nuestra vida individual como colectiva. Esta idea del Espíritu como fuente de grandeza y cambio positivo es común en muchas culturas y tradiciones espirituales en todo el mundo. En el cristianismo, el Espíritu Santo es considerado tanto un guía como un consolador; en el hinduismo y el budismo, el concepto de Atman o el \\"Yo supremo\\" representa una chispa divina presente en cada ser. Además, en muchas tradiciones indígenas y paganas, los espíritus de la naturaleza o los antepasados juegan un papel crucial en la dirección y el apoyo en momentos de crisis o transición en la vida. Por lo tanto, la idea de que todo lo grandioso en nuestra existencia proviene de la presencia y la acción del Espíritu es una creencia ampliamente compartida y atesorada en la historia humana. Entendiendo esto, podemos reflexionar sobre cómo se manifiesta el Espíritu en nuestras propias vidas, y cómo podemos estar abiertos a su influencia y guía. A través del autoconocimiento, la autoexploración y la práctica de la atención plena, podemos aprender a detectar y agradecer las muchas maneras en que el Espíritu nos guía en nuestra búsqueda de significado y propósito. Al hacerlo, permitimos que las cosas extraordinarias y grandiosas surjan de nuestros proyectos, relaciones y experiencias, y nos abrimos a la posibilidad de un crecimiento constante y un aprendizaje profundo, tanto en lo personal como en lo colectivo. Por otro lado, también es importante reconocer que la llegada del Espíritu a nuestras vidas es un proceso dinámico y que no siempre es lineal. Pueden existir momentos en los que nos sentimos desconectados de esa fuente inmensa de inspiración y grandeza, pero eso no significa que el Espíritu haya dejado de estar presente en nuestra vida. En estos momentos de confusión o desesperanza, es especialmente crucial recordar nuestra conexión esencial con el Espíritu y buscar activamente formas de reavivarlo en nuestro interior y en nuestras acciones. De hecho, es en estos momentos de oscuridad cuando el Espíritu puede revelar sus lecciones más profundas, al mostrarnos que incluso en medio del sufrimiento y la incertidumbre, somos capaces de crecer y descubrir nuevas facetas de nuestra verdadera naturaleza. En resumen, la frase \\"Con la llegada del Espíritu, nace todo lo grandioso\\" es una afirmación poderosa que nos recuerda de nuestra conexión esencial con una fuerza vital más grande y transformadora presente dentro y fuera de nosotros. A través de la apertura a la influencia y la guía del Espíritu, podemos aprender a cultivar un sentido de grandeza y plenitud en nuestras vidas, y a percibir las muchas maneras en que esta presencia divina nos sostiene y nos inspira en nuestro camino."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The recommendation was based on documented cases of widespread and systematic human rights violations, including the use of excessive force, torture, and enforced disappearances. Instances of arbitrary detention and attacks on civilian populations were also cited as grounds for referral. The United Nations' involvement in Syria reflects a growing international concern over the country's escalating violence and the Assad regime's disregard for basic human rights. The UN's intervention is seen as a necessary step in protecting those who have been caught in the crossfire and to hold those responsible for these violations accountable. In addition to the humanitarian mission, multiple strategies for resolution are being considered by the international community. These measures include economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and, in extreme cases, possible military intervention to enforce a ceasefire and ensure the implementation of reforms. The United Nations and other international organizations, such as the Arab League and the European Union, have issued strong statements condemning the Syrian government's actions, urging for an end to the violence and a peaceful transition towards democracy. The humanitarian mission's findings will play a crucial role in shaping the international community's response to the crisis and determining the next steps to be taken. It is essential that investigators on the ground gather accurate and comprehensive information regarding the human rights abuses being perpetrated, as well as assessing the humanitarian situation in areas that have been most severely affected. This data will be critical in informing the development of strategies to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and to ensure that those responsible for the ongoing atrocities are held accountable. Ultimately, the situation in Syria is complex and fraught with challenges. However, by conducting a thorough analysis of the current state of affairs and working in concert with international partners, the United Nations has the potential to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the lives of those affected by the ongoing crisis.

Summarize this article: Pope Francis waves at faithfuls upon his arrival at St.Peter’s square for the weekly general audience on March 5, 2014 AFP/Getty Images Thursday is the one-year anniversary of Pope Francis’s election, and the 266th pope remains as popular as ever. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds 55% hold a positive view of the pope, compared to just 7% who hold a negative view. About a quarter of Americans didn’t have an opinion. His popularity has held steady in recent months, but has skyrocketed since last July, when 35% said they viewed the pope positively. Pope Francis has fared far better than his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, who had a 30% approval rating when he left office in February. The pope consistently ranks better among more educated Americans, with 66% of people who had received a postgraduate degree saying they viewed him positively, compared with 48% of those who had completed some or all of high school. Democrats are also fonder of the pope than Republicans or independents are. Some 62% of Democrats said they viewed Pope Francis positively, compared with 53% of Republicans and 41% of independents. Since his election, the pope has drawn significant media attention with his personal warmth and his efforts to set a new tone for the Catholic Church. Last week, a media firestorm ensued when, in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, the pope said the church must evaluate gay civil unions, though he maintained that marriage is between a man and a woman. Last September, he remarked that the church had grown “obsessed” with abortion, gay marriage and contraception and called for a “new balance” in the church. A strong majority of Catholics have also responded positively to Pope Francis, with 60% saying they agreed with the statement, “Pope Francis has renewed and strengthened my religious faith and commitment to the Catholic Church”—compared to 31% who said they disagreed. Women were far more likely than men to agree with that statement, with 70% reporting they did, compared with 50% of men. Older Catholics were also more likely to feel renewed faith than younger ones, with 61% of Catholics over the age of 61 saying they agreed with the statement, compared to 51% of Catholics aged 18 to 34. The WSJ/NBC poll, which surveyed 1,000 adults March 5 to 9, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

His predecessor, Benedict XVI, had resigned the month before, citing a decline in his physical and mental strength, leading to an almost unprecedented handover of power. After the remote, intellectual German theologian came the church's first Jesuit leader, its first Latin American pontiff – and the first pope to take the name of Francis. The pope was elected with a mandate to shake up the church in Rome and help turn the page on an increasingly fraught and scandal-bedevilled papacy. His many fans argue he has vigorously pursued a reformist agenda within the Vatican while radically improving the church's image outside it. But, as Rome marks his first anniversary, just how successful has this peculiarly popular pontiff been? Good works Image management Pope Francis blesses Vinicio Riva in November. Photograph: Claudio Peri/EPA Talk of the \\"Pope Francis effect\\" is ubiquitous for a reason: since stepping out on to the balcony of St Peter's on the evening of 13 March 2013 to joke that the cardinal-electors had been forced to cast their nets to \\"the end of the Earth\\" to find a successor to Benedict, Jorge Mario Bergoglio has scarcely put a humbly shod foot wrong PR-wise. Despite adhering to church teaching as closely as his predecessor, Francis has, through a mixture of charm, humour and openness, turned many preconceptions – and prejudices – on their heads. His decision to abjure the splendour of the apostolic palace in favour of the modest Casa Santa Marta guesthouse has offered proof of his personal commitment to a humbler church, while his tender embracing of Vinicio Riva, a man terribly disfigured by tumours, underlined his hands-on pastoral approach. Such actions saw him voted person of the year by both Time magazine and the US gay and lesbian magazine The Advocate, while his Twitter account - @pontifex – has almost 3.8 million followers. Church governance Francis's decision to appoint eight \\"outsider\\" cardinals to advise him on church reform was described by one observer as the \\"most important step in the history of the church for the past 10 centuries\\". The council, which includes cardinals from the US, Australia, India, Honduras and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, has inevitably been dubbed the papal G8. \\"[They are] not courtiers but wise people who share my feelings,\\" said Francis, who has often been scathing about the \\"introspective and Vatican-centric\\" nature of the Holy See. \\"This is the start of a church with not just a vertical but horizontal organisation.\\" Jesuits, who have had to wait almost 500 years to see one of their number sit on the papal throne, proudly point out that consultation is one of the foundations of their order. Overhaul of the Congregation for Bishops Pope Francis meets bishops at the end of his weekly general audience, in St Peter's Square last month. Photograph: Alessandra Tarantino/AP As well as assembling his own G8, Francis has revamped the powerful Congregation for Bishops, the Vatican department responsible for selecting bishops. By appointing 12 new members and not confirming 14 existing members, he rebalanced the department to make it more moderate and progressive. Among those who were not confirmed was the highly influential conservative US cardinal Raymond Burke, who has been an outspoken critic of US presidential candidates who are in favour of abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, human cloning and same-sex marriage. New members include Vincent Nichols, the leader of Catholics in England and Wales praised for his pastoral and inclusive style, whom Francis made a cardinal last month. The papal historian Michael Walsh described the overhaul of the congregation as a \\"tectonic shift\\" in governance. Inclusivity On Maundy Thursday 2013, a fortnight after becoming pope, Francis exhorted his priests to abandon introspection and to get out \\"to the outskirts where there is suffering, bloodshed, blindness that longs for sight and prisoners in thrall to many evil masters\\". He washed and kissed the feet of two Muslims – one a woman – at a youth detention centre near Rome. It was the first time a pontiff had included women in the ceremony. For many, the greatest proof of the pope's commitment to inclusivity and his desire to appeal to those who have long felt ignored or criticised by the church came during an impromptu press conference on a flight back from Brazil in July. \\"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has goodwill, who am I to judge?\\" he asked journalists. Anglican relations Francis's determination to \\"intensify dialogue among the various religions\\" has not been confined to reaching out to Jews and Muslims. Last June, he had lunch with the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the pair chatted for four hours. Despite frosty relations that have existed between the churches in recent years – caused mainly by the C of E's decision to ordain women and Pope Benedict's creation of an ordinariate to bring disaffected Anglicans into the embrace of Rome – Francis and Welby appear to have a genuine rapport. According to Sir David Moxon, the archbishop of Canterbury's representative to the Holy See and director of the Anglican centre in Rome, there was an \\"immediate chemistry\\" between the two leaders, whom Moxon describes as \\"men of action\\" equally committed to tackling poverty and social injustice. It has not hurt that Welby's personal spiritual director is a Benedictine monk; nor that the archbishop recently signalled a further rapprochement by inviting members of a Roman Catholic ecumenical community to take up residence in Lambeth Palace.

Photograph: AFP It was no accident that Francis chose a career Vatican diplomat, Pietro Parolin, as his secretary of state, a position often likened to the papal prime minister. The pope has shown a desire to put the Vatican back on the international stage as a key player in external – not just messy, internal – affairs, and his stance on Syria has been the clearest sign that under him the Catholic church's voice will be loud and clear. With an open letter to the leaders of the G20, repeated exhortations for a non-violent, mediated solution, and a day-long fast and mass prayer vigil, he provided a moral counterweight to the Obama administration and its proposed air strikes. His powerful criticisms of capitalist excesses have seen the church regain relevance in the contemporary debate on social justice. And his decision to make Lampedusa the location of his first trip outside Rome, slamming a \\"globalisation of indifference\\" that allowed migrants to die in the Mediterranean, he focused the eyes of the world on an often-overlooked problem.\\" The jury's out Curia reform The \\"outsider\\" pope was elected with a mandate to come to Rome and bang heads together. In the fading light of Benedict's papacy, infighting and corruption within the Curia – the Vatican's central bureaucracy – had dominated amid the so-called Vatileaks affair. Francis has announced measures to engender reform, most notably the creation of a secretariat of the economy – a kind of finance ministry – to centralise the handling of business and administrative affairs. That will be led by the outspoken Australian Cardinal George Pell. The other key staffing decision was to replace the widely discredited Tarcisio Bertone as secretary of state –a symbolic and practical move Francis must hope will draw a line under an era of scandal and incompetence. Core teachings The pope appearing in a selfie taken by young pilgrims in St Peter's, Rome. Photograph: AP Liberals who would like to see significant doctrinal shifts from Francis should alter their expectations. The pope has made clear his commitment to core church teachings on issues such as abortion and women's ordination. But that doesn't mean there will be no change at all. For one thing, Francis has said the church needs a \\"new balance\\" and a less condemnatory attitude to sexual morality. For another, he has shown himself to be a pragmatic conservative, committed to doctrine but concerned with how the church responds to pastoral realities. In concrete terms, speculation centres on whether he will see fit to announce a shift on the treatment of remarried divorcees, now banned from receiving holy communion. Walter Kasper, the cardinal Francis chose to speak on the subject at a consistory earlier this year, told La Repubblica newspaper this week that the church should try to find a \\"realistic application of doctrine\\", adding: \\"The church must never judge as though it had a guillotine in its hands.\\" Vatican Bank All too often the cause of embarrassment for the papacy, the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR) is at the heart of Francis's reform – and ethical finance – agenda. He has set up a commission of lay experts and clerics to investigate the bank's running, and has replaced four of five cardinals appointed under Benedict on an oversight body. Under German president Ernst von Freyberg, the bank is trying to improve transparency and has hired an outside firm of accountants to help it meet international standards. But an Italian investigation into allegations of money laundering – which the bank denies – continues and a report by a Council of Europe body, Moneyval, in December said the IOR still had some way to go. Francis has made it clear that, if the bank cannot be adequately reformed, he would have no compunction about closing it for good. Must try harder Clerical sex abuse There are growing suspicions that this, more than any other issue, is emerging as Francis's blind spot. Critics say he has done little to ramp up the church's response to the scandal. Though he has said officials must \\"act decisively\\" on the problem – and in December announced a new commission to examine ways of better protecting children and helping victims – most advocates for abuse victims say another commission is not what is needed and criticise him for not making the deep changes they, and the UN, say are necessary. They have been left despondent by Francis's occasional comments on the issue, in which he has generally defended the church while condemning the abuse. An interview published this month in which he claimed that no other institution had acted with the same \\"transparency and responsibility\\" elicited particular anger. \\"His comments about clerical sex abuse [in the interview] make it clear that he is using the same tired and irrelevant playbook the bishops have worn out over the past few years,\\" wrote priest and victims' supporter Tom Doyle in the National Catholic Reporter. ||||| Pope Francis is celebrating his first year in office. The Argentinean-born pontiff is currently on a week-long spiritual retreat with cardinals and bishops in the Alban Hills near Rome. Italian opinion polls give Pope Francis the highest popularity rating of any recent pontiff. However, the BBC's David Willey in Rome says that Francis's papacy so far has shown a change of style rather than of substance. Pope Francis is the first Latin American - and the first Jesuit - to lead the Roman Catholic Church. Pope Francis eschews the superstar status he has been accorded by the world's media Pope marks one year at Vatican Since taking office, pilgrims have been arriving in Rome in unprecedented numbers. He is also riding high on social media, with 11 million following him in nine languages on Twitter. Our correspondent says Francis's approval rating has remained high despite a recent UN report accusing the Catholic Church of systematically covering up for tens of thousands of child-abusing priests reported to the Vatican. The Pope himself has denounced any cult of personality. He recently told Corriere della Sera: \\"Portraying the pope as a kind of superman, a type of star, it seems offensive.\\" Pope Francis's reforms are not popular with some conservative Catholics Pope Francis travelled by bus to spend the first anniversary of his election in a spiritual retreat In Argentina artefacts to mark the anniversary are widely on display Italian opinion polls give Pope Francis the highest popularity rating of any recent pontiff Francis, 77, has appointed new advisers to help him run the Church and is planning major reforms of Vatican finances and of the scandal-hit Vatican bank. But our correspondent adds that for the moment there is no sign of a change in official Catholic teaching on artificial contraception or on the celibacy rule for priests. However the Pope's compassionate attitude - especially his outreach to believers who have abandoned going to Mass and to divorced Catholics banned from receiving communion - is not universally admired by traditionalist cardinals. Likewise his attitude towards gay people - he says that he is not going to judge them - contrasts strongly with that of his predecessor Pope Benedict, who called homosexuality \\"intrinsically evil\\". Thursday's anniversary is not being marked in any official way, a move that Vatican-watchers say is in keeping with the Pope's tendency to eschew pomp and ceremony. The decision to celebrate the anniversary quietly is a sound alternative to what almost certainly would have been a media frenzy if Pope Francis had decided to mark the anniversary in public, correspondents say. ||||| Religion makes a lot of mistakes. Faith traditions can be so harsh that they drive away everyone but the self-righteous scolds. Or they can so indulge in therapeutic comfort and manufactured joy that they come to seem like a charlatan’s game. E.J. Dionne writes about politics in a twice-weekly column and on the PostPartisan blog. He is also a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution, a government professor at Georgetown University and a frequent commentator on politics for National Public Radio, ABC’s “This Week” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” View Archive They can be so otherworldly that they offer no guidance to those living in this one on matters of justice, freedom and how we should live together. Or they are so captive to the here-and-now that it becomes hard to distinguish between a congregation and a party headquarters. And for many in the wealthy nations and among the young, religion has no relevance to their lives whatsoever. It’s seen by some as a charming throwback and by others as one more insidious force focused on power, money and self-preservation. When Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected pope a year ago, only a few expected that the new Catholic leader would confront all of these challenges simultaneously. 1 of 27 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Pope Francis: Acts of humility View Photos The new prelate, who has been named Time magazine’s Person of the Year, is rewriting the rules in his first year at the Vatican.

Yes, his choice of the name Francis was a promising sign that he would emulate a saint devoted to the poor and to simplicity. Yes, he was already on record with searing criticisms of the injustices of global capitalism. From the beginning, he stressed his more humble role as the “Bishop of Rome,” suggesting an anti-imperial papacy. And then it continued. He disdained the trappings of piety and might, including the ornate regalia that appeal to so many prelates. The Roman joke was that as priests got with his program, one could find many lacy surplices on sale at steep discounts on eBay. On his first Holy Thursday, Francis washed the feet not of the usual group of priests but rather of a dozen young people being held at a juvenile detention center, including two women and two Muslims. He has not altered church doctrine, but his shift in emphasis has been breathtaking. “We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods,” he has said. “This is not possible.” He thus declared that the church’s main mission would no longer be as a lead combatant in the culture wars. It would stand primarily with and for the neediest. The most important aspect of a Pew survey released this month was not its finding that 68 percent of U.S. Catholics thought Francis was changing the church for the better, or that 76 percent said he was doing a good or excellent job of addressing the needs and concerns of the poor. No, the truly revealing fact about this study is that it did not even occur to Pew’s pollsters to ask in their benchmark poll a year ago whether poverty should be a priority of the new pope. This is no knock on Pew; the fact that its researchers had to include a new question about poverty this year shows how much Francis has transformed the church. The pope said recently that he was uncomfortable with being seen as a “superman,” and indeed, he is not. Francis expressed his unease in an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera during which he made the most troubling misstep of the year. Speaking of the pedophilia scandal that has shaken the faith of so many Catholics, particularly in the United States and in Ireland, Francis was uncharacteristically defensive and aggressive, insisting that the Catholic Church “is perhaps the only public institution that has moved with transparency and responsibility.” “No one has done more,” he added, “and yet the church is the only one that has been attacked.” Pope Francis had a noteworthy first year as head of the Catholic church. PostTV reviews a few of the pope's memorable photo ops that seem to parallel with common Bible passages. We used The New American Bible. (Jonathan Elker, Gillian Brockell and Kate M. Tobey/The Washington Post) In fact, the church is not “the only one that has been attacked.” Even if it were, a pope who has emphasized the urgency of seeing the world from the perspective of the vulnerable and the wounded should have been the first to hear how his words might sound to the victims of abuse. A leader who has criticized a “psychology of princes” and the “spirit of careerism” should have known better. But the keen disappointment felt over this is a mark of how high Francis has lifted expectations. He has shown that the spiritual life is also a life of social commitment. He demands a lot while preaching about a God of mercy, confounding scolds and religious therapists alike. By engaging joyfully with nonbelievers and those who believe differently, he speaks to those skeptical that Christianity has anything left to say. He called for a church that is “bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets” and has proved that such a church is hard to ignore. Read more from E.J.

Article: The rise of Islam, based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region. Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, and the process of ijtihad to find truth—in effect all philosophy was \\"political\\" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the \\"rationalist\\" Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more Hellenic view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. By the late ancient period, however, the \\"traditionalist\\" Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed. According to the Asharites, reason must be subordinate to the Quran and the Sunna. Question: What strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of origin of power in the Mediterranean region?","completion":"The rise of Islam, based on both the Qur'an and the teachings and actions of Prophet Muhammad, strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of the origin of power in the Mediterranean region. This transformation occurred as Islam rapidly expanded its influence, challenging existing power structures, and introducing new ideas and philosophies that reshaped the region's cultural, political, and religious landscape. One of the critical aspects of the rise of Islam was the emphasis it placed on the interconnection between science and religion, asserting that these two domains were interlinked and could not be separated. Islamic teaching promoted the process of ijtihad, which referred to the intellectual effort and rigorous interpretation of Islamic law, religious principles, and scriptures in order to discover the truth. As a result, all philosophical inquiries and debates took on a \\"political\\" aspect, as they held significant implications for governance and societal organization. This interconnected approach, however, was challenged by the rationalist Mutazilite philosophers, who took a more Hellenic perspective, where reason and logical thinking took precedence over revelation and religious scripture. They were the first speculative theologians of Islam and were supported by a secular aristocracy that wanted greater autonomy and freedom from the influence of the Caliphate. Eventually, however, the traditionalist Asharite view of Islam gained prominence by the late ancient period. According to the Asharites, reason and rational thought must be subordinate to the authority of the Quran, which is the central religious text of Islam, and the Sunna, which refers to the traditions and practices associated with the life and teachings of Prophet Muhammad. In this view, understanding and interpretation had to be aligned with the fundamental sources of Islamic belief, reinforcing religious authority over a more individualistic and rational approach. Thus, the rise of Islam, encompassing the teachings of the Quran and Prophet Muhammad, strongly altered the power balances and perceptions of the origin of power in the Mediterranean region. The ongoing debates and evolution of Islamic philosophy, along with its focus on the relationship between science, religion, and governance, were instrumental in reshaping the cultural, political, and religious landscape of the region in that period."},{"prompt":"Fact 1: If a neutral atom loses an electron then an atom with a negative charge will be formed.

(ii). pond was safer..","completion":"Hamza's pet turtle liked to be in the water dish instead of the pond, because the dish was safer. The compact size and shallower depth of the water dish provided the turtle with a sense of security, as it could easily retreat into its shell should it sense any danger or disturbance in its environment. Additionally, the physical barrier of the dish's walls prevented potential predators from accessing and threatening the turtle, unlike in the pond whose larger size attracted a wider range of animals, both aquatic and land-dwelling, which posed a greater risk to the turtle's safety. Furthermore, the water dish offered a more stable and predictable environment for Hamza's pet turtle. The water temperature and quality within the dish were easier to maintain, ensuring that the turtle had optimal living conditions. This was particularly important since turtles, being ectothermic animals, heavily rely on their environment to regulate their body temperature. In the pond, water quality and temperature could fluctuate due to various external factors such as weather, pollution, and the presence of other organisms, which could negatively impact the turtle's health and well-being. Another reason the dish was safer for the turtle was the reduced risk of injury from navigating the pond's environment. The pond might have had submerged obstacles, such as rocks or vegetation, that the turtle could get caught in or injured by while swimming. The simple layout of the dish eliminated potential hazards and allowed the turtle to swim and bask with ease. Moreover, the limited space within the water dish made it easier for Hamza to monitor his pet turtle's behavior and overall health. Given that the pond would have offered numerous hiding places and a vast space for the turtle to roam, it might have been difficult to spot any signs of illness or injury early on. In the water dish, any changes in the turtle's behavior, appearance, or appetite could be monitored and addressed more promptly, ensuring that the turtle received proper care and maintained good health. Lastly, the water dish provided Hamza's pet turtle with an environment that closely resembled its natural habitat, giving it a comfortable and soothing space to live in. Many turtle species favor smaller, shallow water bodies where they can easily climb out to bask and hide if necessary. The water dish catered to these preferences much better than the pond, which might have been deeper and more difficult for the turtle to navigate. In conclusion, the water dish was a safer choice for Hamza's pet turtle due to the increased sense of security, easier environmental control, reduced risk of injury, improved monitoring, and resemblance to the turtle's natural habitat. While the pond might have provided more swimming space and visual appeal, the dish ultimately better catered to the turtle's needs, ensuring its safety and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Last updated at 9:55 AM on 4th November 2011. Britain's beleaguered Post Offices came under attack yesterday in a move which will leave millions of savers stranded. In a shock announcement, National Savings & Investments revealed plans to end its 150-year relationship with the network. It marks a watershed moment for the two organisations, which used to be one company called the Post Office Savings Bank, founded in 1861. They were separated in 1969. Goodbye letter: National Savings & Investments are to end their 150-year relationship with the Post Office. The country’s 11,800 Post Offices. are a vital lifeline for savers, particularly the elderly, who go into. their local branch to withdraw money from their NS&I savings. NS&I. products, such as its Investment Account which has 2.4million users,. are hugely popular because it is the only savings giant which offers a. 100 per cent guarantee on all money. But. yesterday NS&I said it has decided to gradually cut its ties with. the Post Office, in a move described by postal experts as ‘bitterly. disappointing’. They fear it is another nail in the coffin for the Post Offices which, in many villages, represent the only remaining shop. Over. the next two years, NS&I will force all its customers to start. using the internet, the telephone or the post to contact them. They will. not be able to use the Post Office for common transactions such as. depositing or withdrawing money. There. is only one exception. Premium Bonds will still be bought and sold at. Post Office counters for at least the next four years. The. contract will be reviewed in 2015, although an NS&I spokesman said. yesterday that a review is ‘perfectly normal’ and should not raise. alarm. She added: ‘We intend for Premium Bonds to remain on sale over the Post Office counter.’ The Post Office has been. haemorrhaging lucrative Government contracts, such as renewing the BBC. TV licence. Most recently, it emerged it will lose the £20million a year. so-called ‘Green Giros’ contract – the payment of benefit cheques to. vulnerable people with no bank account. George Thomson, general secretary of the. National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, said: ‘We are surprised and. bitterly disappointed by NS&I’s decision. This news reinforces the. urgent need for ministers to deliver on their pledge to make the Post. Office the “front office” for government.’ Ministers have repeatedly pledged that. there will be ‘no programme of closures’ like under the previous. Government. When Labour came to power in 1997, there were just over. 19,000 outlets in the UK. As a result of Labour’s closure programme,. there are now 11,800. The first two NS&I accounts to be. hit – the Investment Account and the Easy Access Savings Account – have. a total of more than 2.5million customers who have a total of. £6.2billion with NS&I. But. last night it said the Children’s Bonus Bonds, which has 1.2million. customers, will also disappear from Post Offices at some point. An. NS&I spokesman said: ‘We have not finalised our plans but we expect. them to be only available from NS&I.’ The. decision was fuelled by the Post Office’s decision to set up its own. savings arm, in a joint venture with the Bank of Ireland in 2004.

Question: Who has been demoted? Movie title: Buck Privates Come Home Movie plot: After serving in Europe during World War II, Herbie Brown (Lou Costello) and Slicker Smith (Bud Abbott) return to the United States aboard a troop ship. Also on board is their old nemesis, Sgt. Collins (Nat Pendleton). As the ship nears New York, Collins and his superiors search the men's belongings for contraband. A six-year-old French orphan, Evey (Beverly Simmons), whom Herbie and Slicker befriended, is found in Herbie's duffle bag. She is handed over to Lt. Sylvia Hunter (Joan Fulton), who delivers her to immigration officials in New York. However, during a shift change at the office, Evey is mistaken for a neighborhood kid and set free. Meanwhile, Herbie and Slicker are back to their pre-war occupation of peddling ties in Times Square. Collins is also back at his old job--a police officer assigned to the same beat. He is about to arrest the boys when Evey shows up and helps them escape. Herbie and Slicker attempt to adopt Evey, but are told that one of them must be married and have a steady income. Evey suggests that Herbie marry Sylvia. They show up at her apartment, but learn that Sylvia already has a boyfriend, Bill Gregory (Tom Brown). At one point Herbie and Slicker purchase what seems to be an ideal home for 750, but the seller doesn't want to let them see the interior prior to purchase. Before Herbie can get the front door open, the seller gives a signal and a truck hauls off the faÃ§ade, revealing that the boys had just purchased a broken-down old bus.

He is sure he will win the 20,000 prize at the Gold Cup Stakes, but his car is being held at a local garage until past-due bills are paid.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Early in March 1676, a Danish fleet of 20 ships under Admiral Niels Juel left Copenhagen. On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. They tried to get ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The... answer the following question: What two fleets were involved in the Battle of Bornholm? Answer:","completion":"The two fleets involved in the Battle of Bornholm were the Danish-Dutch allied fleet under Admiral Niels Juel and Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, and the Swedish fleet under Admiral Creutz."},{"prompt":"Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that did not meet commercial expectations and broke up in 1978? Marquee Moon was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on the country's albums chart. The record's two singles—the title track and \\"Prove It\\"—both charted on the UK Top 30. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by Nick Kent's rave two-page review of the album for NME.While holidaying in London after Marquee Moon's completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on NME's front cover and notified Elektra's press department, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on Peter Gabriel's American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's middle-American progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving.In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with Blondie as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist Chris Stein said that Television were \\"so competitive\\" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where \\"all our equipment was shoved up at the [Glasgow] Apollo and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space.\\"By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting Marquee Moon, which they dismissed as a commercial failure.

In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.

Question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what currency in dominican republic should i bring? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, I need to provide you with the correct currency used in the Dominican Republic and suggest which currency you should bring for your convenience during your travels. Step 1: Identify the official currency of the Dominican Republic The official currency of the Dominican Republic is the Dominican Peso (DOP). Step 2: Provide information on major currencies accepted in the Dominican Republic Apart from the Dominican Peso, the US Dollar (USD) is widely accepted in tourist areas and major businesses. Other currencies, such as Euros (EUR), might be accepted at some places but could have limited use. Step 3: Consider factors like exchange rates, fees, and accessibility Bringing local currency (DOP) is usually more convenient and economical, as there won't be any conversion fees, and its use is unrestricted. Also, when using foreign currencies, you may not receive the best exchange rates or may have issues when making small purchases with larger denomination bills. Step 4: Evaluate options for obtaining currency You can exchange money at banks, hotels, and official exchange bureaus (casas de cambio) in the Dominican Republic. ATMs are also widespread and a practical way to obtain Dominican Pesos. However, be aware of fees associated with currency exchange and using foreign cards at ATMs. Step 5: Provide the final answer You should primarily bring Dominican Pesos (DOP) when traveling to the Dominican Republic, as it is the official currency and accepted everywhere.

However, I have to acknowledge that no diet is perfect for every single person and Mediterranean diet is no exception to that rule. The Mediterranean Diet is not for everyone. There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive. When you eat primarily fish, fresh (preferably organic) fruits and vegetables, nuts, etc. you will find that they are more expensive than grabbing a cheeseburger from a fast food joint or buying junk food from the vending machine at work. But . . . if you consider the health problems you may endure in the future and the cost of health care that goes with those problems, you may want to think twice about the actual cost. The healthy foods on the Mediterranean diet may not seem so expensive after all.

Write a summary based on this article: If you’ve ever walked barefoot on asphalt on a hot summer day, you know that it gets pretty darn hot. It also does a really great job of sharing all that stored heat with its surroundings. That can make a huge difference in the temperature in areas where there’s a lot of blacktop around. In the heavily-paved neighborhoods of Los Angeles, for example, the heat island effect is a very real concern. L.A. Street Services is working on a fix. The workers in that picture aren’t cleaning up a spill, they’re spreading a white (actually very, very light gray) topcoat on several L.A. roadways. Hitting control-I on the color palette makes a big difference — as much as 10 degrees on a summer afternoon, according to Street Services. Streets in all 15 of L.A.’s electoral districts have been coated as part of the pilot project. If the results are anywhere near as positive as they’ve been elsewhere in California, crews will no doubt be whitewashing a whole lot more. A similar test in Canoga Park, a city of 60,000 about 30 miles from Los Angeles, saw the temperature on one stretch of road reduced from 93 to 70 degrees. In Encino, a parking lot that was coated dropped from a blistering 160 degrees down to a much more bearable 130. This isn’t the first push L.A. has made to combat the heat island effect. Three years ago residents were offered rebates for doing the very same thing to their roofs, with some experts saying that the change from black to white could reduce average temperatures in California by as much as two degrees. That might not seem like much, but every notch on the thermometer helps these days. Los Angeles broke 90 degrees four times in July, and the monthly average has climbed more than 3.5 degrees over the past 5 years.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Bin Laden and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America. The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2, Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance. Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994, Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets. Question: \\"To fund a jihad, how much of Bin Laden's personal inheritance could have gone to the terrorists?\\" Answer: \\"30 million per year until 1994\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"I'm going to explain this in a very simple way so that a five-year-old can understand. Bin Laden was a man who wanted to plan an attack on America with his group called Al Qaeda. They needed money to do this. People used to think Bin Laden had a lot of money from his family (around 300 million) to spend on the attack. But, the truth is, Bin Laden did not have that much money. He got about 1 million a year from his family, until 1994 when the government took his money away. So, he couldn't use his own money for the attacks. Instead, Bin Laden and Al Qaeda got money from other people who wanted to help. They raised about 30 million every year to plan the attack. So, the answer is \\"Bin Laden couldn't use his personal inheritance to fund the attack. Al Qaeda got money from donations, raising about 30 million per year.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - joy - addiction - relaxation - fatigue - headaches A:","completion":"Mandy was watching television because she had a long day and she could not do much else due to her current state. Given the context, the most suitable option to answer the above question is fatigue. Fatigue is a feeling of extreme tiredness, weariness, or exhaustion, often resulting from physical or mental exertion. In Mandy's case, her long day likely involved various activities that drained her energy, leaving her feeling fatigued. As she was fatigued, Mandy found it difficult to engage in other activities or tasks that might require more effort or concentration. Watching television is a passive activity that does not demand much energy or attention, making it a suitable choice for someone experiencing fatigue, like Mandy. The other options provided do not align with the given context as well as fatigue does: 1. Joy: While Mandy may have experienced moments of joy during her day, it does not explain why she could not do much else but watch television. 2. Addiction: Addiction refers to a compulsive, uncontrollable dependence on a substance or behavior. Mandy's decision to watch television was due to her fatigue, not an addiction. 3. Relaxation: Though watching television can be a relaxing activity, the context of the question implies that Mandy was unable to do much else because of a specific condition rather than just a desire for relaxation. 4. Headaches: Although headaches can limit a person's ability to perform certain tasks, there is no mention of Mandy experiencing any pain or discomfort in the given scenario. In summary, Mandy was watching television because she had a long day and could not do much else due to her experiencing fatigue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie plot title: The Darwin Awards Movie plot: The film opens with a car with a JATO rocket strapped to it. The movie then shifts to Michael Burrows, a criminal profiler for the San Francisco Police Department. Shot in documentary style, the film is ostensibly a dissertation by a film school grad that follows Michael throughout the story. Fired from the police force after his hematophobia allows a serial killer to get away, Michael wallows in a deep depression for several weeks before coming up with a way to combine his Darwin Awards obsession with his talent for profiling. He will help insurance companies detect people more likely to accidentally end their own lives, so they are not sold insurance policies. After impressing an insurance company manager with his profiling talent, Michael is paired up with Siri, a specialist in strange insurance cases. Siri and Michael travel the country on behalf of the company, investigating several legendary examples of stupidity, such as the JATO rocket car. A pair of men attempting to ice fish become frustrated and use a stick of dynamite to blast a hole in the ice. The problem is their dog plays fetch with the lit dynamite and runs it back to their brand-new SUV. As they investigate the cases, Michael tries to pinpoint a common factor for these people. The only explanation is a confused monologue by Siri about insurance companies always denying claims and driving people insane. Michael narrowly avoids becoming a Darwin Award winner throughout the movie. He and Siri are stranded in the middle of nowhere on a cold night. Desperate for warmth, he attempts to start a fire with gasoline, causing his car to explode. Siri later confronts Michael, accusing him of being obsessed with the Darwin Awards.

Title: Porky's Movie plot: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see.

Write a text based on this summary: ohchr deploys regional adviser for central asia Text:","completion":"The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has taken a significant step in addressing human rights concerns in Central Asia. Recently, the OHCHR has deployed a regional adviser to Central Asia, a first in the organization's history. This move not only signifies the UN's commitment to safeguarding human rights but also serves as an opportunity to foster better relations among Central Asian nations. Central Asia consists of the five former Soviet republics - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan - which have been grappling with various human rights issues since gaining independence in the early 1990s. The five countries share several cultural, historical, and economic ties, as well as a common legacy of human rights challenges. By deploying a regional adviser, the OHCHR aims to foster more effective cooperation between national actors and the international community, promote adherence to international human rights standards, and increase support for practical implementation of required reforms. Several areas of concern have been identified in the region, such as freedom of expression, association, and assembly. Central Asian countries have faced scrutiny for limiting these rights, which has caused a chilling effect on civil society and stifled the work of human rights defenders. Additionally, issues like rule of law, good governance, and sustainable development are central to Central Asia's human rights framework. The regional adviser's role will be to work closely with governments, civil society organizations, international partners, and other stakeholders to advance human rights in each country, as well as address concerns on a regional level. This would include offering technical assistance, facilitating dialogue between national and international actors, and working to build capacity for human rights organizations in the region. By establishing a strong foundation of human rights protection in Central Asia, the UN hopes to create a more stable and just society in the region. As a regional adviser for Central Asia, their mission will be to embark on a comprehensive and proactive approach to addressing human rights issues and promote long-lasting, positive change. It is anticipated that this unprecedented move will generate synergies between countries and contribute to fostering a culture of human rights in Central Asia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whiskers loved to roll around in the grass and play with her favorite toy mouse all day long. One day, Whiskers discovered a big, muddy puddle in the middle of the garden. It had rained a lot the previous day, and the dirt had turned into wet, gooey mud. Whiskers was very curious about this strange new thing, so she decided to get closer. As she approached the puddle, she saw her reflection in the water. It looked like another cat! Whiskers thought that maybe she had found a new friend and excitedly tapped the water with her paw. Splash! The water splashed all over Whiskers, and now she was all wet and muddy. \\"Oh dear, I don't like this at all,\\" thought Whiskers as she tried to shake off the mud. But the more she shook, the more stuck the mud became in her fluffy fur. Whiskers didn't know what to do, and she started to meow loudly for help. Thankfully, her best friend Tommy, a small boy who lived in the house nearby, heard her cries and came running to her rescue. Tommy saw Whiskers covered in mud and knew he had to help her get clean again. He gently picked her up and carried her to his house where he prepared a warm, bubbly bath. Whiskers, as a cat, usually didn't like water. But this time, she knew she needed the bath to be clean and fluffy again. With a bit of hesitation, Whiskers jumped into the bathtub, and Tommy carefully started washing her with soap and a soft towel. Tommy was very gentle and made sure not to get any water in Whiskers' eyes or ears. He rinsed off all the soap and mud from Whiskers' fur, and she could feel herself getting cleaner and cleaner. As the last of the muddy water swirled down the drain, Whiskers began to purr to show her appreciation. Once Whiskers was completely clean, Tommy dried her off with a soft, fluffy towel. Whiskers felt so much better and was so grateful to Tommy for rescuing her from the mud.

Kevin, on the other hand, recently moved to Toronto which just finished a several month long tree planting initiative that has drastically lowered the amount of air pollutants in the city. Who is less at risk for having a heart attack? Hint: Air pollution can also indirectly cause other health issues and even deaths. Air pollutants can cause an increase in cancer including lung cancer, eye problems, and other conditions. For example, using certain chemicals on farms, such as the insecticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and toxic PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyl), can cause cancer. Indoors, pollutants such as radon or asbestos can also increase your cancer risk. Lastly, air pollution can lead to heart disease, including heart attack and stroke. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information and taking into account the effects of air pollution on human health, Kevin, who recently moved to Toronto, is less at risk for having a heart attack compared to Michael who moved to Xinjiang. Xinjiang, as mentioned, has a large amount of air pollutants due to the chemical manufacturing industry. These pollutants can cause a variety of health issues, including increased risk of cancer (lung cancer, in particular), eye problems, and other conditions. Additionally, the use of certain chemicals, like DDT and toxic PCBs, can lead to even more severe health complications. Exposure to air pollution is also linked to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3) are some of the key air pollutants that adversely affect heart health. These pollutants can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, blood vessel constriction, and reduced oxygen-carrying capacity, all of which contribute to heart attack risk. On the other hand, Toronto has recently undertaken a tree-planting initiative that has significantly reduced air pollution levels in the city. Trees are well-known air purifiers: they absorb pollutants like NO2, SO2, and PM2.5, and release oxygen in return. This improvement in air quality greatly lowers the risk of heart attacks among residents like Kevin. Moreover, trees provide numerous other health benefits, apart from their air-purifying abilities. They help cool down urban areas, reducing heat-related health problems, and provide spaces for physical activity, relaxation, and social interaction, all of which contribute to better overall physical and mental well-being. In conclusion, Kevin, living in Toronto, is less at risk for having a heart attack due to the city's improved air quality following the tree-planting initiative. On the contrary, Michael faces higher health risks, as he resides in Xinjiang, which is burdened with considerable air pollution from the chemical manufacturing industry. These air pollutants can lead to both respiratory and cardiovascular problems, making him more susceptible to heart attacks and other health complications. Therefore, it is crucial for regions like Xinjiang to implement pollution control measures to protect the health of their citizens and environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Chinese Influences: The Japanese were forced out of the Korean peninsula in the sixth century, but not before the Koreans had bequeathed to the Yamato court copies of the sacred images and scriptures of Chinese Buddhism. Just as Christianity introduced Mediterranean culture into northern Europe, so Buddhism brought Chinese culture into Japanese society. Throughout the seventh and eighth centuries numerous Japanese monks, scholars, and artists made the perilous trip west across the Sea of Japan to study Chinese religion, history, music, literature, and painting — later to be brought back for further development in Japan. An outstanding figure of this time was Prince Shotoku, who in 604 developed the \\"Seventeen-Article Constitution,\\" outlining a code of human conduct and the ideals of state as a basic law for the nation. He also established relations with the Sui dynasty in China. Through him, the Japanese imperial court developed Chinese patterns of centralized government, with its formal bureaucracy of eight court ranks. The Chinese calendar was used to calculate the year of Japan's foundation by counting back the 1,260 years of the Chinese cosmological cycle. Thus, 660 b.c. is still the official date celebrated nationwide. At this early stage in its history Japan was already (for the most part) only nominally ruled by the emperor. De facto power was exercised by the militarily and economically strongest family. The Sogas had promoted Buddhism as an imperially sanctioned counterweight to the native Shinto religion, along with the new Chinese customs, to weaken the influence of their more conservative rivals. But they in turn were ousted in a.d. 645 by Nakatomi Kamatari, founder of the great Fujiwara clan, which was to rule Japanese affairs for hundreds of years and provide prominent advisers to the emperor even up to the 19th century.

What term is used in Belgium and the Netherlands to refer to an institution like a German Fachhochschule?","completion":"In Belgium and the Netherlands, the term \\"Hogeschool\\" is used to refer to an institution that is similar to a German Fachhochschule. Hogescholen are higher education institutions that offer professional bachelor and master's degree programs, typically focusing on applied sciences, arts, education, and business studies. These institutions emphasize practical, vocational training, and applied research, preparing students for careers in various industries and sectors. Like their German counterpart Fachhochschulen, Hogescholen aim to bridge the gap between traditional academic universities and the practical demands of the professional world. The programs offered at Hogescholen are designed to equip students with the knowledge, skills, and experiences needed to excel in their chosen field. Students at Hogescholen engage in hands-on projects, internships, and real-world case studies, allowing them to apply their theoretical knowledge in practical contexts. It is important to note that there might be some differences between the institutions in Belgium and the Netherlands. In Belgium, Hogescholen are mainly found in the Flemish Community, where they are called \\"Hogeschool\\" or \\"Haute École\\" in French. They offer professional bachelor's degrees, academic bachelor's degrees, and master's degrees. Dutch Hogescholen, on the other hand, primarily offer professional bachelor's degrees and master's degrees in applied sciences. In Finland, the comparable institution is the \\"ammattikorkeakoulu,\\" also known as a university of applied sciences.

In addition to the dollar the coinage act officially established monetary units of mill or one-thousandth of a dollar (symbol ₥), cent or one-hundredth of a dollar (symbol ¢), dime or one-tenth of a dollar, and eagle or ten dollars, with prescribed weights and composition of gold, silver, or copper for each. It was proposed in the mid-1800s that one hundred dollars be known as a union, but no union coins were ever struck and only patterns for the 50 half union exist. However, only cents are in everyday use as divisions of the dollar; \\"dime\\" is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of 10¢, while \\"eagle\\" and \\"mill\\" are largely unknown to the general public, though mills are sometimes used in matters of tax levies, and gasoline prices are usually in the form of X.XX9 per gallon, e.g., 3.599, sometimes written as 3.599⁄10. When currently issued in circulating form, denominations equal to or less than a dollar are emitted as U.S. coins while denominations equal to or greater than a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve notes (with the exception of gold, silver and platinum coins valued up to 100 as legal tender, but worth far more as bullion). Both one-dollar coins and notes are produced today, although the note form is significantly more common. In the past, \\"paper money\\" was occasionally issued in denominations less than a dollar (fractional currency) and gold coins were issued for circulation up to the value of 20 (known as the \\"double eagle\\", discontinued in the 1930s). The term eagle was used in the Coinage Act of 1792 for the denomination of ten dollars, and subsequently was used in naming gold coins. Paper currency less than one dollar in denomination, known as \\"fractional currency\\", was also sometimes pejoratively referred to as \\"shinplasters\\". In 1854, James Guthrie, then Secretary of the Treasury, proposed creating 100, 50 and 25 gold coins, which were referred to as a \\"Union\\", \\"Half Union\\", and \\"Quarter Union\\", thus implying a denomination of 1 Union = 100.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Air goes into the lungs - The lungs remove oxygen from the air - Oxygen diffuses from alveoli in the lungs to the bloodstream - Hemoglobin in red blood cells attaches to the oxygen - Red blood cells carry oxygen all around the body - Oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries. Question: suppose the lungs remove more oxygen happens, how will it affect more oxygen diffuses into cells from capillaries. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If the lungs remove more oxygen from the air, it implies that there is more oxygen available to diffuse from the alveoli in the lungs into the bloodstream. This is because the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the blood in the lungs is primarily dependent on the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli. When more oxygen is present in the alveoli, more will diffuse into the bloodstream due to the increased concentration gradient. This would then allow more oxygen to bind to the hemoglobin in red blood cells, assuming that there is not already a saturation of oxygen binding sites. Most of the oxygen in the blood is carried by hemoglobin, and each molecule of hemoglobin can carry up to four oxygen molecules. Consequently, if more oxygen is entering the bloodstream, and there is capacity available in the hemoglobin, more oxygen will be carried all around the body. This would subsequently result in more oxygen diffusing into cells from capillaries (assuming capacity is available within the cells). Oxygen diffuses from the capillaries into body cells down a concentration gradient, meaning it moves from areas of high oxygen concentration to areas of low oxygen concentration. If there is more oxygen being carried in the capillaries, then there will be a greater concentration of oxygen, leading to an increased rate of diffusion into the cells. Therefore, if the lungs were to remove more oxygen from the air, leading to an increased concentration in the bloodstream and more being delivered to body cells, this process would indeed result in more oxygen diffusing into cells from the capillaries. However, this process is dependent on several factors including the availability of binding sites on hemoglobin and the ability of cells to utilize the increased amount of oxygen. Although the overall impact might be more oxygen diffusing into cells from capillaries, it’s important to note that the human body has a sophisticated regulatory system that ensures oxygen levels are balanced. If too much is present, mechanisms kick into gear to return these levels to normal. So in a healthy state, the process is tightly regulated and the initial increase of oxygen intake would eventually be balanced out by these systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Omega-6 is another polyunsaturated fatty acid, found in vegetable oils like corn, cottonseed, soybean, safflower, and sunflower. Studies indicate that reducing consumption of omega-6 while increasing omega-3 produces health benefits, however. A 1:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 would be excellent, but even a 2-4:1 ratio is better than the average American's diet. To improve your ratio, eat more fish and less fried fast foods, potato chips, cookies, donuts, etc. Choosing the right kind of fish is the first step. Preparing it in a way that preserves omega-3 amounts without introducing excessive unhealthy fats or sodium (while also tasting delicious) is an important next step for regular fish consumption. Bake or grill your fish instead of frying, which adds undesirable omega-6 to your omega-3. To reduce amounts of mercury and other toxins, remove the skin and outer fat of your fish, where such toxins tend to reside in higher concentrations. If you intend to drain your canned tuna, choose tuna packed in water. Omega-3 adheres to oils far better than water, so less of it will go down the drain when you empty the can. Maybe you've never been much of a fish person, or maybe you can't get your kids to eat any fish that isn't in the form of a frozen, fried stick. Get creative and you can slip more omega-3-rich fish into your dinner menu. Try replacing meat in dishes with fish. Grilled kebabs, for instance, can easily be switched from beef or chicken to salmon or tuna. Many people recoil at the thought of anchovies, but they are very high in omega-3 and blend easily into many dishes. Finely chopped anchovies practically melt into sauces, for instance, and impart a savory and umami -- not fishy -- flavor. Try adding them to your pasta sauce next time. Algae isn't fish, but it is where much of the omega-3 in fish comes from. Edible algae like seaweed or kelp are high in DHA, one of the component parts of omega-3. Cut out the middleman every once in a while, or better yet, pair a high omega-3 fish with its favorite food on your plate. Fish-based omega-3 contains DHA and EPA, both of which have demonstrated health benefits. The benefits of non-fish based omega-3 foods, which contain ALA, are less definitive but strongly indicative. 2.2-4.4 g of ALA is recommended for a 2,000 kcal/day diet. Good sources of ALA-based omega-3 include soybeans, canola, walnuts, flaxseeds, and ALA-enriched foods like eggs and occasionally peanut butter (among other foods). If you have difficulty consuming enough omega-3 rich foods, have medical conditions that would benefit from higher omega-3 consumption, are pregnant, or are just interested in increasing your omega-3, talk to your healthcare professional about supplements. Omega-3 supplements most often come in the form of fish oil caplets. Some people complain that these have an unpleasant, fishy aftertaste, but there are a wide variety of fish oil options (with a wide variation in quality control), so do some research and find one that works for you. Most people have to worry about too little omega-3, but overconsumption of omega-3 can be a problem for some, as it can cause bleeding problems. Do not consume an average of more than 3 grams per day without consulting your physician. Summary:","completion":"Omega-6 is a polyunsaturated fatty acid found in many vegetable oils, and while it is important for health, maintaining a balanced ratio with omega-3 is crucial. Healthier ratios can be achieved by consuming more omega-3-rich foods such as fish, specifically prepared in ways that do not introduce excessive unhealthy fats or sodium. Suggestions include grilling or baking fish instead of frying and using anchovies or other high omega-3 fish in different recipes. Non-fish based sources of omega-3 include edible algae, soybeans, canola, walnuts, flaxseeds, and certain ALA-enriched foods, while omega-3 supplements offer another alternative for those unable to consume enough omaga-3 rich food. Despite the benefits, caution is advised, as overconsumption of omega-3 can lead to bleeding problems. Consultation with a healthcare professional is recommended for individuals seeking to increase their omega-3 intake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom.

Step 1: Combine like terms -32979*g and 33016*g are like terms because they both have the variable g. We can add them together: -32979*g + 33016*g = (33016 - 32979) * g = 37 * g Now the equation becomes: 37*g - 111 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable g To find the value of g, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 111 to both sides of the equation: 37*g - 111 + 111 = 0 + 111 37*g = 111 Step 3: Solve for g Now that we have isolated the variable g, we can divide both sides of the equation by 37 to find the value of g: 37*g / 37 = 111 / 37 g = 3 So, the solution for the equation -32979*g + 33016*g - 111 = 0 is g = 3."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays. Paragraph: Bill and Paul were farmers.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: You have a job, and it's a good one at that. But something is missing. You aren't really challenged anymore. You've been doing the same thing too long. Your company isn't likely to be promoting anyone soon because it has just gone through a major downsizing, merger or takeover. You have two choices: Quit and start over somewhere else, assuming there is somewhere else to go; or look closer to home, right in your current company, to see what other ways your talents can be put to use. Getting out of your career rut requires a mental tow truck. Rev up your brain and consider these points:. 1. Adjust your pace. If you told a 500-meter sprinter who was 250 meters into the race that he was now going to be running a mile, what's the first thing he'd do? Of course, he would change his tempo. He'd stride differently, pace himself differently. The first thing any sensible employee does in a downsized company is to do the same. Realize the path between promotions may now be longer. The rules have changed in mid-race. Tear out your hair and curse the gods if you think it'll help, but the worst thing you can do is make believe it didn't happen. 2. Analyze your competition. More than ever, it's important to know whom you're up against for those few remaining slots. What are the other people doing? What are they overlooking? Is the next promotion slated to go to somebody outside the company to bring in \\"fresh blood\\" and \\"new perspectives\\"? Analyze yourself, too. How marketable are you in the outside world? Get to know your value and your options. 3. Look for sideways growth. If you can't grow going up, can you build your credentials and experience through lateral moves that would teach you new skills? If you're dead-ended in programming, explore the prospects in marketing. There's never been a company yet that didn't need more sales. Give yourself an alternative route. It's a great way to improve your promotion odds long term. 4. Study the corporate culture. Does the company favor a certain way of doing things? Is there a corporate style? When you study the way the winners do it and compare that to the way you do it, you may not like what you see, but you'd better see it. 5. Take a look at your personal risk factor. Sure, there are ways to move up faster, but before you leap, look at the risks involved. If your advancement opportunities are fewer, you may have to find ways to stand out from the rest of the pack. You may fall flat on your face trying, but are you willing to take the chance? Do you have any bold new ideas to propose? Will you take on projects that really stretch your abilities? You can get yourself noticed, and you may get ahead in the process, but your risk of failure increases, too. I'm for trying. Go the extra mile. It's never crowded. You'll fail some of the time. If you don't, you're not trying hard enough. If you want to be the leader of the pack, you have to be willing to stick your neck out in front of the others. Sometimes it's risky not to take risks. 6. Draw up your plan. Add up all the factors: pace, competition, long-term growth options, risk and the hard facts about advancement. Then put down your plan, in writing. 7. Measure your results. If you can, share your plan with your boss, and then measure your own progress on a fixed schedule. If you still don't seem to be going places, it's time to tune up the résumé and look around for a new track to run on. It's been said that the hardest part of climbing to the top of the ladder is getting through the crowd at the bottom. I would add that the first step is the hardest one to take.

This week could turn out to be pivotal for the Trump White House as both major parties get ready for midterm congressional elections in November. President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies. He cited a recent upsurge in attempted border crossings. What does the investigative journalist group ProPublica think about separating children from their parents? - It disagrees with the policy - It is not interested in the policy - not enough information - It agrees with the policy Answer:","completion":"It disagrees with the policy"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Background: A burlesque is a literary, dramatic or musical work intended to cause laughter by caricaturing the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects. The word derives from the Italian burlesco, which, in turn, is derived from the Italian burla - a joke, ridicule or mockery. Burlesque overlaps in meaning with caricature, parody and travesty, and, in its theatrical sense, with extravaganza, as presented during the Victorian era. \\"Burlesque\\" has been used in English in this literary and theatrical sense since the late 17th century. Context: The word first appears in a title in Francesco Berni's Opere burlesche of the early 16th century, works that had circulated widely in manuscript before they were printed. For a time, burlesque verses were known as poesie bernesca in his honour. 'Burlesque' as a literary term became widespread in 17th century Italy and France, and subsequently England, where it referred to a grotesque imitation of the dignified or pathetic. Shakespeare's Pyramus and Thisbe scene in Midsummer Night's Dream and the general mocking of romance in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Knight of the Burning Pestle were early examples of such imitation. In 17th century Spain, playwright and poet Miguel de Cervantes ridiculed medieval romance in his many satirical works. Among Cervantes' works are Exemplary Novels and the Eight Comedies and Eight New Interludes published in 1615. The term burlesque has been applied retrospectively to works of Chaucer and Shakespeare and to the Graeco-Roman classics. Burlesque was intentionally ridiculous in that it imitated several styles and combined imitations of certain authors and artists with absurd descriptions. In this, the term was often used interchangeably with \\"pastiche\\", \\"parody\\", and the 17th and 18th century genre of the \\"mock-heroic\\". Burlesque depended on the reader's (or listener's) knowledge of the subject to make its intended effect, and a high degree of literacy was taken for granted. 17th and 18th century burlesque was divided into two types: High burlesque refers to a burlesque imitation where a literary, elevated manner was applied to a commonplace or comically inappropriate subject matter as, for example, in the literary parody and the mock-heroic. One of the most commonly cited examples of high burlesque is Alexander Pope's \\"sly, knowing and courtly\\" The Rape of the Lock. Low burlesque applied an irreverent, mocking style to a serious subject; an example is Samuel Butler's poem Hudibras, which described the misadventures of a Puritan knight in satiric doggerel verse, using a colloquial idiom. Butler's addition to his comic poem of an ethical subtext made his caricatures into satire. In more recent times, burlesque true to its literary origins is still performed in revues and sketches. Tom Stoppard's 1974 play Travesties is an example of a full-length play drawing on the burlesque tradition. Question: what other works were made as burlesque? Answer:","completion":"Other works made as burlesque include: 1. \\"Don Quixote\\" by Miguel de Cervantes – A satirical novel that ridicules the chivalric romances popular in its time and pokes fun at the various social and moral norms of Spanish society. 2. \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" by Jonathan Swift – This work is often considered a burlesque due to its use of humor, satire, and exaggeration to critique the political and social climate of 18th-century England. 3. \\"The Beggar's Opera\\" by John Gay – A satirical ballad opera that mocks the conventions of traditional Italian opera and the society of its time. 4. \\"The Loves of the Triangles\\" by George Canning, George Ellis, and John Hookham Frere – A parody of Erasmus Darwin's poem \\"The Loves of the Plants,\\" mocking the idea of imbuing plants with human-like romantic characteristics and satirizing the scientific language and theories of the day. 5. \\"The Dunciad\\" by Alexander Pope – A mock-heroic poem that satirizes the literary culture of 18th-century England by depicting a world dominated by Dullness and her agents, who represent the mediocre writers and critics Pope disdained. 6. \\"Candide\\" by Voltaire – A philosophical satire that employs humor, exaggeration, and irony to critique various social, religious, and philosophical issues. 7. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" by Jane Austen – Though primarily a coming-of-age novel, it can also be considered a burlesque as it satirizes and parodies the Gothic novels popular during Austen's time. 8. \\"The Threepenny Opera\\" by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill – A satirical musical play that challenges the traditional notions of opera and critiques capitalism and corruption. 9. \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\" by T.S. Eliot – A modernist dramatization that employs burlesque elements, such as absurdity and dark humor, to confront the disillusionment of post-World War I society.

This article: Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic \\"sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass\\", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; \\"He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose\\". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: \\"the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far\\". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance \\"a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible\\". contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of Holst's pupil?, what is it ?

In this case, the length of A is 12 and i is 4: 4 < 12 -> True Since the condition is True, we can proceed with the task. Step 3: List all elements of A after the first i elements To achieve this, we'll need to create a new list called 'result' which will store the elements of A after the first i elements.

Repeated pesticide use on an insect population can result in some of the insects becoming resistant to that pesticide over time. Which process is responsible for the pesticides no longer being effective on the insects?","completion":"The process responsible for pesticides no longer being effective on an insect population after repeated use is known as pesticide resistance. This is a result of both the principles of natural selection and genetic variation within the insect population. Here is a detailed explanation of this process: 1. Genetic variation: Insect populations, like all living organisms, have genetic variation among individual members. This variability is a result of random mutations that occur in the DNA of each individual over time. Some of these mutations may confer a selective advantage to an individual, while others may be neutral or even harmful. 2. Exposure to pesticide: When a pesticide is applied to an insect population, it targets specific proteins, enzymes, or biological pathways in the insects, effectively killing or inhibiting their growth. Most of the individuals within the population will be susceptible to the pesticide and die as a result of exposure. 3. Survival of resistant individuals: Due to genetic variation, a small percentage of the insect population may possess a mutation that confers resistance to the pesticide. This resistance can be in the form of reduced sensitivity to the pesticide, altered target sites making it difficult for the pesticide to bind, or the ability to detoxify or metabolize the pesticide more effectively. These resistant individuals will survive the pesticide application while their susceptible peers die off. 4. Reproduction of resistant individuals: Following the reduction in population size after pesticide application, the remaining resistant individuals will reproduce to replenish the population. Since they possess a selective advantage over the susceptible individuals, their offspring will inherit the resistance traits, and the proportion of resistant insects within the population will increase. 5. Repeated pesticide use: When the same pesticide is applied to the insect population repeatedly, it creates a strong selective pressure that favors resistant insects. Over time, the prevalence of resistant individuals within the population increases, reducing the overall efficacy of the pesticide. 6. Resistance spread: Insects are known for their high reproductive rates and ability to disperse, which means that resistant individuals can quickly spread their genes throughout the population, further contributing to the reduced effectiveness of the pesticide. To summarize, pesticide resistance develops as a result of genetic variation within an insect population combined with the selective pressure exerted by the repeated application of a pesticide. This process leads to the survival and reproduction of resistant individuals at the expense of susceptible ones, ultimately reducing the efficacy of the pesticide, and making it less effective in controlling the insect population. As a result, it is essential for pest management programs to employ integrated strategies and rotate the use of different pesticide classes to delay the development of resistance and sustain their effectiveness in controlling insect pests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? cheesy dialogue","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"cheesy dialogue\\" is generally considered negative. The adjective \\"cheesy\\" is used to describe something that is of low quality, clichéd, or lacking originality. It often indicates that the speaker finds the dialogue in question to be trite, predictable, or corny. Therefore, the sentiment is negative since it presents a critical view of the dialogue mentioned. When the term \\"cheesy\\" is applied to something, it implies that the thing being referred to does not meet the standards expected by the person making the statement. It can be used to criticize various aspects of popular culture, such as movies, books, music, and even products or advertising. In this case, it is specifically referring to dialogue, which can either be spoken or written words exchanged between two or more characters in a story, movie, or play. Dialogue is a crucial component of any narrative since it allows the audience to learn about characters, follow the plot, and understand the relationships between the characters. Cheesy dialogue can hinder the audience's connection to the story, making it harder for them to engage with the material. It can also give a sense of laziness or carelessness on the part of the creators, which can negatively impact the overall impression of the work. However, it is essential to consider the context in which the sentence is being used, as the same phrase might be intended to have a different connotation based on who is uttering it and in what situation. For example, if someone appreciates cheesy or campy content for its humorous or nostalgic value, the sentiment could be seen as more positive or neutral. Nonetheless, the most common interpretation of this phrase would be negative due to the implications of poor quality and lack of creativity. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"cheesy dialogue\\" is typically seen as negative, as it expresses dissatisfaction or disdain for the quality of the dialogue in question. It suggests that the dialogue is unoriginal and does not meet the speaker's standards for engaging and compelling content. However, context plays a crucial role in understanding the exact sentiment conveyed, so it is essential to consider the circumstances in which the phrase is used before judging whether it is entirely negative, positive, or neutral."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And the key to this mystery is a sound known as the subglottal resonance . It _ with height and helps us build a mental picture of a person. \\"The best way to think about subglottal resonances is to imagine blowing into a glass bottle with water. The less water in the bottle, the lower sound,\\" said John Morton, a scientist at Washington University. And it's the same for humans. The frequency of the subglottal resonance depends on the height. The taller we are, the deeper the resonance frequency is. In order to find out whether people could identify the resonance, scientists did experiments. A number of same-sex pairs of different heights were told to read the same sentence aloud. It was played back to listeners who had to choose which one of the pairs was taller. Then, other listeners had to rank the speakers from the shortest to the tallest.

Paragraph : Inhaling, or breathing in, increases the size of the chest, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. Question: If Mona is running a race and her chest expands, what happens to the amount of air pressure in her lungs increases or decreases? A:","completion":"When Mona is running a race and experiences chest expansion, the amount of air pressure in her lungs decreases. This phenomenon occurs due to the inhalation process. As Mona breathes in, her chest increases in size, causing the volume within her lungs to expand as well. According to Boyle's Law, which describes the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas at a constant temperature, as the volume of a container (in this case, Mona's lungs) increases, the pressure within the container decreases, and vice versa. This inverse relationship between volume and pressure ensures that, as Mona's chest expands, the pressure inside her lungs decreases. The decreased air pressure inside her lungs generates a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the lungs. The atmospheric pressure then becomes greater than the pressure inside her lungs. As a result, fresh air from the environment flows into Mona's lungs, providing her with the necessary oxygen for respiration and energy production, essential for her muscles to keep running during the race. In summary, when Mona runs a race and her chest expands, the air pressure inside her lungs decreases due to the increase in lung volume according to Boyle's Law. This allows her to intake oxygen-rich air to meet her body's increased demand for respiration and energy production during physical activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One being that it is set in a depressing time and place, and the way Greene depicts his characters, at times, made me sick and I had to put the book down just imagining what they looked like. I really felt depressed while reading this book. It was not uplifting at all. And as Faulkner said in his Nobel Prize Speech 'it is the duty of the writer to uplift the audience and help their spirits soar high.' This book didn't even increase my pulse. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"The product review undeniably conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer explicitly shares their dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the book, which varies from its setting to its character depiction. Firstly, they mention that the book is placed in a 'depressing time and place'—a factor which doesn't seem to resonate well with their reading preferences. This detail points us towards the recipient's unpleasant experience, thus contributing to the overall negative sentiment they're conveying. Secondly, the writer’s manner of portraying characters appears to have had a profoundly unsettling effect on them. It's mentioned that certain descriptions were so appalling that they felt 'sick' and were obliged to put the book down. An overt show of such strong repulsion emphasizes the negative sentiment driving the review. Finally, the reviewer articulates their unhappiness with the book's failure to uplift them or intrigue them in any manner. They even cite a quote by William Faulkner to highlight this disappointment, reiterating the book's inability to fulfill what they perceive as a crucial function of literature—to help uplift the reader's spirit and incite noticeable emotions. The fact that the book didn't excite them or increase their pulse further underscores the extent of their dissatisfaction. In conclusion, the book review expresses a solidly negative sentiment. The reviewer's choice of language, their reaction to the book's various features, and their overall disenchanted reading experience make it amply clear that they didn't derive enjoyment or positive insights from the book. Looking from their perspective, the book seems to be a far cry from their expectations—something that they characterize as 'terrible' and even 'boring.'"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What character has been played by Howard Marion Crawford, Jude Law, Nigel Bruce and, in 2012, Martin Freeman What is the answer?","completion":"The character that has been played by Howard Marion Crawford, Jude Law, Nigel Bruce, and, in 2012, Martin Freeman is Dr. John H. Watson, who is a prominent figure in the Sherlock Holmes series written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He is typically depicted as Sherlock Holmes's best friend and assistant. Howard Marion-Crawford, a British actor, portrayed Dr. Watson in the 1954 television series \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" where the iconic detective was played by Ronald Howard. Crawford offered a classic interpretation of Watson, portraying him as a competent sidekick to Holmes. Nigel Bruce, another English actor, was famous for his portrayal of Dr. Watson in both the film and radio adaptations of Sherlock Holmes between 1939 and 1946. Bruce's interpretation of Watson is perhaps one of the most recognized, with his portrayal emphasizing the character's unfaltering loyalty, though he also emphasized Watson as a rather bumbling and comedic figure. His on-screen chemistry with Basil Rathbone, who played Holmes, is still celebrated today. Jude Law assumed the highly-acknowledged role as Dr. Watson in Guy Ritchie's more recent cinematic adaptations of Sherlock Holmes in 2009 and its sequel in 2011. Law's Watson was capable, reliable, and savvy, providing a strong counterbalance to Robert Downey Jr's quirky interpretation of Holmes. In 2012, Martin Freeman took over the role of Watson in the BBC series \\"Sherlock\\", set in modern-day London. Freeman's Watson, a war veteran and a medical doctor, is shown to be not just an assistant but an equal who contributes significantly to the crime-solving duo. His subtle portrayal presents a multifaceted Watson who is compassionate yet tough, intelligent yet humble, and provides the required grounding to Benedict Cumberbatch's high-functioning sociopath version of Sherlock Holmes. Overall, the character of Dr. Watson has been depicted in numerous ways, with each actor bringing their own interpretation and strengths to the role. Despite the varying portrayals, there are consistencies in every depiction of Dr. Watson, and these primarily revolve around his unwavering loyalty to Holmes and his integral role in their investigations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is because not all of the water intended for the coffee-making process is effectively making its way into the machine, with a portion being lost due to the leakage. The reduced water levels in the machine reservoir will have a direct influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the process of the water passing through the coffee grounds to become coffee. With less water available in the reservoir, the amount of water that can pass through the coffee grounds is limited, resulting in less coffee being produced overall. The lower water levels also mean that the grounds may be under-extracted, which could lead to weaker, less flavorful coffee. Furthermore, the reduced water levels may also affect the infusion of salt added to the grounds (if used) to enhance the flavor. As less water passes through the coffee grounds and salt, the extraction of flavor-enhancing minerals may be reduced, which may lead to a lessened effect of the salt on the taste of the coffee. In summary, the leakage of water in the described coffee-making process will lead to a decrease in the water levels in the coffee machine reservoir. This perturbation has a direct effect on the subsequent stages of the brewing process, resulting in less coffee being produced and potentially weaker, less flavorful coffee. The influence of the salt, in this case, may also be less pronounced due to the lower water levels and reduced extraction of flavor-enhancing minerals."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In its early days the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society. After Beecham's death in 1961 the orchestra's fortunes declined steeply; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra's right to call itself \\"Royal\\" could be withdrawn. Since Beecham's death the RPO has had seven chief conductors, including Rudolf Kempe, Antal Dorati, Andre Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy, and most recently Charles Dutoit. In 1932 the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham had founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), which, with the backing of rich supporters, he ran until 1940, when finances dried up in wartime. Beecham left to conduct in Australia and then the US; the orchestra continued without him after reorganising itself as a self-governing body. On Beecham's return to England in September 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham responded, \\"I emphatically refuse to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career.\\" In 1945 he conducted the first concert of Walter Legge's new Philharmonia Orchestra, but was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO. His new orchestra to rival the Philharmonia would, he told Legge, be launched in \\"the most auspicious circumstances and eclat\\". In 1946 Beecham reached an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society: his new orchestra would replace the LPO at all the Society's concerts. He thus gained the right to name the new ensemble the \\"Royal Philharmonic Orchestra\\", an arrangement approved by George VI. Beecham arranged with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne seasons. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated. The music critic Lyndon Jenkins writes: Naturally, it quickly became known that he was planning another orchestra, at which the cry \\"He'll never get the players!\\" went up just as it had done in 1932. Beecham was unmoved: \\"I always get the players,\\" he retorted. \\"Among other considerations, they are so good they refuse to play under anybody but me\\".

Please answer the following question: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. Doctor Jones studied two teams of workers.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors? ? In Sweden, juries are uncommon; the public is represented in the courts by means of lay judges (nämndemän). However, the defendant has the right to a jury trial in the lower court (tingsrätt) when accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press. If a person is accused of e.g. libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred, in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), she has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors. This applies also in civil (tort) cases under the fundamental laws. A majority of at least six jurors must find that the defendant has committed the alleged crime. If it does not, the defendant is acquitted or, in a civil case, held not liable. If such a majority of the jurors hold that said crime has in fact been committed, this finding is not legally binding for the court; thus, the court (three judges) can still acquit the defendant or find him/her not liable. A jury acquittal may not be overruled after appeal. In Swedish civil process, the \\"English rule\\" applies to court costs. Earlier, a court disagreeing with a jury acquittal could, when deciding on the matter of such costs, set aside the English rule, and instead use the American rule, that each party bears its own expense of litigation. This practice was declared to violate the rule of presumption of innocence according to article 6.2. of the European Convention on Human Rights, by the Supreme Court of Sweden, in 2012. The answer is:","completion":"In Sweden, a person accused of an offense against the fundamental laws on freedom of expression and freedom of the press, such as libel or incitement to ethnic or racial hatred in a medium covered by the fundamental laws (e.g. a printed paper or a radio programme), has the right to have the accusation tried by a jury of nine jurors.

Question: suppose less birth control pills used happens, how will it affect MORE igneous rock forming. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"To analyze the relationship between the use of birth control pills and the formation of igneous rocks, we need to consider the steps and factors involved in both processes: 1. Birth control pill usage: This is related to human population control and management. It directly affects the number of births and indirectly impacts resource usage, including any potential impact on the geological processes. 2. Igneous rock formation: As described in the given process, igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of magma. Factors affecting igneous rock formation mainly include volcanic activity, temperature, pressure, and the composition of the magma. Considering these two processes, there is no apparent direct connection between the use of birth control pills and the formation of igneous rocks. It's worth noting that human activities may have indirect effects on the planet's geology, climate, and ecosystems.

Options: - television - attic - corner - they cannot clean corner and library during football match they cannot need that - ground Explain why a human would choose \\"television\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human would choose \\"television\\" as the answer to the question above for several reasons. The question refers to preventing glare during a big football game and the context of watching a football game gives us a solid clue to choose \\"television\\" among the given options. Firstly, watching a football game, especially a big one, is typically an activity enjoyed by spectators on a television screen. Whether they are at home, at a friend's house or in a sports bar, the most common and convenient way for people to watch the game is on a television. This allows them to view the game comfortably, follow all the action closely, and even hear the commentary for a more informed and immersive experience. Secondly, glare can be a significant issue while watching a football game on a television screen, especially if the screen is dusty or the room has direct sunlight or bright LED lights shining on it. Glare on the television screen may cause difficulty in seeing the game clearly or may create an uncomfortable viewing experience. In order to fully enjoy the big football game, it is crucial to have a clear and unobstructed view of the screen without any glare obstructing the visuals. Among the options provided, cleaning an attic, a corner, or a library are irrelevant to the context of watching a football game and preventing glare. The ground, on the other hand, could refer to the football stadium, but it is not the responsibility of an individual watching the game to clean the stadium. Moreover, cleaning the stadium would not prevent glare for those watching the game from home or elsewhere on television. Therefore, it makes perfect sense for a human to choose \\"television\\" as the answer since cleaning the dust off a television helps reduce glare on the screen, providing a better and more enjoyable viewing experience during the big football game. By ensuring that the television screen is clean and dust-free, the viewer can enjoy the football match without any distractions, focusing on the excitement that the game brings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His parents were Rabbi Mayer Samuel Weisz (1829-1892) and Cecilia Steiner (1841-1913). Houdini was one of seven children: Herman M. (1863-1885) who was Houdini's half-brother, by Rabbi Weisz's first marriage; Nathan J. (1870-1927); Gottfried William (1872-1925); Theodore (1876-1945); Leopold D. (1879-1962); and Carrie Gladys (1882-1959), who was left almost blind after a childhood accident. Weisz arrived in the United States on July 3, 1878, on the SS Fresia with his mother (who was pregnant) and his four brothers. In 1904, the London Daily Mirror newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinee performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \\"ghost house\\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56 minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the 6-inch key Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career. After Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship. This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's Mysteries at the Museum in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum. A full-sized design of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the Bramah style key for it, is on display to the public at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Two villages experienced flooding this spring. Berg village used many sandbags to protect from the dam overflowing. Creek village didn't use any sandbags, they were caught by surprise. But I can use this background: People protect areas that might flood with dams. In dire situations, they use sandbags ( Figure below ). Dams are usually very effective, but high water levels sometimes cause a dam to break. In that case, flooding can be catastrophic. Flood waters can also overflow a dam. People may line a river bank with levees to protect against floods. These are high walls that keep the stream within its banks during floods. Flood protection in one location sometimes causes problems elsewhere. For example, a levee in one location may just force the high water upstream or downstream. This will lead to flooding in a different location. Sometimes water gets so high that the river must be allowed to flood. What is an answer for this question: Which village was more affected by the dam overflowing? The answer is:","completion":"Creek village was more affected by the dam overflowing. The background information provided highlights various flood protection measures that people employ to protect areas from flooding. In the case of Berg village and Creek village, both experienced flooding due to the dam overflowing this spring. However, their response to the situation and subsequent impacts varied greatly. Berg village was proactive in their approach and used sandbags to protect their area from the dam overflowing. Sandbags are a common and effective method of flood protection. They can be stacked to create a temporary barrier that helps to prevent or reduce water flow into the protected area. While sandbags may not completely eliminate the risk of flooding, they can certainly mitigate the level of potential damage by decreasing the amount of water that enters the community and protecting vital infrastructure or buildings. On the other hand, Creek village did not use any sandbags to protect their area, as they were caught by surprise. Without this added protection, Creek village was likely more vulnerable to the full force of the flood waters and may have experienced a higher degree of damage and destruction. The lack of sandbags would have allowed water to flow more freely into the community, resulting in a greater amount of water infiltration, damage to structures, and potential danger to residents. Furthermore, high walls like levees mentioned in the background information are also employed to protect against floods, but it is not clear if either village used such a protection measure. If neither village had levees, then Creek village being unprotected by sandbags added to their vulnerability during the dam overflow. In conclusion, given their lack of preparation and absence of sandbag barriers to protect their area during the dam overflow, Creek village was more affected by the flooding than Berg village. While Berg village's proactive use of sandbags likely reduced the overall impact of the flood in their area, Creek village was more exposed and therefore faced more significant consequences from the overflow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: -unacceptable. -acceptable.","completion":"The linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence, \\"John sang a song and danced to the music,\\" can be categorized as acceptable. Here is the detailed analysis to support this classification based on several linguistic dimensions: 1. Syntax: The sentence follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) structure commonly used in English sentences. \\"John\\" serves as the subject, \\"sang\\" as the main verb, and \\"a song\\" as the object in the first part of the sentence. The sentence's second part follows a similar pattern with \\"danced\\" as the verb and \\"the music\\" as the object. Overall, the syntactical structure is sound and allows readers or listeners to understand the actions performed by the subject. 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence conveys a clear meaning. The verbs \\"sang\\" and \\"danced\\" succinctly convey the actions John is performing, while the objects \\"a song\\" and \\"the music\\" specify what he is singing and dancing to, respectively. The conjunction \\"and\\" connects these two parts, effectively communicating that John performed both actions simultaneously or consecutively. As a result, the sentence has a coherent and intelligible semantic structure. 3. Grammar: Grammatically, the sentence uses proper verb tenses, articles, and pronouns. The past tense forms of the verbs \\"sing\\" and \\"dance\\" are utilized correctly to depict John's actions in the past. The indefinite article \\"a\\" preceding \\"song\\" and the definite article \\"the\\" preceding \\"music\\" exemplify appropriate usage as well. Hence, the grammar in this sentence is correct and consistent. 4. Punctuation: The punctuation within the sentence is also fitting. The full stop (period) at the end marks the sentence's conclusion, and no other punctuation marks are necessary since the sentence's meaning is concise and readily comprehensible. The sentence does not contain any complex structures that might require additional punctuation. 5. Readability and Style: The sentence is easily readable and adheres to a simple, clear style. Using two verbs (\\"sang\\" and \\"danced\\") and their respective objects (\\"a song\\" and \\"the music\\") allows the reader or listener to quickly grasp John's actions without confusion. The conjunction \\"and\\" also helps maintain a smooth narrative flow by linking the two related actions. Given the above analysis, the linguistic integrity of the sentence is acceptable as it has a well-structured syntax, conveys a clear meaning, follows grammatical rules, uses appropriate punctuation, and has an easily digestible style."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tomin A:","completion":"Title: The Enigma of Vala Genre: Romance, Sci-Fi, Adventure Plot: Part 1: Introducing the Protagonists In the year 2137, the Earth is now facing overpopulation and resource depletion. Due to this impending crisis, an advanced international space organization, called the Global Aerospace Alliance (GAA), embarks on a mission to search for habitable planets in an effort to ensure humanity's survival. Vala Crain is a brilliant and skilled astronaut from the GAA, selected to be the mission's technical lead. With a profound sense of exploration and a strong desire to contribute to this mission's success, she is fearless, taking on each challenge with determination and grace. Tomin Dallas, a highly regarded aerospace engineer, is assigned to work alongside Vala. Despite being a reserved and introverted person, Tomin's passion for engineering space travel technology has earned him a position in the GAA mission. Part 2: The Mission As Vala and Tomin work closely during preparation for the mission, they begin to develop strong feelings for each other. However, due to the intensity and high stakes of their work, they feel it is inappropriate to act on these feelings and maintain a strictly professional relationship. With the spaceship \\"The Genesis\\" ready for launch, all crew members are invited to a farewell party before leaving Earth. Despite their undeclared fascination for each other, Vala and Tomin share a dance and a deep conversation about their hopes and fears. Their bond deepens, as they embrace the uncertainty of the perilous journey ahead. Part 3: The Enigma As the mission progresses, The Genesis approaches an undiscovered and intriguing planet hidden behind a nebula, which they name Enigma. The crew members, captivated by the prospect of finding a new home, send a landing crew, including Vala and Tomin, to further investigate its potential habitability. Upon landing on Enigma, the crew discovers that the planet holds a secret - it has a unique property that cures every known illness, diseases and even aging. This astounding revelation leads to divided opinions among the crew members, with some believing that they shouldn't disrupt this unique ecosystem, while others argue that they could save humanity and rejuvenate Earth with its healing powers. Part 4: The Pivotal Moment With the dilemma weighing heavy on them, Vala reaches the tipping point and questions whether humanity deserves the power to utilize such a resource at the cost of Enigma's purity. Tomin, torn between his love for Vala and his commitment to humanity's survival, is asked by Vala to make a decision. Despite the magnitude of the situation, he chooses to ask Vala to stay with him on Enigma, abandoning their mission and letting Earth fend for itself. Part 5: The Resolution This proposal deeply shakes Vala, whose sole purpose since childhood has been to protect Earth and contribute to humanity's survival. She struggles with the thought of leaving behind her life's work, despite her genuine love for Tomin. In the end, she recognizes that there is more to living than solely focusing on one's duty, and that love and happiness should be a part of it. She agrees to stay with Tomin on Enigma, but with one condition: they must work together towards finding a solution that protects Enigma while benefiting humanity. The movie ends with Vala and Tomin, hand in hand, as they begin a new life on Enigma, devoted to each other and their shared mission to find a solution for the coexistence of humanity and the newly discovered planet."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Hundreds of... (Associated Press) The mob of men beat 27-year-old Farkhunda before throwing her body off a roof, running over it with a car, setting it on fire and throwing it into a river near a well-known mosque. The attack was apparently sparked by allegations that Farkhunda, who like many Afghans has just one name, had set fire to a Quran. But Afghanistan's most senior detective said no evidence had been found to support those claims. Video of the assault taken with cellphones has circulated widely since the attack on Thursday. The killing has shocked many Afghans and led to renewed calls for justice and reform. \\"We want justice for Farkhunda, we want justice for Afghan women. All these injustices happening to Afghan women are unacceptable,\\" said a prominent women's rights activist who goes by the name Dr. Alima. \\"In which religion or faith is it acceptable to burn a person to death? Today is a day of national mourning and we will not keep quiet.\\" President Ashraf Ghani, now in Washington on his first state visit to the United States since taking office in September, condemned the killing as a \\"heinous attack\\" and ordered an investigation. Following allegations that police stood by and did nothing to stop the killing, Ghani told reporters before leaving for the U.S. that the incident revealed \\"a fundamental issue\\" — that security forces are too focused on the fight against the Taliban insurgency to concentrate on community policing. Many rights activists, however, said the killing cut to the core of how women are treated as second-class citizens in Afghan society. Despite constitutional guarantees of equal rights and advances in access to health and education, for many women in Afghanistan little has changed since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion ended the Taliban's harsh rule. Girls are routinely married off as children, traded as chattels and then rarely permitted to leave their homes without a male relative. Hundreds of people gathered at a graveyard Sunday in the middle-class suburb near Farkhunda's home. With the permission of her father, the women in black carried her coffin from an ambulance to an open-air prayer ground, and then to her grave, rituals that are usually attended only by men. \\"She is a sister to you all, and it is your duty to bury her,\\" Farkhunda's brother Najibullah, standing graveside, told the crowd. Several politicians, officials and senior police officers addressed the funeral, which was broadcast live. Men formed a chain around the women pallbearers to offer protection and support. The attack appeared to have grown out of a dispute between Farkhunda, a veiled woman who had just finished a degree in religious studies and was preparing to take a teaching post, and men who sold amulets at Shah-Do Shamshera shrine, where the killing happened. She regarded the amulet sellers as parasites and told women not to waste their money on them, friends and family said. Her father, Mohammed Nadir, said the men responded by making false accusations that she had torched a Quran. \\"Based on their lies, people decided Farkhunda was not a Muslim and beat her to death,\\" he said. The Interior Ministry said it was providing extra protection for the family. The head of the ministry's criminal investigation directorate, Gen. Mohammad Zahir, said 13 people had been arrested in connection with the killing, including two men who sold amulets. The Interior Ministry said 13 policemen had been suspended pending investigation. Zahir said authorities were \\"unable to find any single iota of evidence to support claims that she had burned a Quran.\\" \\"She is completely innocent,\\" he said. ___ Follow Lynne O'Donnell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/lynnekodonnell ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption Women's rights and civil society activists helped bury Farkhunda at the funeral in Kabul The coffin of a woman, killed by a mob in Kabul on an apparently false charge, has been carried by women, marking a break with Afghan funeral customs. Hundreds of people attended a funeral for the woman, named as Farkhunda, demanding her killers be punished. Farkhunda had been accused of burning the Koran, but an official investigator said there was no evidence for this. The attack on the woman, as well as the alleged failure of police to intervene, have been heavily criticised. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said he had ordered an investigation into the killing. Footage of the attack, filmed on mobile phones, has been widely circulated on social media. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The mourners demanded justice for Farkhunda Image copyright Reuters Image caption A relative said Farkhunda, seen here on a placard at the funeral, was training to become a teacher A mob, largely made up of men, attacked the woman with sticks and stones, beating her to death before setting her body alight, while police reportedly looked on. Witnesses said the crowd had accused the woman of burning a copy of the Koran. The attack, near the Shah-Du-Shamshaira mosque and shrine, is thought to have been the first of its kind in Afghanistan. At the funeral on Sunday, women's activists carried the coffin, breaking with tradition as men usually perform that role. An interior ministry official in charge of investigating the case said he had found no evidence that the woman had burnt the Koran. \\"Farkhunda was totally innocent,\\" Gen Mohammad Zahir told reporters. He said 13 people, including eight police officers, had been arrested. Image copyright AFP Image caption A blackened area by the river marks the spot where the woman's body was burned Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The woman was attacked outside the Shah-Du-Shamshaira mosque in Kabul Earlier claims that the woman was mentally ill have also been contradicted by a relative and a neighbour. Farkhunda's brother told Reuters news agency that his sister was training to be a religious teacher. He said her father had said she was ill after hearing of her death, out of a desire to protect the rest of the family. A neighbour of the family, interviewed by the Associated Press, also said the woman had no history of mental problems and had been training as a teacher. The US has spent millions of dollars on programmes designed to empower and educate Afghan women. However, women in much of the country still suffer discrimination, and attacks on them often go unpunished. ||||| KABUL A woman killed by an angry mob in front of police in the Afghan capital last week for allegedly burning a copy of Islam's holy book was wrongly accused, Afghanistan's top criminal investigator said on Sunday. Mobile phone footage circulating on social media shows police at the scene did not save the 27-year-old woman, Farkhunda, who was beaten with sticks and set on fire by a crowd of men in central Kabul in broad daylight on Thursday. \\"Last night I went through all documents and evidence once again, but I couldn’t find any evidence to say Farkhunda burnt the Holy Koran,\\" General Mohammad Zahir told reporters at her funeral on Sunday. \\"Farkhunda was totally innocent.\\" The top criminal investigator promised to punish all those involved and said 13 people, including eight police officers, had already been arrested. The killing was condemned by the Afghan president and other officials, but also drew praise from some quarters, including from a prominent cleric, who asserted the men had a right to defend their Muslim beliefs at all costs. Farkhunda was a teacher of Islamic studies, according to her brother, who denied media reports that she had been mentally ill. He said this was a made-up defense by their father, who wanted to protect the family after police told them to leave the city for their own safety. \\"My father was frightened and made the false statement to calm people down,\\" said Najibullah, who is changing his second name to Farkhunda in memory of his sister. Hundreds of people attended her funeral on Sunday chanting \\"we want justice\\" and her coffin was carried by women. The United States and other countries have spent millions of dollars in Afghanistan on promoting the rule of law, justice and women's rights since the Taliban were ousted in 2001. Under the strict Islamist rule of the Taliban, women could neither attend school nor were they allowed to work, and were forbidden from leaving the house without a male guardian. The last decade has seen much progress: Millions of girls now attend school and women can enter employment, particularly in major cities. But in some rural areas, little has changed and hardwon rights are at risk of being reversed as aid and foreign troops are withdrawn.

News article: AstraZeneca Is Launching a Massive Gene Hunt With This Genome Pioneer AstraZeneca, working with genome pioneer Craig Venter, is launching a massive gene hunt in the most comprehensive bet yet by a pharmaceutical firm on the potential of genetic variations to unlock routes to new medicines. The initiative, announced on Friday, involves sequencing up to 2 million human genomes—the complete set of genetic code that acts as the software of life—including 500,000 DNA samples collected by AstraZeneca in global clinical trials. Financial details of the 10-year project were not disclosed but Mene Pangalos, head of early drug development, said the company would be investing “hundreds of millions of dollars.” AstraZeneca azncf aims to identify rare genetic mutations involved in every kind of disease by scanning DNA from volunteers who agreed to have their genomes sequenced and to provide access to detailed medical records. The project is made possible by a dramatic fall in the cost of genetic sequencing. It took government-funded scientists 3 billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003. Today, it costs around 1,000 and takes just three days. AstraZeneca will work with Venter’s U.S. company Human Longevity Inc (HLI), which will sequence the genomes, including 1 million from HLI’s database, and use machine-learning software to find patterns in genetic variations. The British group, which is establishing an in-house Centre for Genomics Research in Cambridge, where it is relocating its global headquarters, has also partnered with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Finland’s Institute for Molecular Medicine. AstraZeneca is not the first drugmaker to start amassing troves of human DNA in this way but Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome, said it was the biggest commitment to date by any pharmaceutical company. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals signed a deal with Pennsylvania’s Geisinger Health System two years ago to sequence partial genomes of some 250,000 volunteers, while Roche’s Genentech unit signed a deal last year for HLI to sequence tens of thousands of genomes. “The big thing here is the magnitude of what we are trying to do,” Pangalos said. “This takes it to a completely different level and I think it is going to be relevant of every therapeutic area.” Until now, the field of genomics has largely failed to live up to the hype of hoped-for medical breakthroughs, although more recently genetic understanding has been crucial in the development of some cancer treatments. Now, thanks to industrial-scale sequencing and advances in gene editing that allow scientists to quickly test the effects of genetic variations, progress is expected to accelerate. Venter believes it could also unleash a new era of forensics, with HLI trying to predict what people might look like from their DNA. AstraZeneca’s decision to embed genomics across its research and development follows a push last year by the company to expand gene testing into areas including heart disease and asthma. “I believe we really have finally turned the corner and genomics will become central in drug development efforts,” said David Goldstein, a genetics expert from Columbia University, who chairs AstraZeneca’s Genomics Advisory Board.

MPEG audio may use bitrate switching on a per-frame basis, but only layer III decoders must support it. VBR is used when the goal is to achieve a fixed level of quality. The final file size of a VBR encoding is less predictable than with constant bitrate. Average bitrate is VBR implemented as a compromise between the two: the bitrate is allowed to vary for more consistent quality, but is controlled to remain near an average value chosen by the user, for predictable file sizes. Although an MP3 decoder must support VBR to be standards compliant, historically some decoders have bugs with VBR decoding, particularly before VBR encoders became widespread.

Context: The long-awaited takeover of Universal Pictures by MCA, Inc. happened in mid-1962 as part of the MCA-Decca Records merger. The company reverted in name to Universal Pictures. As a final gesture before leaving the talent agency business, virtually every MCA client was signed to a Universal contract. In 1964 MCA formed Universal City Studios, Inc., merging the motion pictures and television arms of Universal Pictures Company and Revue Productions (officially renamed as Universal Television in 1966). And so, with MCA in charge, Universal became a full-blown, A-film movie studio, with leading actors and directors under contract; offering slick, commercial films; and a studio tour subsidiary launched in 1964. Television production made up much of the studio's output, with Universal heavily committed, in particular, to deals with NBC (which later merged with Universal to form NBC Universal; see below) providing up to half of all prime time shows for several seasons. An innovation during this period championed by Universal was the made-for-television movie.

It’s a lot safer too. The reason why the second answer is more reasonable is because of the following considerations and benefits it presents: 1. Flexibility: By temporarily attaching the carrier board, you provide yourself the flexibility to remove it when it is no longer needed. This is especially helpful if you only require the additional width for a few cuts or if your workshop space is limited. 2. Preservation of board integrity: Permanently attaching a carrier board may result in damage to the original board if it ever needs to be removed. On the other hand, temporary attachment ensures the preservation of the original board and carrier board for future use or other projects. 3. Safety: Both options mention that attaching a carrier board provides a safer way to make long cuts. However, a temporary attachment reduces the likelihood of errors or accidents, especially if the carrier board becomes damaged or no longer serves its purpose effectively. 4. Easy adjustments and alignments: With a temporary attachment, adjustments to the boards can be easily made without the risk of damaging the board or the need for a complete fix to the carrier board. This method also allows you to make more accurate cuts by making small adjustments as needed while cutting through the narrow boards. 5. Cost-effective and resourceful: Since the carrier board is not permanently attached, it can be repurposed for other woodworking projects. This not only makes the most out of your existing materials but also cuts down on the overall cost of your projects. 6. Versatility: By temporarily attaching a carrier board to your narrow boards, it's easier to interchange or replace them when needed, given the different dimensions and requirements of each project you work on. To conclude, while both options might seem viable at first glance, temporary attachment of a carrier board to the narrow board emerges as the more reasonable method to make long cuts due to its flexibility, preservation of board integrity, safety, easy adjustments and alignments, cost-effectiveness, and versatility. By using this method, you can achieve your goal in a more efficient and secure manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

He stayed on the islands for five weeks, observing various animals. This finally inspired his famous work,On the Origin of Species. You can certainly follow Darwin's footsteps and enjoy a trip from four to seven days to the islands. The islands are certainly a paradise for wildlife, as there are no natural killers on the islands and the number of boats and visitors is under government control. Though you cannot walk freely as Darwin did about 200 years ago, each day is as impressive as it could be. The most well-known animals of the Galapagos is the giant tortoise , which can be seen moving slowly around the highlands of Santa Cruz, the second largest island in the archipelago . Some of these creatures are so old that they might have been seen in their youth by Darwin himself. Despite strict control over activities and timing, your stay on the Galapagos will be remembered as a chain of incomparable pictures: diving with sea lions that swim and play within inches of you; feeling small sharks touch your feet as you swim; and, most magically, seeing a whale and her baby surface with a great breath of air. Travelling between the islands and observing the wildlife that so inspired Darwin, you will feel as though you are getting a special view of an untouched world. At night you will sleep on board the ship, leaving the wildlife in complete occupation of the islands, which are as undisturbed now as they have been since the beginning of time.

Movie title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt has ordered the death of all the firstborn Hebrew male infants after hearing the prophecy of the Deliverer, but a Hebrew mother named Yoshebel saves her own infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel. Moses institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slaves on the project, and eventually Prince Rameses, Moses's \\"brother\\", charges him with planning an insurrection, pointing out that the slaves are calling him the \\"Deliverer\\". Moses defends himself against the charges, arguing that he is simply making his workers more productive by making them stronger and happier and proves his point with the impressive progress he is making. Rameses had earlier been charged by Sethi with finding out whether there really is a Hebrew fitting the description of the Deliverer.

Write an article based on this \\"Eat more foods high in omega-3s. Try intermittent fasting. Incorporate curcumin into your diet. Increase your intake of blueberries. Use supplements. Avoid foods high in sugar and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).\\" Article:","completion":"Title: 6 Lifestyle Changes to Boost Brain Health Introduction Incorporating certain dietary and lifestyle changes can boost brain health and improve cognitive performance. Many people are unaware of the simple changes they can make to maintain a healthy mind and slow down cognitive decline. In this article, we will explore six science-based recommendations that can lead to improved memory, sharper focus, and enhanced well-being. These changes include consuming more foods rich in omega-3s, trying intermittent fasting, adding curcumin to your diet, increasing blueberry intake, using supplements, and avoiding high-sugar foods and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). 1. Eat More Foods High in Omega-3s Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients that play an important role in maintaining brain function and overall health. These nutrients can be found in fatty fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines, as well as plant-based sources like walnuts, flax seeds, and chia seeds. Research has shown that increased omega-3 intake can improve memory, combat depression, and reduce the risk of cognitive decline. Aim to include at least two servings of fatty fish per week or incorporate plant-based omega-3 sources into your daily meal plan. 2. Try Intermittent Fasting Intermittent fasting (IF) is a popular eating pattern that involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. Research suggests that IF may promote brain health by reducing inflammation, increasing the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and promoting autophagy, a process that clears damaged cells from the brain. There are several methods of IF, such as the 16/8 method (fasting for 16 hours and eating during an 8-hour window), so choose the one that works best for your lifestyle and consult with a healthcare professional before starting. 3. Incorporate Curcumin into Your Diet Curcumin, the active component in the spice turmeric, has been shown to possess powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. A growing body of research indicates that curcumin may help to protect the brain from neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, improve mood, and support cognitive function. Incorporate turmeric in your diet by adding it to curries, soups, or even smoothies. Consider a high-quality curcumin supplement as well, but consult with a doctor before starting any new supplement regimen. 4. Increase Your Intake of Blueberries Blueberries are not just a delicious fruit, but they also pack a powerful punch for brain health. Rich in antioxidants known as flavonoids, blueberries can help to reduce inflammation, protect the brain from oxidative stress, and improve memory and cognitive function. Add blueberries to your diet by enjoying them as a snack, topping your oatmeal or yogurt, or incorporating them into smoothies and salads. Aim for at least one serving of blueberries per day to maximize their benefits. 5. Use Supplements While a well-balanced diet can provide many of the nutrients needed for optimal brain health, supplements can help fill any gaps. Popular brain-boosting supplements include omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E. Before starting any new supplement regimen, consult with a healthcare professional to determine which supplements are most appropriate for your needs and to ensure there are no potential interactions with medications you may be taking. 6. Avoid Foods High in Sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) A diet high in sugar and HFCS has been linked to an increased risk of cognitive decline, poor memory, and the development of conditions such as Alzheimer's and dementia. To promote brain health and reduce the adverse effects of sugar on cognition, limit your intake of added sugars, and avoid foods with HFCS. This may include cutting down on sugary beverages, candy, baked goods, and processed snacks. Conclusion Boosting brain health and cognitive performance may be as simple as incorporating a few key dietary and lifestyle changes. By focusing on nutrient-rich foods, adopting healthy eating patterns, and avoiding foods that contribute to cognitive decline, you can take the first steps toward a sharper and more vibrant mind. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new dietary or supplement regimen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: In 1880, Bell received the Volta Prize with a purse of 50,000 francs (approximately US250,000 in today's dollars) for the invention of the telephone from the Académie française, representing the French government. Among the luminaries who judged were Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas. The Volta Prize was conceived by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1801, and named in honor of Alessandro Volta, with Bell receiving the third grand prize in its history. Since Bell was becoming increasingly affluent, he used his prize money to create endowment funds (the 'Volta Fund') and institutions in and around the United States capital of Washington, D.C.. These included the prestigious 'Volta Laboratory Association' (1880), also known as the Volta Laboratory and as the 'Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory', and which eventually led to the Volta Bureau (1887) as a center for studies on deafness which is still in operation in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. The Volta Laboratory became an experimental facility devoted to scientific discovery, and the very next year it improved Edison's phonograph by substituting wax for tinfoil as the recording medium and incising the recording rather than indenting it, key upgrades that Edison himself later adopted. The laboratory was also the site where he and his associate invented his \\"proudest achievement\\", \\"the photophone\\", the \\"optical telephone\\" which presaged fibre optical telecommunications, while the Volta Bureau would later evolve into the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (the AG Bell), a leading center for the research and pedagogy of deafness.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is it that Frank Culpepper will have none of and, instead, decide to kill the rustlers? Ben Mockridge is a young man proud of his 4 handgun and enamored of \\"cowboyin'\\". He asks Frank Culpepper if he can join his cattle drive to Fort Lewis, Colorado. Culpepper (a reformed gunslinger) reluctantly agrees and sends Ben to the cook to be his \\"little Mary\\". Ben quickly discovers that the adults have little interest in young'ns, and no interest in \\"showing him the ropes\\". Culpepper nevertheless assigns Ben tasks the greenhorn handles poorly—or simply fails at—repeatedly causing serious trouble. After rustlers stampede the herd, Culpepper tracks them to a box canyon. When the rustlers' leader demands 50 cents a head for having rounded up and taken care of the cattle, Culpepper will have none of it. He and his hands kill the rustlers, not hesitating to gun down disarmed men, or repeatedly shoot anyone still moving. They lose four of their own in the fight. Culpepper directs Ben to a cantina a day's ride off, to find Russ Caldwell. Before he can reach the cantina, Ben is accosted by trappers who take his horse and gun. Once Ben finds Caldwell, he and three of his buddies agree to join the drive. When they cross the trappers' path, there is no parlaying—they immediately kill the trappers and take their possessions. When Ben stands night watch, he's unprepared for a one-eyed man trying to steal the horses. Instead of immediately shooting him, Ben lets the man distract him with his talk, and is overcome by another thief. Culpepper is outraged at Ben's stupidity.

Ferguson remained in Liberia , Monrovia in 1916 until his death in 1968 . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other, although they share similarities in terms of subject matter and structure. They contain different information in terms of the years mentioned, which leads to discrepancies in their meanings. Let's break down the key differences between the two sentences: 1. Ferguson stayed in Monrovia until his death in 1916 in Liberia. In this sentence, we learn that Ferguson stayed in Monrovia until he passed away in 1916. Monrovia is situated within Liberia. Therefore, the sentence informs us that Ferguson lived in Monrovia, Liberia, until his death in 1916. 2. Ferguson remained in Liberia, Monrovia, in 1916 until his death in 1968. This sentence notes that Ferguson was in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1916 and stayed there until his death in 1968. It emphasizes the presence of Ferguson in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1916 and that he continued to live there until he died in 1968, which is a different year from the first sentence. In summary, these sentences convey different information about when Ferguson died and thus are not paraphrases of one another. The first sentence states Ferguson died in 1916, while the second sentence indicates his death occurred in 1968."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals","completion":"To determine whether the phrase \\"fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals\\" is positive or negative, let's break down the meaning of the phrase step-by-step: 1. \\"Fails\\" - This indicates a negative result, as it implies unsuccessful performance or lack of achievement. 2. \\"to fulfill\\" - This suggests the inability to complete or achieve something, which typically carries a negative connotation. 3. \\"its own\\" - This part of the phrase implies self-ownership, meaning the subject was trying to achieve something for itself. 4. \\"ambitious goals\\" - This part implies that the goals were challenging and could be seen as admirable. Now, consider the overall tone and impression created by combining these elements. While the \\"ambitious goals\\" part may carry positive undertones, the overall focus is on the subject's failure to achieve them, emphasizing a lack of accomplishment. Combining the negative connotations regarding the failure with the subject's own goals, the entire phrase has a negative slant. Justification: The overall essence of the phrase, when put together, emphasizes the failure to achieve ambitious goals, which creates a more negative connotation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve -795*r - 216 = -777*r for r.","completion":"Okay, let's solve this step by step, like a puzzle, to find the value of 'r'. Here's the math problem: -795*r - 216 = -777*r 1. First, we need to move all 'r' terms to one side of the equation. Let's move the -777*r from the right side to the left side. We do this by adding 777*r to both sides: -795*r + 777*r - 216 = -777*r + 777*r 2. Now our equation looks like this: (-795 + 777)*r - 216 = 0 3. Now, let's solve -795 + 777: -18*r - 216 = 0 4. Next, we need to move 216 to the right side of the equation. We do this by adding 216 to both sides: -18*r - 216 + 216 = 0 + 216 5. Now our equation looks like this: -18*r = 216 6. Finally, we need to find the value of 'r'. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -18: -18*r / (-18) = 216 / (-18) 7. Now our equation looks like this: r = -12 So, after solving the puzzle, we find out that the value of 'r' is -12."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The March 2000 edition had a French issue , and in 2002 a bound edition appeared .","completion":"Yes, the two sentences are conveying the same meaning, although they have a slightly different structure and choice of words. Let's break down the similarities and differences between the two sentences to better understand their meaning. 1. \\"The March 2000 issue had a French edition\\": This part of the sentence states that there was a unique version of the March 2000 issue, which was translated into French, implying the existence of a separate edition in the French language. 1. \\"The March 2000 edition had a French issue\\": This part conveys the same message as the first sentence, but the words \\"edition\\" and \\"issue\\" are reversed. The meaning remains the same – there was a unique French version of the March 2000 edition. 2. \\"and a hardcover 'limited' edition appeared in 2002\\": This part of the first sentence implies that a special \\"limited\\" edition was published in 2002, and its distinct feature was that it had a hardcover binding, rather than the usual softcover. 2. \\"and in 2002 a bound edition appeared\\": This part of the second sentence conveys a similar message as the first, with a slight difference. The term \\"bound edition\\" is used here instead of \\"hardcover 'limited' edition\\". The word \\"bound\\" can refer to any type of bookbinding, including hardcover, but it does not specifically mention that it was a limited edition. However, the context suggests that the bound edition is likely a limited or special edition of the publication. In conclusion, while there are minor changes in the way the two sentences are structured, and the word choice differs somewhat, the overall meaning remains the same. Both sentences communicate that a French version of the March 2000 issue/edition was published, and in 2002, a special edition with a more durable binding (likely a limited hardcover edition) was produced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can't imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in Le Locataire, yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people, myself included. Polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters (Deneuve in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire), starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise. The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there's no tangible supernatural element here. While horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis (be it cheap or more elaborate) Polanski sadistically tortures us and, if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats. Suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations (alternatively fooling and fulfilling them), not literally with people's nerves. In my book Rosemary's Baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat, while we are forced to identify with a sole character. What's more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we, the viewers, are compelled to judge him, reject him while we have been masterfully lured (\\"paint 'n lure\\") into being him.","completion":"This person's opinion about the movies \\"Repulsion\\" and \\"Le Locataire\\" (The Tenant) directed by Roman Polanski is mostly positive.

Their final trick appears to transport one of the audience members to the vault of their bank, the CrÃ©dit RÃ©publicain in Paris, where stacks of new euro bills are stored. At the magicians' commands, the fans in the vault activate, drawing the bills into the vents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them.

The path to independence for the white colonies of the British Empire began with the 1839 Durham Report, which proposed unification and self-government for Upper and Lower Canada, as a solution to political unrest there. This began with the passing of the Act of Union in 1840, which created the Province of Canada. Responsible government was first granted to Nova Scotia in 1848, and was soon extended to the other British North American colonies. With the passage of the British North America Act, 1867 by the British Parliament, Upper and Lower Canada, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia were formed into the Dominion of Canada, a confederation enjoying full self-government with the exception of international relations.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: Choose from: (A). negative (B). positive TEXT:In a famous essay he wrote about Charles Dickens, George Orwell points out that many readers always regretted that Dickens never continued writing like he did in PICKWICK PAPERS: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. This would not have been too difficult for Dickens. His contemporary Robert Surtees did precisely that, only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (MR. FANCY ROMFORD'S HOUNDS is a title of one of his novels). Among hunters and horse lovers Surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. Dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and don't forget, his first book, SKETCHES BY BOZ, was also a funny book). So Dickens third book is OLIVER TWIST (which got pretty grim at points). Orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. Dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that. But Orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. Surtees, as I said, is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. But P.G.Wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer, poking fun at the upper reaches of the British social system. His Earl of Emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in England than being...well Earl of Emsworth! His Psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. His Stanley Uckridge will always have a \\"perfect\\" scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). And best of all, his Jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept Bertie Wooster, his boss. Since Wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. They served (and still serve) their purposes. In fact, compared Wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary Evelyn Waugh, who also wrote funny books, but of a more intellectual type. The best of Waugh remains among the high points of 20th Century British literature: BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, DECLINE AND FALL, and the rest. But in his determination to make his points, if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. For every VILE BODIES there was some failure late in his career like THE ORDEAL OF GILBERT PINFOLD. While Wodehouse could do lesser hack work too, his falling did not go as far as Waugh's did. Wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear \\"Bill\\" in the score of SHOWBOAT, it is not Kern and Hammerstein's tune, but Kern and Wodehouse's tune transposed from \\"Oh Lady, Lady\\" a dozen years earlier). He was a handy dramatist too. So it is pleasing to see that he took his novel A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS and turned it into the screenplay here. It has the normal Wodehouse touches. That perfect butler Keggs (Reginald Gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a \\"friendly\\" gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. He is also unable to refrain, occasionally, from singing Italian opera - despite Constance Collier's attempts to control his impulse. This is typical Wodehouse characterization. So is the way the love affair between Lady Alyce and Jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of Keggs and young Albert, both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. Wodehouse always does that type of plot switch, with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest. Wodehouse was also lucky here to have Burns and Allan to work with. It is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as SIX OF A KIND and WE'RE NOT DRESSING) George and Gracie did their best support with Fred Astaire. The Fun House sequence, which includes the song \\"Stiff Upper Lip\\", is wonderful, as is an earlier sequence where the three do a \\"whisk broom\\" dance (that Astaire learned from Burns). But Gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by Wodehouse in scenes with Gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only Albert happens to notice Keggs/Gardiner's mistake, and looks at Gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad). Her dialog with Lady Caroline (Collier)'s son Reggie (Ray Noble, the British band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her, but saying goodbye to Gracie as she drives off with George to get married is wonderful too. The film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of Ginger Rogers in it, and the weakness of Joan Fontaine. Fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role, but the flaw is really Wodehouse's - he didn't make the character very interesting. But the film can stand without that, given the other performers and their characters, Gershwin's music, and Wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun.","completion":"(B). positive"},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

Apply the latex in a shape that looks like a natural wound so it doesn’t appear fake on camera. Spread the latex thin enough over the surface so you can barely see the skin underneath it. You can buy liquid latex at costume stores or online. If you or someone on your film has a latex allergy, you can use white school glue instead though it may not hold as well. Lay a piece of toilet paper over the surface of the liquid latex. Press the toilet paper so it’s flat against the skin without any bubbles or deformation. Once the toilet paper is applied, carefully tear the edges of the toilet paper by hand so it matches the shape of the latex you applied. You can also use tissues if you don’t have any toilet paper. Dip your paintbrush back in the liquid latex and paint around the edges of the paper you applied so they don’t lift off of the skin. Then carefully paint over the surface of the toilet paper so the wound looks shiny and fresh. Let the latex dry completely, which should only take about 5-10 minutes. Use a hair dryer if you want to make the liquid latex dry faster. Once the latex is dry, use your fingernail or pin to tear through the center of the toilet paper. Pull the edges of the tear to the side to bunch the toilet paper up to make your wound look like it’s deep and sticking out of the skin. Keep working with the edges of the tear until you’re happy with the shape. Be careful not to accidentally stab the person you’re applying the wound to if you’re using a pin or sharp object to tear the paper. If you don’t know what you want your wound to look like, then look up images from other horror movies or actual wounds to get ideas for reference. Follow the mixing directions on a package of gelatin and stir it until it has a syrupy consistency. Use a brush or a butter knife to apply the gelatin in thick lumps around the fake wound. Stretch the gelatin and move it around randomly to shape it. The gelatin will quickly set and dry in place. Test the temperature of the gelatin on your hand before applying it since it could be hot when you mix it. When you’re applying wounds, crush up some oatmeal or corn flakes and attach them with liquid latex. Let the latex dry completely before painting over the oatmeal to make it look like a wound. The oatmeal or corn flakes will give the wound a bumpier texture and make it seem more realistic. Use a powder or cream foundation that matches the skin tone of your actor and apply it over the entire wound as a base coat. Make sure none of the toilet paper shows through the foundation or your wound will look fake. Blend the edges of the wound into the skin with a blending sponge so it looks realistic. A foundation airbrush will give your fake wound the smoothest application, but any applicator will work for painting your wound. Use a makeup brush to add in different shades of blue, brown, purple and black around the edges of your wound. Work from the lightest to the darkest colors so they’re easier to blend. Keep painting the wound until you’re satisfied with how it looks. You can buy makeup kits with color palettes meant for wounds from a costume shop or online. Look up pictures of the actual wound you’re trying to create so it looks authentic. Be aware that you may see some graphic images during your search. If you aren’t getting a close-up shot of the wound on camera, then you don’t need to spend time making a lot of details while you’re applying the makeup. Take some of the fake blood you’ve made and paint it on the inside of the wound so it looks it’s bleeding. Apply a thick layer of the blood on the inside of the wound so it appears wet and fresh on camera. Then, use a sponge to add some blood spatter around the outer edges of the wound so it seems like it’s dripping out. Test how the wound looks on camera to see if you need to apply more blood.

It's a day that comes only once every 100 years -- 11/11/11. And in Vegas, that means throngs of lovebirds are flocking to chapels to get hitched Friday. \\"We're surrounded by hundreds of couples who want to get married on 11/11/11,\\" said the Rev. Charlotte Richards, owner of Little White Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip. The chapel has 200 brides and grooms who are either getting hitched for the first time or are renewing their vows. In addition to a beautiful ceremony, Richards said she is offering bridal flowers and dog tags that have the 11/11/11 date inscribed on them. Many couples booked their special day two years in advance. At least 75 additional staff members were needed to accommodate the demand at Little White Wedding Chapel. \\"We have 17 ministers, limousine drivers, greeters, videographers,\\" Richards said. In 30 of the weddings, an Elvis impersonator will serenade the couple. Closer to downtown, the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel is equally abuzz. It has 190 weddings booked, with the first starting at midnight. That means about four weddings every 30 minutes throughout the day, with only a couple of hours of down time for a break. General Manager Brian Mills calls his establishment \\"The Fun Chapel.\\" Couples can have Blues Brothers or Marilyn Monroe impersonators as officiators.

Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What causes different shapes of the moon to appear?\\" and the following answer choices: - scattered light - Physical weathering - reflecting light - moon revolving around Earth - a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun - refract or absorb. - oxidation reaction - reflect objectstowards the eye Now knowing that the moon revolving around the Earth causes the phases of the moon and phases refer to the different shapes the moon appears from the earth, choose the best answer. The answer is:","completion":"Moon revolving around Earth. To provide a detailed explanation, the appearance of the Moon's different shapes, also known as lunar phases, is primarily caused by the Moon's revolution around the Earth. As the Moon orbits our planet, the portion of its surface illuminated by the Sun changes relative to our viewpoint on Earth. There are eight main lunar phases, and they occur in a continuous cycle approximately every 29.5 days, known as a lunar month. These phases are determined by the Moon's position in its orbit around the Earth, and the way the Sun's light reflects off the lunar surface. The main phases are: 1. New Moon: The Moon lies between the Earth and the Sun, with the dark side facing Earth. This phase is not visible as it receives no direct sunlight from our perspective. 2. Waxing Crescent: A thin, sliver of sunlight begins to illuminate the Moon's right side, as it moves away from the Sun in its orbit. 3. First Quarter: Half of the Moon's right side is illuminated, forming a shape that resembles a semicircle. 4. Waxing Gibbous: More than half of the Moon's right side is illuminated, and the illuminated portion continues to grow. 5. Full Moon: The Moon is on the opposite side of the Earth to the Sun. The entire visible side is illuminated, creating a bright, round shape in the night sky. 6. Waning Gibbous: The illumination of the Moon starts to decrease. More than half of its left side is illuminated, but less than during the Full Moon phase. 7. Third Quarter: Half of the Moon's left side is illuminated, forming a shape that looks like a mirror image of the First Quarter. 8. Waning Crescent: The illuminated portion of the Moon continues to shrink, leaving a thin crescent shape of light on the left side. In conclusion, the different shapes of the Moon that appear in the sky are caused by the Moon revolving around the Earth. The Sun's light reflects differently on the lunar surface depending on the Moon's position during its orbit. This phenomenon results in the lunar phases, which we observe from Earth as the Moon's various shapes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

There was no collusion. There was no obstruction,\\" he said. \\"The IG (inspector general) report yesterday went a long way to show that, and I think that the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited.” But the report in question only dealt with how the FBI handled the Clinton email controversy. It was critical of the man Trump fired as FBI director, James Comey, but rejected the notion of a politically-directed effort aimed at Trump. “This report did not find any evidence of political bias or improper considerations actually impacting the investigation under review,\\" announced current FBI Director Christopher Wray. Democrats also took note of the report. “Anyone who is hoping to use this report to undermine the Mueller probe or prove the existence of a ‘deep state’ conspiracy against President Trump will be sorely disappointed,\\" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. During his lengthy encounter with reporters Friday, Trump also defended his recent summit meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “They are doing so much for us, and now we are well on our way to get denuclearization,\\" he said. \\"And the agreement says there will be total denuclearization.

Answer the following question: Information: - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament. - The International Pentecostal Holiness Church ( IPHC ) or simply Pentecostal Holiness Church ( PHC ) is a Pentecostal Christian denomination founded in 1911 with the merger of two older denominations . Historically centered in the Southeastern United States , particularly the Carolinas and Georgia , the Pentecostal Holiness Church now has an international presence . In 2000 , the church reported a worldwide membership of over one million -- over three million including affiliates . Heavily influenced by two major American revival movements -- the holiness movement of the late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century -- the church 's theological roots derive from John Wesley 's teachings on sanctification . Several ministers who were raised in the Pentecostal Holiness Church have come to have greater name recognition than the church itself , such as Oral Roberts , an internationally known charismatic evangelist ; Charles Stanley , a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention ; and C.M. Ward , a former Assemblies of God radio preacher . - Apostolic succession is the method whereby the ministry of the Christian Church is held to be derived from the apostles by a continuous succession, which has usually been associated with a claim that the succession is through a series of bishops. This series was seen originally as that of the bishops of a particular see founded by one or more of the apostles. According to historian Justo L. González, apostolic succession is generally understood today as meaning a series of bishops, regardless of see, each consecrated by other bishops, themselves consecrated similarly in a succession going back to the apostles. But, according to documentation produced by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, the sees (\\"cathedrae\\") play \\"an important role in inserting the bishop into the heart of ecclesial apostolicity\\". - A Christian denomination is a distinct religious body within Christianity, identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Individual bodies, however, may use alternative terms to describe themselves, such as church or sometimes fellowship. Divisions between one group and another are defined by authority and doctrine; issues such as the nature of Jesus, the authority of apostolic succession, eschatology, and papal primacy may separate one denomination from another. Groups of denominations often sharing broadly similar beliefs, practices, and historical ties are sometimes known as \\"branches of Christianity\\" or \\"denominational families\\". - Jesus (; c. 4 BC c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.

Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select from: +Yes; +No; If I tell you that Mammals breathe by relaxing the lungs, and ask you the question \\"what breathes by relaxing the lungs?\\", is the correct answer \\"mammals\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the correct answer is \\"mammals.\\" To provide a more detailed and long explanation, let us first understand the process of breathing in mammals. Respiration in mammals, including humans, is a vital process to deliver oxygen to cells and tissues while removing waste products such as carbon dioxide. The respiratory system in mammals involves multiple organs and structures, including the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and lungs. Breathing is a two-step process encompassing inspiration (inhaling) and expiration (exhaling). The diaphragm, a large, dome-shaped muscle beneath the lungs, plays a significant role in the breathing process, working in concert with the external and internal intercostal muscles that are present between the ribs. During inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and flattens, thereby increasing the thoracic cavity's volume and creating a pressure gradient that draws the air into the lungs. At the same time, the external intercostal muscles contract, raising the ribs and further expanding the thoracic cavity. As a result, the lungs expand, allowing oxygen to enter the alveolar sacs, where the gas exchange process takes place. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the tiny capillaries surrounding the alveoli while carbon dioxide diffuses from the capillaries into the alveoli, ready to be exhaled. Expiration, on the other hand, is a passive process driven primarily by the elastic recoil of the lungs and the relaxation of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles. Once these muscles relax, the diaphragm resumes its original dome-shaped position, and the ribs lower, reducing the thoracic cavity's volume. This decrease in volume causes the pressure inside the lungs to rise slightly above the atmospheric pressure, and the carbon dioxide-laden air is expelled from the lungs. Thus, mammals breathe by expanding and relaxing their lungs, allowing this vital gas exchange to take place continuously and effectively. The statement \\"Mammals breathe by relaxing the lungs\\" refers to the expiration process in which the lungs return to their resting state after the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles relax. Consequently, the correct and more complete answer to the question \\"what breathes by relaxing the lungs?\\" would be \\"mammals,\\" particularly during the expiration phase of the breathing process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: The other one is my closest friend in college, who has been there with me through the last four tough years. Hypothesis: That guy sucked and was never there for me during the toughest years of college. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise given. Entailment in logic and reasoning means that from a certain premise, we can deduce or conclude another statement because the latter follows necessarily or logically from the former. In other words, if the premise is true, then the entailed hypothesis must also be true. In order to assess whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to examine both statements in detail. Premise: The other one is my closest friend in college, who has been there with me through the last four tough years. The premise establishes the following information: 1. The subject (the other one) is the speaker's closest friend in college. 2. This friend has been with the speaker throughout their college journey, particularly during the last four tough years. Based on this premise, we are led to believe that the speaker has a strong bond with the subject and that they have had each other's support during difficult times in college. Hypothesis: That guy sucked and was never there for me during the toughest years of college. The hypothesis states: 1. The subject (that guy) was not a good friend, implied by the statement \\"sucked.\\" 2. The subject was never present or supportive during the speaker's difficult years in college. The hypothesis contradicts the premise by asserting that the subject was never there for the speaker during their toughest years of college and was not a good friend in general. Since the hypothesis contradicts and does not logically follow from the premise, it is not entailed by it. The premise presents the subject as a supportive, close friend who has been there for the speaker through trying experiences. In contrast, the hypothesis suggests that the subject was not supportive, implying a lot of negative assumptions about their relationship. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be considered a logical consequence of the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

While my other computer-owning peers would sit for hours while their tape drives squawked away loading 'Manic Miner' or 'Bubble Buster' I was more fascinated by learning to write my own programs. The first of these consisted of just two lines of code* that made the word 'shit' appear again and again on my screen, to the huge amusement of my friends and the irritation of my parents, who obviously had more educational motives for bringing a computer into the house. From that day on, the possibilities offered by technology to both subvert the norm and get attention had me hooked.

The Emperor Diocletian (r. 284–305) split the empire into separately administered eastern and western halves in 286; the empire was not considered divided by its inhabitants or rulers, as legal and administrative promulgations in one division were considered valid in the other.[C] In 330, after a period of civil war, Constantine the Great (r. 306–337) refounded the city of Byzantium as the newly renamed eastern capital, Constantinople. Diocletian's reforms strengthened the governmental bureaucracy, reformed taxation, and strengthened the army, which bought the empire time but did not resolve the problems it was facing: excessive taxation, a declining birthrate, and pressures on its frontiers, among others. Civil war between rival emperors became common in the middle of the 4th century, diverting soldiers from the empire's frontier forces and allowing invaders to encroach. For much of the 4th century, Roman society stabilised in a new form that differed from the earlier classical period, with a widening gulf between the rich and poor, and a decline in the vitality of the smaller towns.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Hers - A CHILD HAS HER FIRST BRUSH WITH 'CRIME' - NYTimes.com ICOMMITTED my first white-collar crime in second grade. Like many white-collar criminals, I persist in believing that I acted for an honorable cause and that the lessons crime taught me were not necessarily the ones society would have me learn. Things began innocently enough. A priest bearing a stack of magazines and some charts came to every classroom in the school. ''Mission magazines,'' he explained. In their pulp pages nurse-nuns battled fierce bacteria in steaming jungles and brave priests struggled to persuade cannibals to look for new sources of protein. This was edge-of-the-seat stuff in our far-north Michigan town, which was so small and isolated that coins never showed up until the year after the dates on their faces. The charts that came with the magazines were for fund raising. They had thermometers printed on them, like the United Way thermometers that sprout every year on courthouse lawns. At the top was a goal of 5, and the thermometer's ''degrees'' were marked in nickels. ''Pagan babies,'' the priest told us. Each 5 would buy one pagan baby. The money would feed the baby and, more important, would guarantee that the baby would be baptized and thereby rescued from spending eternity in limbo. Because our second grade was such a special class, the priest said, he brought two thermometers. He could tell we were sacrificing and persevering enough to save two pagan babies. He suggested we make a contest of it; the boys could race the girls to 5. The impropriety of buying babies never occurred to me, nor did I grasp the ethnocentric hauteur of a concept like ''pagan'' babies. I just wanted to help. I was unnerved by the magazine pictures of children swollen with hunger - I who never felt like cleaning my plate. The boys-against-girls contest appealed to my sense of urgency in the matter. And, I admit, to my basest competitive instincts. My first thought was that the girls slightly outnumbered the boys. If we worked fast we could win. But when the priest asked who would make the first contribution, I began to see what we were up against. Pockets, for one thing. Little boys have four pockets in their pants and two in their shirts, and one thing they carry in them is money. (None of the girls would have purses until spring, when we made our first communion and needed them for regulation religious equipment like rosaries.) Not one girl had money. Mrs. Davey, our teacher, colored the first red degrees on the boys' thermometer. Undaunted, I went home for lunch and told my mother about the pagan babies. She said I could take a nickel. I supposed that every girl was home doing the same and our thermometer would soar past the boys'. For lunch we'd had egg-salad sandwiches -one of the few things I liked - and it pleased me to think the pagan babies would soon be having egg salad, too. I ran back to school and forced my nickel upon Mrs. Davey. She announced that everyone who had brought money for pagan babies should go stand by the thermometers. To my amazement almost no one went. It was a big class, a postwar bumper crop of 60, but there were only five of us at the thermometers. Didn't the rest of them care? Didn't they know that the bloated stomachs and inside-out navels in those horrible photographs belonged to real children? Worst of all, only one other girl gave money. From the back of the room the thermometers burned into me all afternoon: 48 cents boys, 10 cents girls. During recess I did some lobbying. The pagan babies would die without our money for food, I pointed out, and because they hadn't been baptized they couldn't go to heaven. It would be our fault. But nobody believed it. Africa and Asia seemed unimaginably far away, starvation even farther. At home I told my mother what had happened and asked if I could take a dollar. She said another nickel. When I accused her of being just one more person who didn't care about pagan babies, she said the fund raising was a class project and the whole class should chip in. Contributions dribbled in for the next few days. Finally, after Mrs. Davey plugged the enterprise, the girls went into action. One day we even took the lead - 3.42 girls, 3.39 boys. Here was the glorious proof of what I'd known all along: girls could beat boys. Then Robert stepped forward with 50 cents. This was the greatest philanthropy we'd seen, and someone asked where he'd gotten the money. His paper route, he said. My pride blew away like a dead leaf in a cold wind.After school I told my mother I needed a paper route. She said paper boys were like altar boys -they were always boys. It wasn't fair, she agreed, but she doubted that we could change the world before the pagan baby campaign ended. If only my father were home. He wouldn't let me be beaten by Robert's paper route. But he worked on a ship on the Great Lakes and would be away for days. Besides, it seemed demeaning to ask for money now that I knew Robert earned his. Imagine having money to spend however you wanted, with no need to account to anyone! I racked my brain to think how I might acquire the same freedom, but because the pagan babies needed help fast, all my thoughts came back to a single possibility: crime. Stealing was a sin, of course, but how could it be wrong to steal for pagan babies? That night while my mother gave my little sister a bath I took 40 cents from her wallet. To avoid suspicion at school, I gave half in the morning, half in the afternoon. Mrs. Davey didn't ask any questions. The most interesting thing about crime was that it was so easy. Over the weekend everybody seemed to forget about pagan babies, and in the days that followed contributions tapered off to almost nothing. I kept bringing nickels, quietly, in the hope that Robert wouldn't notice that the girls were catching up. But he did. He loved playing the last tycoon, waiting until everyone else had given money, then fishing in his pockets and counting out just what was needed to put the boys ahead. I stole only once more for the pagan babies. I gave it up not out of guilt or fear but because I sensed that Robert would always come up with more than I could steal. And once I understood the impossibility of winning, I wanted to lose as invisibly as possible. I didn't want Robert to have the faintest idea the contest mattered to me. After the boys won, I tuned out. I don't know how long it took the girls to finish buying their pagan baby. I was preoccupied with dreams of the day when I would be big enough to rake leaves or babysit so I would never again know the humiliations suffered by women of dependent means.","completion":"The article narrates the author's experience of participating in a fundraising contest as a child, titled \\"Pagan Babies,\\" in which their second-grade class raised money to save and baptize children in need. The priest visiting their school provided charts with thermometers indicating the progress towards the 5 goal for each child, and the class was split into boys and girls to compete against each other.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Scotland, meanwhile had remained an independent Kingdom. In 1603, that changed when the King of Scotland inherited the Crown of England, and consequently the Crown of Ireland also. The subsequent 17th century was one of political upheaval, religious division and war. English colonialism in Ireland of the 16th century was extended by large-scale Scottish and English colonies in Ulster. Religious division heightened and the King in England came into conflict with parliament. A prime issue was, inter alia, over his policy of tolerance towards Catholicism. The resulting English Civil War or War of the Three Kingdoms led to a revolutionary republic in England. Ireland, largely Catholic was mainly loyal to the king. Following defeat to the parliaments army, large scale land distributions from loyalist Irish nobility to English commoners in the service of the parliamentary army created the beginnings a new Ascendancy class which over the next hundred years would obliterate the English (Hiberno-Norman) and Gaelic Irish nobility in Ireland. The new ruling class was Protestant and British, whilst the common people were largely Catholic and Irish. This theme would influence Irish politics for centuries to come. When the monarchy was restored in England, the king found it politically impossible to restore all the lands of former land-owners in Ireland. The \\"Glorious Revolution\\" of 1688 repeated similar themes: a Catholic king pushing for religious tolerance in opposition to a Protestant parliament in England. The king's army was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne and at the militarily crucial Battle of Aughrim in Ireland. Resistance held out, and a guarantee of religious tolerance was a cornerstone of the Treaty of Limerick. However, in the evolving political climate, the terms of Limerick were superseded, a new monarchy was installed, and the new Irish parliament was packed with the new elite which legislated increasing intolerant Penal Laws, which discommoded both Dissenters and Catholics. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Why did the King of England have issues with parliment in the 17th century?","completion":"Okay little buddy, let me explain it to you. In the 17th century, there was a King of England who had some disagreements with a group called the Parliament. The Parliament is like a big team of people who help to make decisions for the country. One of the main reasons the King and the Parliament had issues was because of different beliefs about religion. The King wanted to be more accepting of a religion called Catholicism, but the Parliament had many people who were Protestants and they didn't want to be too friendly with Catholics. Because they couldn't agree on this subject, it led to lots of arguments and eventually a big fight called the English Civil War. It's like when you have a disagreement with your friends and sometimes it's hard to find a solution that makes everyone happy.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who joins Black Flag? is inside the article: The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar.

Options: - sweating - having fun - smiling - increased heart rate - anger Explain why a human would choose \\"sweating\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sweating An uncomfortable consequence of jumping rope is indeed sweating. Although it might not be the first thing that comes to mind when people think of discomfort while jumping rope, the discomfort caused by sweating cannot be overlooked. In the given options, \\"having fun,\\" \\"smiling,\\" and \\"anger\\" are feelings or emotions that don't necessarily cause physical discomfort during the activity of jumping rope. However, \\"increased heart rate\\" might be uncomfortable for some, but it is a normal physiological response to increased activity, and it is actually beneficial to boost cardiovascular health. Let's delve deeper into why a human would choose \\"sweating\\" as the answer to the question above: 1. Excessive sweating: When a person engages in physical activities like jumping rope, their body generates heat, and to maintain a normal temperature, the body starts to sweat. Excessive sweating can make a person feel uncomfortable, as the clothes they are wearing gradually become wet and heavy and stick to their skin. The increased dampness might lead to chafing and irritation, especially in sensitive areas. 2. Odor: Sweat itself is odorless, but the presence of moisture on warmer areas of the body, like the armpits, groin, and feet, creates a perfect environment for bacteria to thrive. Bacterial breakdown of sweat, oils, and dead skin cells may produce an unpleasant smell, making the person self-conscious and uncomfortable around others. 3. Skin irritation: As mentioned earlier, sweating can lead to chafing, irritation, and in some cases pruritus, commonly known as itchiness, due to dampness and the friction between skin and clothes or shoes. This can result in redness, inflammation, and discomfort, which might not be easily ignored by a person during physical activities. 4. Slippery hands: Sweating can also cause the palms of the hands to become damp or moist, which may result in a reduced grip on the rope. This can pose a challenge while trying to maintain a consistent jump rope rhythm and might affect a person's performance, leading to frustration and discomfort. 5. Increased perspiration: Some people naturally tend to perspire more than others, and jumping rope only increases the amount of sweating they experience. So, individuals who sweat profusely might prefer low-intensity activities and might consider the amount of sweating they experience while jumping rope to be uncomfortable. In conclusion, although jumping rope is a fun and excellent cardiovascular workout, it can also lead to some uncomfortable consequences like sweating. A human would choose \\"sweating\\" as the answer to the question because it causes physical discomfort like skin irritation, sweaty clothes, and possible odor, which can make the entire experience of jumping rope less enjoyable and more uncomfortable. Additionally, these consequences can contribute to the negative feelings of self-consciousness and may affect a person's confidence while exercising."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: I love charity shops and so do lots of other people in Britain because you find quite a few of them on every high street. The charity shop is a British institution, selling everything from clothes to electric goods, all at very good prices. You can get things you won't find in the shops anymore. The thing I like best about them is that your money is going to a good cause and not into the pockets of profit-driven companies, and you are not damaging the planet, but finding a new home for unwanted goods. The first charity shop was opened in 1947 by Oxfam. The famous charity's appeal to aid postwar Greece had been so successful that it had been flooded with donations. They decided to set up a shop to sell some of these donations to raise money for that appeal. Now there are over 7,000 charity shops in the UK. My favorite charity shop in my hometown is the Red Cross shop, where I always find children's books, all 10 or 20 pence each. Most of the people working in the charity shops are volunteers, although there is often a manager who gets paid. Over 90% of the goods in the charity shops are donated by the public. Every morning you see bags of unwanted items outside the front of shops, although they don't encourage this, rather ask people to bring things in when the shop is open. The shops have very low running costs, and all profits go to charity work. Charity shops raise more than PS110 million a year, funding medical research, overseas aid, supporting sick and poor children, homeless and disabled people, and much more.

Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing. and a hint : About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. Please answer this question : Which mountain has a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information and hint, the White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks compared to Dome mountains. This is because the White mountains are characterized by the presence of caves, stalactites, stalagmites, and karst phenomena, which are primarily formed in limestone regions. As stated in the hint, about 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones, and the solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, where water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Since most cave systems are formed through limestone bedrock, it is evident that the White mountains would have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks in their composition. On the other hand, Dome mountains are described as being very massive, of volcanic origin, and excellent for climbing. The volcanic origin of Dome mountains points towards a predominantly igneous rock composition rather than sedimentary rocks. While it is possible that some sedimentary rocks may be present in certain Dome mountains, the overall percentage of sedimentary rocks in these mountains would be significantly less compared to the White mountains. In conclusion, the White mountains have a higher percentage of sedimentary rocks in their composition due to factors such as the presence of cave systems, karst landscapes, and the fact that they are primarily formed in limestone regions.

Write a title for this article: A futuristic weapon originally designed for use by NASA and the US Navy is now a frightening, trimmed down portable unit able to wreak terrifying damage on the battlefield. General Atomics, the company behind the Rail Gun, which fires projectiles that travel six times faster than a speeding bullet, unveiled the latest truck-mounted cannon over the weekend, Next Big Future reports. Five test projectiles were successfully fired at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, with high spec camera kit tracking missiles moving at a velocity of 9600 km/h. A standard artillery shell flies through the air at 3200 km/h, which easily eclipses the speed of sound (1235 km/h) and makes the iconic Tomahawk missile (885 km/h) look like an antiquated tortoise. The rail gun is essentially an electric circuit, with its main components being a pair of parallel rails and a power supply. A current flows through one rail and back through the other, which generates a magnetic field. This ultimately triggers an electromagnetic force that launches the projectile at such ground-breaking speeds. The US navy unveiled the Rail Gun almost two years ago.","completion":"Title: \\"Revolutionizing Modern Warfare: General Atomics Unveils Portable Rail Gun Capable of Firing Projectiles at Unprecedented Speeds\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, it can be inferred that the movie was seen positively. The reviewer's choice of words indicates a positive perception towards the acting and the prominence of the role in the movie. Firstly, the reviewer mentions that the actress is \\"accomplished,\\" which suggests that she is skilled and has a history of successful performances. This not only highlights her professional achievements but also establishes her credibility in the context of the movie. In addition, the reviewer describes the role as \\"big\\" and \\"juicy,\\" which are positive adjectives that signify that the role is significant, rich, and offers ample opportunities to showcase the actress's talents. A big, juicy role usually indicates that the character has depth and complexity, which tends to be a desirable feature in movies, allowing the actor or actress to express their artistry better. Although the sentence provided does not present a complete review or assessment of the entire movie, the positive outlook on the actress's performance and the importance of her role suggest that, at least in terms of acting, the movie was well-received. It is, however, important to acknowledge that a comprehensive review would likely consider other aspects of the movie, such as plot, cinematography, and direction, among others. In conclusion, based on the preceding review sentence, the movie was seen positively, primarily due to the accomplished actress's performance in a big, juicy role. The reviewer's admiration for both the actress's capabilities and the character's prominence within the movie contributes to the overall positive impression of the film."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},Y={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],D={key:0},R={key:1};function N(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",Y,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
