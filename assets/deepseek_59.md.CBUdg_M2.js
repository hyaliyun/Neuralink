Background: Elizabeth Kocianski was born in Elmira, New York and raised by Polish parents. When she was eleven years old, she won a coloring contest with a prize of tickets to a television taping for the World Wrestling Federation. Kocianski credits this as when she fell in love with professional wrestling. She cites Bret Hart, Owen Hart, and Ted DiBiase as her favorite wrestlers. Context: After a brief hiatus, Phoenix returned on the July 27 episode of Raw, teaming with Alicia Fox and Rosa Mendes in a losing effort to Mickie James, Gail Kim, and Kelly Kelly. Phoenix had her first opportunity for the WWE Divas Championship, being narrowly defeated by the defending champion, Mickie James, on the August 31 episode of Raw, after winning a number one contender's battle royal that same night. On the October 12 episode of Raw, it was announced that Phoenix had been traded to the SmackDown brand. Phoenix made her in-ring debut for the brand on the October 30 episode of SmackDown, defeating Jenny Brooks, an \\"enhancement talent\\". In January 2010, at the Royal Rumble, she entered the Royal Rumble match and eliminated The Great Khali, before she was eliminated by CM Punk. With her entry, she became the second woman in history to enter the Royal Rumble match, the first being Chyna. After being told by Vickie Guerrero, the SmackDown consultant, that she would not be receiving a Women's Championship opportunity, Phoenix turned face after she saved Tiffany from an attack by Guerrero and LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla) on the March 12 episode of SmackDown. She then went on to defeat McCool and Layla in a tag team match involving Tiffany. The feud with McCool continued at WrestleMania XXVI, where they were on opposing teams in a 10-Diva tag team match, which Phoenix's team lost, although they won a rematch the following night on Raw. On the April 23 episode of Smackdown, Phoenix teamed with Mickie James to face McCool and Layla. After the match, LayCool beat down Phoenix and smeared make-up on her face and body while she was unconscious. This resulted in Phoenix receiving a match for the Women's Championship against McCool at Extreme Rules, where she defeated McCool in an \\"Extreme Makeover\\" match to win her third Women's Championship. On the May 6 episode of Superstars, Phoenix tore her ACL in a match against Rosa Mendes, and as a result, one week later on SmackDown, McCool invoked her rematch clause to face Phoenix in a two-on-one handicap match along with Layla, where Layla pinned Phoenix to become the new Women's Champion. Phoenix returned from her injury at November's Survivor Series pay-per-view, and attacked the former co-Champions Michelle McCool and Layla, after they lost the WWE Divas Championship to Natalya. Phoenix and Natalya then formed an alliance, and at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs in December, Phoenix and Natalya defeated LayCool in the first Divas Tag Team Tables match in WWE history. Question: how did the feud resolve? Answer:","completion":"The feud between Beth Phoenix and LayCool (Michelle McCool and Layla) resolved at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs event in December. Beth Phoenix teamed up with Natalya to face LayCool in the first-ever Divas Tag Team Tables match in WWE history. Phoenix and Natalya emerged victorious in the match, thus putting an end to the feud."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the right answer to the question \\"changes in what are essential for evolution to occur\\" is indeed \\"genetic material.\\" Evolution is driven by changes at the genetic level. Traits of organisms are determined by their genetic material, their DNA. Over time, the structures of species' DNA change, driven by a mix of random mutation, natural selection (the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population due to their effects on the survival or reproduction of their bearers), gene flow (transfer of genetic material from one population to another), and genetic drift (random changes in the frequency of certain traits in a gene pool). Small mutations accumulate over many generations, and together with other factors like gene flow and genetic drift, lead to evolution, which results in new species or sub-species. These processes can lead to new characteristics appearing and existing ones changing or disappearing. It can lead to species being better adapted to their environment, or to new environments, and it's how the diversity of life on earth has come about. In conclusion, changes to the genetic material are not only important, but are in fact essential for evolution to occur.

What is the title of this article: Depending on which component of sexual orientation is being assessed and referenced, different conclusions can be drawn about the prevalence rate of homosexuality which has real world consequences. Knowing how much of the population is made up of homosexual individuals influences how this population may be seen or treated by the public and government bodies. For example, if homosexual individuals constitute only 1% of the general population they are politically easier to ignore or than if they are known to be a constituency that surpasses most ethnic and ad minority groups. If the number is relatively minor then it is difficult to argue for community based same sex programs and services, mass media inclusion of gay role models, or Gay/Straight Alliances in schools. For this reason, in the 1970s Bruce Voeller, the chair of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force perpetuated a common myth that the prevalence of homosexuality is 10% for the whole population by averaging a 13% number for men and a 7% number for women. Voeller generalized this finding and used it as part of the modern gay rights movement to convince politicians and the public that \\"we [gays and lesbians] are everywhere\\".

A:","completion":"If the New Madrid Fault experienced an earthquake, several consequences could occur, depending on the magnitude and location of the event. Some potential impacts include: 1. Ground shaking: People in the affected areas would feel the ground shaking, with stronger shaking closer to the epicenter. The level of shaking would determine the extent of possible damage to infrastructure, buildings, and homes. 2. Damage to infrastructure and buildings: Infrastructure such as bridges, roads, railways, pipelines, and utilities may sustain damage, depending on the earthquake's magnitude and the design standards of the structures. Buildings, especially older structures, could suffer severe damage or collapse. 3. Injuries and fatalities: Depending on the degree of the tremor and the location of the population, there could be injuries and fatalities among individuals caught in collapsing buildings, falling debris, and other hazards. 4. Aftershocks: Aftershocks, or smaller earthquakes, following the main event could continue for weeks, months, or even years, causing additional damage, disruption, and public anxiety. 5. Liquefaction: In areas where the soil is saturated with water, the shaking from the earthquake could cause the ground to lose strength, behaving more like a liquid. This phenomenon, known as liquefaction, can lead to additional damage and the collapse of buildings. 6. Landslides: The earthquake may trigger landslides in areas with steep slopes, affecting communities in their path and causing additional damage. 7. Economic impact: The quake could have a significant economic impact on the region, as businesses may be forced to close, and the cost of repairs and recovery could be substantial. Additionally, insurance premiums and property values in the affected areas might be affected. 8. Emergency response: Local, state, and federal agencies would need to coordinate their response efforts, providing aid and relief to those affected by the earthquake. This could strain resources and personnel, especially if other natural disasters are occurring simultaneously. Overall, the exact consequences of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault would depend on various factors such as the magnitude, location, depth, time of day, and preparedness levels of nearby communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ion gauges are used in ultrahigh vacuum. They come in two types: hot cathode and cold cathode. In the hot cathode version an electrically heated filament produces an electron beam. The electrons travel through the gauge and ionize gas molecules around them. The resulting ions are collected at a negative electrode. The current depends on the number of ions, which depends on the pressure in the gauge. Hot cathode gauges are accurate from 10−3 torr to 10−10 torr. The principle behind cold cathode version is the same, except that electrons are produced in a discharge created by a high voltage electrical discharge. Cold cathode gauges are accurate from 10−2 torr to 10−9 torr. Ionization gauge calibration is very sensitive to construction geometry, chemical composition of gases being measured, corrosion and surface deposits. Their calibration can be invalidated by activation at atmospheric pressure or low vacuum. The composition of gases at high vacuums will usually be unpredictable, so a mass spectrometer must be used in conjunction with the ionization gauge for accurate measurement.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation.

Fact: food is a source of energy for animals Question: food is a source of energy for what? What's the answer?","completion":"Food is a source of energy for animals, including humans. It provides the essential nutrients and energy required for their growth, development, and daily activities. Consuming food enables animals to carry out vital bodily functions such as movement, reproduction, and maintaining their overall health. Food contains energy-providing macronutrients, including carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. These macronutrients get broken down during the process of digestion, which takes place within an animal's gastrointestinal tract. They are then absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to various cells and tissues, where they serve to fuel cellular metabolism and the synthesis of new molecules required for the body's maintenance and repair. Carbohydrates are the body's primary source of energy. These compounds are composed of simple sugars like glucose, which can quickly be converted to energy, and more complex molecules like starch and cellulose, which require more extended periods of breakdown. When consumed, carbohydrates are transformed into glucose, which can either be used immediately or stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles to be utilized at a later time when energy requirements increase. Fats are another significant source of energy. They contain more than twice the calories per gram compared to carbohydrates and proteins. Fats are stored in adipose tissues and can be mobilized for use when energy demands are high or when carbohydrate stores have been depleted. They also serve important functions in cushioning and insulating vital organs, cell membrane structure, and hormone production. Proteins, in addition to their role as a source of energy, are primarily responsible for the growth and repair of tissues. Proteins are composed of amino acids that are used for building various structures within the cell, such as enzymes, hormones, and structural components. During periods of energy deficiency, proteins can be broken down into their constituent amino acids, and these can be converted into glucose or other energy-rich molecules for use as energy. Vitamins and minerals are essential micronutrients that support various metabolic processes, immune system function, and maintain the body's overall homeostasis. While they do not directly supply energy, their presence is crucial for the efficient extraction and utilization of energy from food. In conclusion, food is a significant source of energy for animals, which is derived from the macronutrients present in various food sources. Energy obtained from food is vital for growth, development, and maintaining daily activities, as well as supporting various physiological processes that help to ensure an animal's survival and good health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That's because","completion":"Ian and Neil have distinct preferences and experiences that shape their individual feelings toward the sport of volleyball. There are numerous factors that can contribute to their divergent opinions. Firstly, physical abilities and natural athletic talents can significantly impact one's enjoyment of a sport. Ian may possess inherent skills, such as agility, coordination, and speed, which allow him to thrive in the fast-paced environment of volleyball. On the other hand, Neil might lack these qualities or excel in different areas that don't align with the demands of the sport. This fundamental disparity in aptitudes inevitably causes Ian to enjoy playing volleyball, while Neil doesn't appreciate it. Secondly, personal experiences with sports can create strong emotional connections or aversions to them. Perhaps Ian had positive experiences with volleyball from a young age; maybe he made close friends through the sport, achieved success on a team, or bonded with a mentor or coach. These experiences would foster a deep love for volleyball. Conversely, Neil might have encountered negative experiences, such as injuries, performance pressure, or feeling excluded from a team, leading him to harbor resentment toward the sport. Another factor to consider is cultural and societal influences. Some regions may hold specific sports in high regard, while others might not place as much importance on them or appreciate different activities altogether. Ian could have been influenced by a volleyball-loving community, subsequently developing an affinity for the sport. Meanwhile, Neil might have been surrounded by individuals who appreciate different sports, like soccer or basketball, causing him to gravitate towards those instead. Personality traits also play a role in shaping one's interests. Ian's competitive nature, teamwork skills, and enjoyment of physical challenges could make volleyball a perfect fit for his temperament. However, Neil's personality may be better suited for individual sports or activities that require different skills. For example, he might enjoy long distance running, where personal endurance and mental strength are key factors. Lastly, personal motivations can impact how much someone values a sport. Ian may relish the challenge and excitement of volleyball, setting ambitious goals for himself and pushing his limits in pursuit of improvement. Neil, on the other hand, may prioritize other aspects of life, such as academic success, personal relationships, or other hobbies, leading him to dislike volleyball due to its perceived lack of importance in his life. In conclusion, several factors contribute to Ian enjoying playing volleyball while Neil hates it. Their physical abilities, personal experiences, cultural and societal influences, personality traits, and individual motivations all play a significant role in forming their opinions of the sport. As a result, these factors culminate in their contrasting feelings towards volleyball, showcasing the complex nature of personal preferences and interests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Question: How old was Proctor when Moss Jr. became his student at United Tehological Seminary? Passage:Moss was born in and raised in LaGrange, Georgia, the fourth of five children. After being orphaned at 16 he earned his B.A. at Morehouse College in 1956, before earning his Master of Divinity from the Morehouse School of Religion in 1959. At Morehouse Moss was taught and mentored by Benjamin Mays, who was also a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr. While at Morehouse Moss helped lead sit-ins and other activities to protest segregation. He completed further graduate coursework at the Interdenominational Theological Center from 1960 to 1961. He also earned a Doctor of Ministry from United Theological Seminary in 1990, where he was taught by Samuel DeWitt Proctor and became friends with Jeremiah Wright, pastor of the famous Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago and pastor of Barack Obama. Moss's son, Otis Moss III, would later take over as senior pastor for Wright after he was caught up in a controversy during the 2008 presidential election over the content of sermons he gave during the time in which Barack Obama attended the church.

Goal: stove top Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To determine the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of getting a stove top, we must first analyze the different methods available: 1. Purchasing a new stove top: One option to get a stove top is to buy a new one from a store or an online retailer. This method ensures that you get a brand-new, functional, and often warrantied stove top. You can choose the exact model, color, and features you want. Pros: a) Quality: You get a high-quality and brand-new stove top meeting your requirements. b) Warranty: Most new stove tops come with a warranty, which offers security and peace of mind. c) Variety: You have a range of choices in terms of design, brand, and features. Cons: a) Expense: Purchasing a new stove top can be expensive, especially if you're looking for high-end models. b) Installation: You may need to hire a professional to install the stove top, which can add to the cost. 2. Used stove top: Another option would be to get a used stove top from a second-hand store, online classified ads, or garage sales. This can be more affordable but comes with some risks. Pros: a) Affordability: Used stove tops are usually cheaper than new ones, making them an attractive choice for those on a budget. b) Environmental impact: Buying a used stove top can help reduce waste, as you're giving a second life to an existing appliance. Cons: a) Quality: The used stove top may not be in the best condition and might require repairs or replacement sooner than a new one. b) Lack of warranty: Most used stove tops won't come with a warranty, and you'll be responsible for any repairs or issues that might arise. c) Limited choice: When buying a used stove top, you may have limited options in terms of design and features. 3. Repairing an existing stove top: If you already have a stove top that just needs repairs, you could consider fixing it up. Pros: a) Cost-effective: Repairing a stove top can be a more cost-effective option than buying a new one. b) Familiarity: Fixing up your existing stove top means keeping the same appliance you're already familiar with. Cons: a) Time-consuming: Repairing a stove top could take time to find the right parts and service. b) Uncertain results: Repairs may not be enough to fix the issue, which may lead to future breakdowns. Overall, the most reasonable method for acquiring a stove top depends on your specific situation. If you desire a high-quality, brand-new appliance and are willing to invest in it, purchasing a new stove top is the most logical choice. However, if you're on a budget and are willing to take on the risks associated with a used stove top, it could be a viable option. If you already have a stove top that just needs repairs, consider assessing the costs of repairing it versus buying a new or used stove top, and decide accordingly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The historical documentary, Mr. Deng Goes to Washington, which was first shown in the capital on May 12, not only reveals the details of an attempted assassination of Deng, but is also the first time that animated images of China's leaders have appeared on the silver screen. The film tells the story of Deng's nine-day visit to the US in 1979, only a month after China established diplomatic relations with the US for the first time after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Lv Muzi, the film's producer, said the film includes 12 animated sequences of Deng, drawn in French, American and Japanese styles, as well as China's traditional shadow puppetry style. Hu Yuchen, who has drawn cartoons for leaders including former premier, Wen Jiabao, is the artist behind the animated images of Deng.

District attorney expresses hope that others will come forward. Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Justice Served: Weberman Found Guilty on 59 Counts, Faces 117 Years in Prison for Child Abuse\\" Introduction In a landmark case that has captured the nation's attention, justice has been firmly and resoundingly served as Weberman was found guilty of all 59 counts of child abuse. With the potential sentence looming at 117 years in prison, this verdict sends a strong message that such horrendous acts against children will not be tolerated. The District Attorney has expressed hope that this case will inspire other survivors of abuse to come forward and bravely seek the justice they deserve. The Abuse and Its Consequences The unsuspecting victim in this appalling case was a young girl, only 12 years old when the abusive acts by Weberman began. Made to suffer through the most cruel and unimaginable forms of abuse, her testimony during the trial was harrowing, heartbreaking, and, ultimately, essential to ensuring Weberman was held accountable for his crimes. This brave girl's experiences will no doubt have a lifelong, and potentially devastating, impact on her well-being. Cases like hers underscore the urgency with which society must address and confront child abuse and provide survivors with the support, care, and justice they rightfully deserve. Weberman Found Guilty on All 59 Counts The trial was a painstaking process, as the prosecution carefully and methodically presented evidence that painted a dark and damning portrait of Weberman. From expert testimonies to the victim recounting her traumatic experiences, the court was provided with a thorough understanding of the extent of his crimes. The jury, after careful deliberation, found Weberman guilty on all 59 counts, which included charges of sexual assault, endangering the welfare of a child, and other related offenses. This unanimous verdict delivered a decisive and much-needed message that these heinous acts will be justly punished by the law. Facing 117 Years in Prison Unsurprisingly, the severity of Weberman's actions will likely be met with an equally severe and appropriate punishment. He now faces the possibility of a staggering 117-year prison sentence. Though no sentence can ever truly compensate for the unimaginable suffering faced by the victim, this lengthy sentence would ensure that Weberman spends the rest of his life held accountable for his actions, and sends a powerful message of deterrence to others who may consider committing similar acts. District Attorney Expresses Hope for Others to Come Forward This groundbreaking case has highlighted the importance and power of survivors coming forward and steadfastly seeking justice. As the District Attorney in the case expressed, she hopes that the outcome of this trial will encourage other abuse victims to seek the help they need and come forward to expose their abusers. The path to justice can be a long and painful one, but it is crucial to recognize that our legal system is built to protect victims and ensure that criminals are duly punished. By coming forward with their own stories, survivors of abuse can help prevent further acts of cruelty and abuse, and pave the way for a safer society for all children. Conclusion The case of Weberman is a stark reminder of the prevalence and severity of child abuse. While his conviction and potential 117-year sentence can in no way undo the damage caused, it serves as a strong example of justice served and the power of legal recourse. It is essential for all to recognize their duty to protect children and to create a society in which these despicable acts are neither perpetrated nor tolerated, and the brave survivors of such abuse may continue to come forward and be met with support, understanding, and meaningful justice."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step is: The water source becomes contaminated with pollutants (e.g., chemicals, waste, or excessive nutrients)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: After starting the season strongly, including a five-win run in September and October, the Chargers were beset by a string of injuries to key players, and eventually finished the season at 9-7. In contrast to 2013, the record was not enough to make the playoffs. The Chargers began the season 5–1, winning five straight after losing their season opener. It was followed by a three-game losing streak, and they finished 4–4 in the second half. They won just two of their final five games, coming back from double-digit fourth quarter deficits twice to remain in playoff contention. They lost the final game of the season when a win would have secured a playoff berth. In three of their last four games, and five of their last eight, the Chargers did not score more than one touchdown. Compared to 2013, the offense dropped in points (from 12th in the league to 17th), yards (5th to 18th), first downs (3rd to 15th), net yards per pass (2nd to 8th), rushing yards (13th to 30) and yards per rush (21st to 31st). It was the second time in three years the team finished second-to-last in yards per carry. San Diego was just 2–4 against teams in their division in the AFC West, and were swept by both the Denver Broncos and the Kansas City Chiefs. It was their worst intradivision record since they were 1–5 in 2003. The Chargers were only 3–6 against teams with winning records. They matched their 9–7 record from 2013, but missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons. Did the Chargers win or lose more games against teams with winning records?","completion":"The Chargers won fewer games against teams with winning records. They had a 3-6 record against teams with winning records during that season. This means they won 3 games and lost 6 games when facing teams with winning records."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

[A]. yes. [B]. it is not possible to tell. [C]. no.","completion":"[C]. no. It does not follow that \\"It is detrimental to do things together.\\" The statement, \\"if you can do things together that really helps a lot,\\" implies that working together or collaborating can lead to positive outcomes and be beneficial in certain circumstances. This statement does not inherently suggest that doing things together is harmful or detrimental. Instead, it promotes the idea that teamwork, collaboration, and partnership can foster success. There can be various scenarios where doing things together can be advantageous. For instance, in a work setting, collaboration can encourage creativity and lead to innovative solutions. When team members share their knowledge, skills, and experiences, it often results in a more comprehensive and effective outcome. In personal relationships, engaging in activities together can strengthen bonds and foster a sense of belonging and connection. However, it is important to note that the appropriateness of doing things together can depend on the context and the individuals involved. In some situations, working independently or allocating specific tasks to different people can be more suitable and productive. Additionally, individual preferences and personal styles may influence whether doing things together is perceived as helpful or detrimental. In summary, while the initial statement highlights the potential benefits of collaboration, it does not assert that doing things together is always detrimental. Instead, it emphasizes the value of teamwork and shared efforts in particular circumstances. Therefore, the answer is \\"no,\\" as collaboration can be advantageous in many situations, and the context and participants involved play a vital role in determining whether it is beneficial or detrimental."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While the historical context mentioned is related to the topic, it is not a direct answer to the question asked. A more accurate response to the question \\"When is it Memorial Day?\\" would be: Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday of May each year in the United States. It is a federal holiday dedicated to remembering and honoring the men and women who died while serving in the U.S. military. The holiday is marked with various ceremonies and events, including visiting cemeteries, participating in parades, and flying the American flag at half-staff. Memorial Day also unofficially marks the beginning of the summer season. As for the historical context, the origins of Memorial Day date back to the aftermath of the American Civil War, when various communities began holding tributes for fallen soldiers by decorating their graves with flowers and flags. It was first observed on May 30, 1868, and was initially known as Decoration Day. Over time, it evolved into what is now called Memorial Day, with the last Monday of May designated as the official holiday.

My friend and I picked \\"Paperhouse\\" out of a random pile of movies on our weekly excursion to the Horror section-- neither of us had heard of it, but the blurb on the box was really promising. And the movie didn't disappoint, though I still probably wouldn't call it a horror movie exclusively. 11-year old Anna Madden draws a house, and visits it in her dreams. She is definitely asleep when she's seeing the house, but it's so real in a sense that it's almost like a completely separate reality. Which, in view of later events, doesn't seem like a far cry from the truth. Anyhow, she finds she can add to the house, its contents and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture. While this is going on, Anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever, and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing. On top of that, she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father; he has a job that takes him away for long stretches, though one gets the impression there's actually more to the story than that. OK, so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough-- but frankly there's something really menacing about it. The dreamworld is eerily surreal -- the house, for instance, is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field. The folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate world/ongoing dream... One of the things Anna adds to the house is a boy, Mark, who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about (I'm not giving that away, you know from the moment he appears that it's the same kid). In reality, Mark can't walk due to an illness; in Anna's drawing-world, he can't walk because she didn't draw him any legs. She blames herself for his real-life illness, and tries to rectify the situation, but... everything starts getting really weird. She even brings her absent father into the drawing, with disastrous results. The bits with the father are really terrifying. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll stop there... There seems to be a lot going on in this film. I'm sure you'll have a ball analyzing this thing do death with your pals after you watch it-- Is it a simple a story as it seems, or are there actually layers of meaning? I don't know, but either way it's quite fascinating. There was a \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\"-ish quality about it, in that at a certain point reality and dreams intersect. I love things like that. My only complaint is that it feels like it COULD have ended many times, but didn't. I'm satisfied with the ending it had (some of you sensitive types might want to have Kleenex handy!), though it really could have a variety of conclusions. Anyway, it doesn't exactly feel drawn out once it's actually over, but while you're watching and it keeps fading back in, it's a little nerve wracking. Still, \\"Paperhouse\\" is a really GOOD film. It's well done, and acting-- especially Charlotte Burke as Anna-- is top notch. Burke, who has never before or since appeared in a film, is a real gem. I don't know why she never went onto do anything else, but either way she's really convincing and enjoyable to watch. \\"Paperhouse\\" isn't exactly a horror movie, it's sort of a fantasy/suspense/something else type of movie, with some definite horroresque moments-- but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get grossed out by blood splashing or something.

The film stars Rudy Vallée, Jimmy Durante, Alice Faye, Adrienne Ames, Gregory Ratoff, Cliff Edwards and Dixie Dunbar. The film was released on March 16, 1934, by Fox Film Corporation. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? George White's Scandals has no sound.","completion":"No, the statement \\"George White's Scandals has no sound\\" does not follow the given preceding text. Allow me to explain why. George White's Scandals, released in 1934, is classified as a musical film. By definition, a musical film is a movie genre that incorporates songs, music, and typically dance sequences, all of which require synchronization with sound. Moreover, the film stars notable actors and singers of the time, such as Rudy Vallée, Jimmy Durante, and Alice Faye, who were known for their singing abilities. Inclusion of these performers in the film further implies that the film contains sound elements. Additionally, it is essential to note that the transition from silent films to \\"talkies\\" (films with synchronized sound) occurred during the late 1920s with the widespread adoption of sound technology, such as the Vitaphone and Movietone systems. Fox Film Corporation, which released George White's Scandals, was one of the major studios that embraced sound during this period. Considering all these factors, it can be concluded that the statement \\"George White's Scandals has no sound\\" contradicts the preceding information, as it is highly implausible for a 1934 musical film to lack sound."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Here is a step-by-step solution: Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side of the equation. -32*z - 31*z = (-32 - 31)*z = -63*z The equation now becomes: -63*z + 884 = 17*z + 2564 Step 2: Move the term with the variable to one side of the equation and the constant to the other side. To do this, we'll add 63*z to both sides of the equation to move the term with the variable to the right side: -63*z + 884 + 63*z = 17*z + 2564 + 63*z This simplifies to: 884 = 80*z + 2564 Step 3: Move the constant term to the other side of the equation. Now, we'll subtract 2564 from both sides to isolate the term with the variable: 884 - 2564 = 80*z + 2564 - 2564 This simplifies to: -1680 = 80*z Step 4: Solve for z. To find the value of z, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 80: -1680/80 = 80*z/80 This simplifies to: -21 = z So, the solution for the given equation is z = -21."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Obama to be urged to split cyberwar command from NSA The Pentagon and intelligence community are expected to recommend soon to President Obama that he break up the joint leadership of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command to create two distinct forces for electronic espionage and cyberwarfare. The potential move is driven by a sense that the two missions are fundamentally different, that the nation’s cyberspies and military hackers should not be competing to use the same networks and that the job of leading both organizations is too big for one person. Obama was on the verge of ending the “dual-hat” leadership in late 2013, but was persuaded to hold off when senior officials, including then-NSA Director Keith B. Alexander, argued against it on the grounds that the two organizations needed one leader to ensure that NSA did not withhold resources from CyberCom. [White House opts to keep spy agency and cyberwar force under one leader] Three years later, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper are pressing for the split, with Carter seeking to build Cyber Command into a full-fledged fighting force that has its own network accesses to conduct attacks. Clapper, officials said, supports the idea in part to reduce tension over which force gets to use the networks — the spooks or the warfighters. And with the White House apparently eager to get it done before Obama’s term ends, some officials said that the decision appears all but certain. Carter and Clapper also favor having a civilian in charge of the NSA, as at CIA. That would be a break from tradition. Since its inception in 1952, the NSA has been led by a military officer. The proposed decision reflects a growing debate over how to organize military cyberoperations as they mature and diverge from the intelligence realm that birthed them. Adm. Michael S. Rogers, currently the head of the NSA and CyberCom, last week told an audience at the Intelligence & National Security Summit that “I believe in the long run the right thing is to keep these two [organizations] aligned, but to separate them.” But on Tuesday, Rogers clarified his remarks to suggest now was not the time. At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the chairman, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), noted Rogers earlier this year supported retaining the “dual-hat” relationship. “Is it still your professional advice” that such an arrangement is in CyberCom’s best interests? McCain asked. “Yes,” Rogers replied. McCain also issued a warning to the administration. If it separated the two organizations, McCain said he would oppose any nominee put forward to head the NSA if that person is not also picked to lead Cyber Command. Cyber Command, established in 2009 inside NSA headquarters at Fort Meade, Md., has long depended on the spy agency’s capabilities. NSA and Cyber Command personnel sit side-by-side and use the same networks that were built by the agency. But following revelations of NSA surveillance programs by former contractor Edward Snowden, a presidential commission recommended that NSA and Cyber Command be separated, arguing that the intelligence-gathering and combat functions have distinct targets and purposes. The spies want to steal information without getting caught. The fighters want to disrupt systems and don’t mind if the enemy knows who did it. Carter has brought Cyber Command into the fight against the Islamic State and wants it to act openly, like other military commands, rather than as the annex of a highly secretive spy agency. He also wants Cyber Command to control the resources it needs. [U.S. military has launched a new digital war against the Islamic State] “Whether or not it’s true, the perception with Secretary Carter and [top aides] has become that the intelligence agency has been winning out at the expense of [cyber] war efforts,” said one senior military official, who like other officials interviewed for this article spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Pentagon declined comment. “We are constantly reviewing if we have the appropriate organizational structures in place to counter evolving threats, in cyberspace or elsewhere,” one senior administration official said. “While we have no changes to this structure to announce, the relationship between NSA and Cyber Command is critical to safeguarding our nation’s security.” Some former officials believe that Cyber Command can never be fully independent of the NSA and that it makes no sense to cleave one from the other. “When you have two organizations whose missions overlap or touch, unless you have some way to control both of them, then they will instantly go to war with each other,” one former senior intelligence official said. “Cyber Command’s mission, their primary focus, is to degrade or destroy,” the former official said. “NSA’s is exploit [to gather intelligence] only. So without having one person as the leader for both, the bureaucratic walls will go up and you’ll find NSA not cooperating with Cyber Command to give them the information they’ll need to be successful.” On Capitol Hill, the Senate Intelligence Committee has put language in its 2017 intelligence authorization bill that bars the NSA director from serving at the same time as the Cyber Command head. The Senate Armed Services Committee, however, is reluctant to see a split until the defense secretary and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certify to Congress that such an arrangement will not “pose risks” to the military effectiveness of Cyber Command. There is a uniform agreement, however, that if joint leadership is ended the two organizations must still work closely with one another. They would need to ensure that operations don’t interfere with each other’s and that the NSA must continue to supply CyberCom with intelligence. Military officials said that Cyber Command could develop its own network nodes or “accesses” to carry out missions independent of the NSA, although some are skeptical that it can be done without spending substantial sums to duplicate NSA’s infrastructure. “The country can’t afford it,” the former intelligence official said. “NSA’s a trillion-dollar investment.” Others disagreed. “It’s not like you have to rebuild all of NSA in order for Cyber Command to be independent,” a second administration official said. If the separation goes forward, a key challenge will be funding for Cyber Command to develop the capabilities it needs. The command is still building up its force structure, aiming for 6,200 personnel by October 2018. Missy Ryan contributed to this report.

Elizabeth Short (July 29, 1924 - January 14 or 15, 1947), known posthumously as \\"the Black Dahlia\\", was an American woman who was found murdered in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. Her case became highly publicized due to the graphic nature of the crime, which entailed her corpse having been mutilated and severed at the waist. A native of Boston, Short had spent her early life in Massachusetts and Florida before relocating to California, where her father lived. In late 1942, Phoebe received a letter of apology from her presumed-deceased husband, which revealed that he was in fact alive and had started a new life in California. In December, at age eighteen, Elizabeth relocated to Vallejo to live with her father, whom she had not seen since she was six years old. At the time, he was working at the nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard on San Francisco Bay. Arguments between Short and her father led to her moving out in January 1943. Shortly after, she took a job at the base exchange at Camp Cooke (now Vandenberg Air Force Base), near Lompoc, California, living with several friends, and briefly with an Air Force sergeant who was reportedly abusive to her. Short left Lompoc in mid-1943 and moved to Santa Barbara, where she was arrested on September 23, 1943 for underage drinking at a local bar. The juvenile authorities sent her back to Medford, but she returned instead to Florida, making only occasional visits to Massachusetts. While in Florida, she met Major Matthew Michael Gordon, Jr., a decorated US Army Air Force officer at the 2d Air Commando Group. He was training for deployment to the China Burma India Theater of Operations of World War II. She told friends that he had written to propose marriage while he was recovering from injuries from a plane crash in India. She accepted his offer, but Gordon died in a second crash on August 10, 1945, less than a week before the Japanese surrender ended the war. She relocated to Los Angeles in July 1946 to visit Army Air Force Lieutenant Joseph Gordon Fickling, whom she had known from Florida. Fickling was stationed at the Naval Reserve Air Base in Long Beach. Short spent the last six months of her life in Southern California, mostly in the Los Angeles area; shortly before her death, she had been working as a waitress, and rented a room behind the Florentine Gardens nightclub on Hollywood Boulevard. Short has been variously described and depicted as an aspiring or \\"would-be\\" actress.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What was the name of the sand split that occurred on the north end of the island? from the following article ? In 1965, the activity on the main island diminished, but at the end of May that year an eruption began at a vent 0.6 km (0.37 mi) off the northern shore. By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named Syrtlingur (Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the main vent. Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of 0.15 km2 (0.058 sq mi). Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.During December 1965, more submarine activity occurred 0.9 km (0.56 mi) southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70 m (230 ft) in height, covering an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 sq mi), during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.Effusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24 cu mi), and the island's highest point was 174 metres (571 feet) above sea level at that time.Since the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size.

Available options: 1). negative 2). positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh 's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination","completion":"This phrase would be considered negative for several reasons: 1. Use of words with negative connotations: The phrase employs words such as \\"fails\\" and \\"nifty\\" which generally carry negative implications. The word \\"fails\\" indicates that something did not succeed or meet expectations, while \\"nifty\\" can evoke the idea that the plot could have been clever or innovative, but somehow did not reach that potential. 2. Comparison with a successful movie: By comparing the plot to a well-known successful film, \\"Steven Soderbergh's Traffic,\\" the phrase establishes an expectation for the quality of the work in question. However, this expectation is immediately crushed by the phrase \\"fails to arrive at any satisfying destination,\\" which suggests that the plot did not meet those expectations and was ultimately unsatisfactory. 3. Lack of a clear, positive message: The phrase does not include any positive claims or indications about the storyline. Instead, it focuses on the idea that the plot could have been better or on par with another successful film, but ultimately did not accomplish this. Rectifying this by mentioning a redeeming quality of the story could change the overall tone to be more positive or at least neutral. 4. Inability to achieve a satisfying destination: The phrase specifically says the storyline \\"fails to arrive at any satisfying destination.\\" This point emphasizes the disappointment felt by the reader or viewer and doesn't leave room for interpretation. The use of \\"any\\" further strengthens the negative tone by suggesting that no aspect of the conclusion was satisfying. 5. Overall tone and impression: The overall impression given by this phrase is one of disappointment and dissatisfaction. The writer seems to have had high hopes for the plot due to its potential similarities to a successful film but feels that it ultimately failed to live up to those expectations. The tone is critical, with no mitigating factors or compliments to balance the negative judgment. In summary, the phrase can be considered negative due to the use of words with negative associations, the unfulfilled expectations in comparison with a successful film, the absence of positive statements, and the overall tone of disappointment and dissatisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maybe some visitors would be surprised when they first come to India. When they talk to an Indian, they would find he would often shake his head. The visitors might think that the Indian doesn't like what they say. But in fact, they would be completely wrong. Indians always shake their heads when they talk to others. It doesn't mean \\"No\\". If someone wants to visit India, he should know this, or he will be in trouble. One day, a foreign officer went to India on business. He hired a car and asked an Indian to drive him. When he told his driver to take him to his office, the Indian shook his head at once. The officer said again and the driver shook his head again. At last the officer, of course, got angry. \\"How dare you refuse my order?\\" he shouted, \\"Drive me to my office at once!\\" The driver answered in quite a loud voice, too. \\"Yes, sir!\\" But to the officer's surprise, the driver shook his head at the same time. The car started and the foreign officer was now too surprised to say a word. He thought about it for a while, and then he nodded with a smile, \\"'No' means 'Yes' here!\\" What does shaking one's head mean all over the world? A) Yes. B) No. C) Glad. D) Yes or No.","completion":"Shaking one's head can have different meanings across cultures and it's essential to understand this when interacting with people from different countries. It's not accurate to assign a single meaning to head shaking, as it may vary depending on the context and cultural background of the person. A) Yes: In India, for example, head shaking is often used to express agreement or say \\"Yes\\" during a conversation. This can be quite confusing for visitors who may misinterpret this gesture as disapproval or disagreement. This Indian head shake, also known as the head bobble, is a subtle, smooth tilting of the head from side to side and is used by locals to signal agreement, understanding, or acknowledgement. B) No: In most Western cultures and countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and European countries, shaking one's head typically means \\"No.\\" It is a side-to-side head movement that signifies disagreement, rejection, or disapproval. This is probably the most recognized meaning of head shaking globally. C) Glad: Head shaking is not conventionally associated with expressing gladness. However, a person might shake their head in disbelief and smile at the same time if they hear good or surprising news, which can convey happiness or gladness. D) Yes or No: In some situations, a head shake might not have a clear meaning or can be used to express a mixed response like \\"yes or no\\" - this is not the standard interpretation and might be found in specific situations where the person does not want to give a definite answer. In summary, head shaking can have different meanings depending on the cultural context and the situation. While in Western cultures, it often means \\"No,\\" in countries like India, it can represent an affirmative response. Being aware of these differing interpretations can help avoid misunderstandings and foster effective communication across cultures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Julia (Kristina Copeland) travels with her husband Steven Harris (Steven Man) and their baby son Alex to spend a couple of days with her family in Savage Island, an island of their own. The couple expects to resolve their issues along the weekend in the remote island. While waiting for the boat, Julia and Steven meet two weird men in the harbor, and when her brother Peter (Brendan Beiser) arrives, he explains that a family of hillbilly squatters is living in the island. The reckless Peter smoke pot while driving the truck in the night and turns the headlight off to show off; however, he accidentally runs over the young son of the Savage's family, but in the dark he believes he has hit an animal. Later, the Savage family claims Alex as a compensation for their lost son. The Young family does not accept the trade, and they initiate a deadly war between families. \\"Savage Island\\" is a very low-budget movie, with a stupid screenplay, amateurish cinematography but surprisingly good acting. The flawed story is totally absurd, and there are many unbelievable situations. For example, how could two men leave two women with the baby alone in the road during the night with the menace of the deranged family? The logical procedure would be going immediately to the continent and bringing police force to rescue Peter. Then the Young family vanishes; Julia and Steven leave their car in the continent and their house and friends, and nobody chases them? Peter calls his sister Julia of Alex when he arrives with the boat in the beginning. There are so many flaws in this flick that I could spend many lines writing about this subject.

The sentence \\"The region was then run by the Muslim house of Arakkal, followed by Tipu Sultan\\" suggests a simple chronological sequence of rule. First, the region was governed by the Muslim house of Arakkal and then the rule was taken over by Tipu Sultan. It signifies that the Arakkal family and Tipu Sultan were two different and consecutive ruling entities. On the other hand, the sentence \\"The region then followed the Muslim house of Arakkal, which was ruled by Tipu Sultan\\" suggests that the Muslim house of Arakkal, which was under Tipu Sultan's rule, had the control over the region. This indicates that Tipu Sultan was the ruler of the Muslim house of Arakkal and thereby governed the region, rather than being a separate entity taking over the reign from the Arakkal family. The connection indicated by \\"which\\" portrays a relationship where Tipu Sultan is directly related to the Arakkal house. So, no, these two sentences do not have the same meaning. They speak of different political scenarios in the regional governance.

While all the given options may play a role in raising a happy child, the most suitable and crucial factor contributing to a child's happiness is the presence of a loving and supportive couple who can provide a nurturing environment for the child to grow and develop in. A loving couple, whether biological parents, adoptive parents, or guardians, can create a positive and enriching atmosphere that is conducive to the child's happiness and well-being. Here are some key aspects that can make a child happy in a family environment: 1. Emotional support: A loving couple can provide emotional support to their child by being open to communication, encouraging the expression of emotions, and validating the child's feelings. This creates a strong foundation for the child's emotional well-being and helps them grow into a secure and balanced adult. 2. Bonding and attachment: Secure attachment is crucial for a child's emotional and psychological growth. A loving couple can foster a strong bond with their child by spending quality time together, cuddling, and showing physical affection, leading to a happy and secure attachment. 3. Encouragement and praise: Children need positive reinforcement and encouragement to build their self-esteem and confidence. A loving couple can provide this by praising their child's achievements, supporting their interests and hobbies, and helping them learn from their mistakes. 4. Stability and consistency: A stable and consistent family environment can significantly contribute to a child's happiness. A loving couple can establish this by setting clear rules and expectations, following routines, and providing a sense of security and predictability to the child. 5. Teaching empathy and compassion: A loving couple can instill empathy and compassion in their child by demonstrating these qualities themselves and teaching their child to understand and care for the feelings of others. This will help the child develop strong, positive relationships and lead a fulfilling, happy life. 6. Modeling healthy relationships: One of the most important aspects of raising a happy child is to model healthy relationships. A loving couple can do this by maintaining open communication, resolving conflicts in a constructive manner, supporting each other, and providing a positive example of a healthy partnership. In conclusion, a loving couple, regardless of whether they are biological, adoptive, or guardian, plays a vital role in raising a happy child. By nurturing the child emotionally, providing a stable environment, and modeling healthy relationships, a loving couple can ensure that the child grows up to be a well-adjusted, secure, and happy individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To live a happy, healthy, balanced life, you must learn to focus your energy on well-being. Self-care on all levels should be an integral part of your lifestyle. There is an abundance of information available about the benefits of eating well and exercising regularly to sustain a healthy mind and body. In fact, I write about both regularly. But today I want to move in a little different direction. In addition to those two very basic and critical activities, there are a number of other things you can to improve your mental health and overall well-being. By incorporating them into your daily life, you will be better able to manage most challenges – including struggles with self-doubt, anxiety, and mild depression. Practices that Focus Your Energy on Well-being Accept Your Feelings Stuffing or ignoring your emotions is more damaging than it is helpful. Everyone has emotions. They are a natural part of being human. Bottling them up may seem like a good solution in the moment, but when you do it all the time, you are potentially creating a time bomb that will eventually explode. Unfortunately, you are hurting yourself as you hold them in and you run the risk of hurting those you love when the eruption finally occurs. Rather than acknowledging what you are feeling and allowing yourself to experience emotions, you may medicate, rationalize, blame, bury, deny, smother, drink, or stuff them (pretend they don’t exist). Emotions have become the enemy and many people will do anything to avoid them – especially the big three: fear, anger and sadness. It takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy to avoiding your feelings and creates high levels of stress and anxiety. Don’t stuff your emotions! Let yourself laugh, cry, scream, yell, or pound something (preferably a pillow, grass, sand – not the wall or someone else). Do whatever you need to do, probably in private is the best choice. But, if emotions erupt in public, excuse yourself and let it rip. This is nature’s way of releasing stress. Don’t beat yourself... What takes a lot of mental, physical and emotional energy?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: (CNN)It's three down, two to go for Tina Maze. Monday's gold medal win in the Alpine Combined, to go with a silver in the Super-G and gold in the Downhill at this year's Alpine World Ski Championships, means Maze is on the verge of making history. Should success in the Giant Slalom and Slalom follow then the 31-year-old will become the first woman to ever win five individual medals at a single World Championships, with Lasse Kjus of Norway in 1999 the only man to have achieved the feat. \\"I'm more than halfway, so three is done, missing two more,\\" Maze told NBC Sports. \\"I hope I can do it, for sure. It's not easy.\\" The Slovenian's latest triumph at Beaver Creek saw her prevail by 0.22 seconds in an event that combines the downhill and slalom runs, with Austrian duo Nicole Hosp and Michaela Kirchgasser taking silver and bronze respectively. Leading after the morning's downhill section, Maze secured the fifth fastest time in the afternoon's slalom run to finish in a combined time of 2:33.37 to secure gold. Maze, the World Cup overall points leader, landed a fourth world title but her first in the Alpine Combined event -- and she celebrated the success with a cartwheel across the finish area. \\"I'm totally exhausted, it's a tough program and late start time for the slalom and it's also really warm,\\" Maze told the International Ski Federation's official website. \\"But winning is always amazing and now there's time to recover and enjoy. Even though I'm tired I did my best and I'm happy with the win.\\" Her task had been made easier following the disqualification of Lindsey Vonn, who was seen breaking into tears after straddling a gate during her slalom run. The American last week won her first medal at a World Championships in four years with bronze in the Super-G, but Thursday's Giant Slalom now looks to be her only chance of claiming gold at Beaver Creek, having also finished fifth in the Downhill. \\"Just try to forget today as fast as possible and move on to the next race,\\" Vonn told Associated Press. Maze will also be readying herself for the Giant Slalom event, knowing that if she can replicate Monday's form there, as well as in Saturday's Slalom, then her place in the record books will be assured.","completion":"Tina Maze, a skier, won a gold medal in the Alpine Combined race. This is her third medal at the Alpine World Ski Championships. She also has a silver medal in the Super-G race and a gold medal in the Downhill race. If she wins two more races called the Giant Slalom and Slalom, she will be the first woman to win five individual medals at a single World Championships. This would be a very big accomplishment.

Break the touch barrier.","completion":"Title: The Art of Initiating a Kiss: A Guide to Memorable Moments Introduction: Kissing is a beautiful and intimate way to express our feelings of attraction, love, and affection towards someone special. While some kisses are spontaneous and unexpected, initiating a kiss takes confidence, timing, and a bit of finesse. In this article, we will discuss the necessary steps to create the perfect moment for a memorable and delightful kiss. Step 1: Keep your breath fresh and your lips soft The first essential step in preparing for a kiss is maintaining good oral hygiene. To avoid unpleasant surprises, make sure your breath smells fresh by brushing your teeth, using mouthwash, or popping a mint before your encounter. Also, keeping your lips well-moisturized with a good quality lip balm will make the experience much more enjoyable for both of you. Soft, supple lips are far more inviting than dry, cracked ones. Step 2: Pick a moment when you have privacy Privacy is crucial when it comes to initiating a kiss. It not only allows you to avoid potential embarrassment but also creates a comfortable atmosphere where both parties can be true to their feelings. Choose a location and time when you won't be interrupted by other people, loud noises, or other distractions. A quiet, intimate setting will naturally foster a sense of closeness, making the moment just right for a kiss. Step 3: Give him a sincere compliment Compliments are an effective way to create a positive and romantic vibe. Find something you genuinely appreciate in your potential kissing partner, whether it's their appearance, their personality, or an achievement they're proud of. Expressing your admiration can give that extra boost of confidence to both of you, making it much easier to progress with the act of kissing. Step 4: Break the touch barrier Before you move in for a kiss, it's important to establish some physical contact. Breaking the touch barrier can be as simple as placing your hand on their arm or shoulder while talking or gesturing. You can also casually touch their hand while walking together or even embrace them in a warm hug. These subtle touches create a sense of familiarity, closeness, and comfort—making your potential kissing partner more open to the idea of sharing a kiss. Conclusion: Initiating a kiss doesn't need to be a daunting task. By following these simple steps—maintaining fresh breath and soft lips, picking a private moment, giving a sincere compliment, and breaking the touch barrier—you can pave the way for a memorable and lovely kissing experience. Remember to be true to your feelings, respect your partner's boundaries, and, most importantly, enjoy the beautiful moment you've created together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? who won the case in mueller v. oregon?","completion":"The case of Mueller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 (1908), represents a pivotal moment in the American labor movement and in the development of constitutional law. In this case, the state of Oregon successfully defended the constitutionality of a state law that limited the working hours of women in certain industries, most notably laundries and factories. The plaintiff, Curt Mueller, owned and operated a laundry business in Portland, Oregon. He was fined for violating a state law that set a maximum limit of 10 hours for a single day's work for females. Mueller challenged the constitutionality of the law, arguing that it violated the principle of \\"liberty of contract\\" enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Liberty of contract was a popular legal doctrine at the time, which effectively held that individuals should be free to negotiate employment contracts without government intervention. The case ultimately reached the United States Supreme Court, which was faced with deciding whether the Oregon regulation was consistent with the federal Constitution. Oregon was represented by Louis D. Brandeis, who would later become a distinguished justice on the Supreme Court. In defending Oregon's law, Brandeis took an innovative approach known as a \\"Brandeis brief,\\" which emphasized the social, economic, and scientific reasons for the legislation rather than focusing solely on legal doctrine. Brandeis argued that it was within the state's police power to regulate labor conditions for the protection of public health, safety, and morals. He presented overwhelming evidence documenting the physical and psychological toll that long working hours took on women, showing that such regulation was a justified exercise of the state's authority in ensuring the general welfare. Additionally, he demonstrated that curtailing women's working hours would have a positive impact on families, communities, and the economy at large. The Supreme Court, in a 9-0 unanimous decision, upheld Oregon's law. Justice David Brewer delivered the opinion of the Court, finding that the state's interest in protecting women's health justified limitations on their working hours. He acknowledged the vast array of medical and sociological evidence presented by Brandeis, which underscored the need for such protective legislation. The Court held that the state had a legitimate public interest in safeguarding the health of women workers, and that the law was an appropriate means of achieving that end. The ruling in Mueller v. Oregon represented a significant victory for progressive reformers and for the regulation of industrial labor on behalf of worker protection. The Court's willingness to consider social, economic, and scientific evidence in determining the constitutionality of labor regulations opened the door for further protective measures in the future. However, it is important to note that the Court's reasoning was grounded in the belief that women were inherently weaker and in need of special protection, reinforcing gender stereotypes and inequality in that era. As society and the understanding of gender roles have evolved, the legal basis for sustaining such laws has shifted, yet the case remains a landmark in the development of American constitutional law and labor policy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, the heaviest snowfalls have been reported in the mountains of other areas during winter. Snow is even known to fall near the Equator ,but only on the highest mountains. Snow contains much less water than rain, but much of the water the world uses comes from snow. Melting snow provides water for rivers, electric power stations and agricultural crops. In the western United States, mountain snow provides up to seventy-five percent of all surface water supplies. Snowfall helps to protect plants and some wild animals from winter weather. Fresh snow is made largely of air trapped among the snow crystals . Because the air has trouble moving, the movement of heat is limited. Snow also influences the movement of sound waves. The surface of the snow takes in, or absorbs, sound waves. As snow grows older or if there have been strong winds, it can become hard and flat. Then, the snow,s surface will help to send back sound waves. Snow may be beautiful, but it can be deadly. It is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of people. Many people die in traffic accidents on roads covered with snow and ice or from being seriously stuck in the winter storm. Others die from heart attacks caused by too much physical activity out in the cold. People may not be able to avoid living in areas where it snows often. However, they can avoid becoming victims of snowstorms. People should stop driving and stay at home until the storm has passed.

Summarize the following: Constantly forcing yourself to mingle, chit-chat and cold-call will take its toll. Doing things that you hate on a regular basis is a surefire recipe for burnout. Don’t try to be someone you're not. Instead, try to develop a business model that fits the real you and learn to be comfortable with who you truly are. Most importantly, believe that you're as capable as any other person at succeeding in business. Remember, there's nothing \\"wrong\\" with you. It's not bad to prefer one-on-one company over a party. It's not a character flaw to be a great listener. It's not a sin to be a deep thinker. It's not wrong to think before you speak. Keep in mind that, as an introvert, you have a series of character traits that are positive and can help you in business. Speak self-affirmations out loud. If you're feeling a bit insecure because you're an introvert, speak out some self-affirmations that will reinforce your belief in yourself. Introverts have many positive qualities. Use those qualities to your advantage in business. For example, introverts might not be very outspoken, but they're often very good listeners. You'll find that listening can carry you a long way in your business with peers, employees, and partners. Also, introverts tend to be creative because they're inside their own head so much. That creativity can benefit you in business, especially when it comes to advertising. Your ideal office space is a private office where you can retreat, shut the door, and think about how to solve business problems. You'll work best in a quiet, away-from-the-crowd location. Avoid creating an \\"open office\\" environment where you'll be part of the crowd. That kind of workplace is suited well for extroverts, but not for an introvert like you.","completion":"Forcing yourself to engage in activities you dislike can lead to burnout. Instead, embrace your introverted nature and build a business model suited to your strengths. Believe in your capabilities and remember that introverts possess valuable skills in business, such as being great listeners and creative thinkers. Utilize self-affirmations to reinforce confidence in your qualities. Create an ideal office space for introverts, such as a private and quiet room, and avoid open office environments that cater more to extroverts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function.

Michael Abberton was visited by Cambridgeshire police on Saturday after a complaint about a tweet An education official was visited by police because he had upset Ukip on Twitter. Officers knocked at Michael Abberton’s door to question him about a mocked-up poster he had placed online that criticised the Eurosceptic party’s policies. They asked him about his ‘intentions toward Ukip’ and suggested he should tell no one that the visit had taken place. Mr Abberton, a Green party member, said police had overstepped the mark.

Frustrated by the negative publicity, Ukip supporters lodged a complaint with the Cambridgeshire police, alleging that Abberton’s post may have violated electoral law. Upon being visited by the police, Abberton was surprised by the extent to which they questioned him about his opinions and intentions toward Ukip, as well as their insistence on keeping the visit a secret. The Green party member felt that the police had overstepped their authority in this instance, infringing on his freedom of speech and his right to express his political views openly. In response to the incident, the Cambridgeshire police defended their actions as appropriate, maintaining that they were obligated to investigate potential breaches of electoral law, particularly in the highly charged political climate surrounding Ukip and its policies. However, amidst public backlash and growing concerns about censorship, the police admitted that the matter could have been handled more discreetly, without putting undue pressure on Abberton. They also acknowledged that individuals should be able to express political opinions on social media platforms like Twitter, as long as they abide by the relevant laws and guidelines. Ultimately, the incident involving Michael Abberton exposed not only the deep-rooted tensions between rival political parties but also the potential pitfalls of law enforcement agencies engaging in conflicts that may be seen as infringing on individual rights and freedoms. It served as a reminder that the freedom of speech and political expression should be respected and protected by all parties, even in the midst of fierce political debates. However, ensuring that this is balanced with the need to maintain order and prevent the spread of misinformation remains an ongoing challenge for both social media platforms and law enforcement agencies alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?). Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him. These three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about... becoming real Super Heroes. Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career. To bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, C.A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp Champion City into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing C.A. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help. Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise. This film really is a cross-genre romp. Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D.C. Comic's short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. But does that make them genuine super-heroes? Only in their minds. This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvelous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father. Yet, it isn't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it. What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging. The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp. Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well. Yet, overall, this film is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest. 8/10 in my opinion. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The overall sentiment of this review appears to be largely positive.

Please answer the following question: This article: Edmund Sharpe was born on 31 October 1809 at Brook Cottage, Brook Street in Knutsford, Cheshire, the first child of Francis and Martha Sharpe. His father, a peripatetic music teacher and organist at Knutsford parish church, came from Stamford in Lincolnshire. At the time of marriage his wife, Martha Whittaker, was on the staff of an academy for young ladies, Belvedere House, in Bath, Somerset. During his childhood in Knutsford, the young Edmund played with Elizabeth Stevenson, the future Mrs Gaskell. In 1812 the Sharpe family moved across town from Over Knutsford to a farm in Nether Knutsford called Heathside, when Francis Sharpe then worked as both farmer and music teacher. Edmund was initially educated by his parents, but by 1818 he was attending a school in Knutsford. Two years later he was a boarder at a school near Runcorn, and in 1821 at Burney's Academy in Greenwich. Edmund's father died suddenly in November 1823, aged 48, and his mother moved to Lancaster with her family, where she later resumed her teaching career.Edmund continued his education at Burney's Academy, and became head boy. In August 1827 he moved to Sedbergh School (then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, now in Cumbria), where he remained for two years. In November 1829 he entered St John's College, Cambridge as a Lupton scholar. At the end of his course in 1832 he was awarded a Worts Travelling Bachelorship by the University of Cambridge, which enabled him to travel abroad for three years' study. At this time his friend from Lancaster at Trinity College, William Whewell, was Professor of Mineralogy. John Hughes, Edmund Sharpe's biographer, is of the opinion that Whewell was influential in gaining this award for Sharpe. Edmund graduated BA in 1833, and was admitted to the degree of MA in 1836. During his time abroad he travelled in Germany and southern France, studying Romanesque and early Gothic architecture. He had intended to travel further into northern France, but his tour was curtailed in Paris owing to \\"fatigue and illness\\".... contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who moved to Sedbergh School in 1827, where he remained for two years?, what is it ?

They have been studying the characteristics of nocturnal and diurnal animals. Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals. But I can use this background: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. What is an answer for this question: Which zoologist learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day? Answer:","completion":"Nate, the zoologist who studied diurnal animals, learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day. This is because diurnal animals are active during daylight hours and typically sleep or rest during the night. In contrast, Andy studied nocturnal animals, which are active during the night and sleep during the day. Therefore, Andy gained more knowledge about animals that sleep during the day since his research focused on nocturnal species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Spray even, overlapping strokes across the surface. Switch colors as needed. Carefully remove the stencil. Add freehand designs as desired.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Airbrushing Techniques for T-Shirt Designs Introduction: Airbrushing is a versatile and innovative technique that has taken the world of fashion and design by storm. From custom-made t-shirts to personalized works of art, airbrushing enables artists and entrepreneurs alike to unleash their creativity and create unique, eye-catching designs. This article will provide a step-by-step guide on mastering airbrush techniques for t-shirt designs, ensuring that your creations stand out in a crowd and become a wearable expression of your artistic vision. Step 1: Setting up the t-shirt platform: To ensure an even, smooth surface for airbrushing, it is crucial to set up the t-shirt appropriately. Begin by selecting a well-ventilated workspace, free from excess dust and debris. Choose a flat surface, preferably a table or another leveled area, which provides ample space for the t-shirt to lay flat. To further enhance stability, consider attaching the t-shirt to a cardboard or foam board using clips or pins to secure the fabric in place. Step 2: Acquiring the right airbrush and materials: The quality of your airbrushing outcome is often determined by the equipment and materials you choose to use. When selecting an airbrush, consider factors such as size, design, and user-friendliness. Ideally, the airbrush should be comfortable to hold, compatible with various types of paint, and easy to clean. Additionally, ensure that you have a reliable air compressor and a clean air supply. In terms of materials, choose high-quality paint and stencils that cater to your desired design. Step 3: Preparing the t-shirt and paint: Before you start airbrushing, it's important to prep the t-shirt and paint. Begin by washing and thoroughly drying the t-shirt to remove any chemicals or impurities that may affect the final result. It's also a good idea to iron the shirt prior to airbrushing to ensure a smooth, wrinkle-free surface. For the paint, choose a fabric-safe option that will adhere well to the t-shirt material. Mix the paint according to the manufacturer's instructions, and pour it into the airbrush paint cup or reservoir. Step 4: Perfecting your airbrushing technique: Position the airbrush a few inches above the t-shirt and maintain a consistent distance as you spray. Apply the paint using even, overlapping strokes across the surface, ensuring coverage without oversaturating any one area. Practice smooth, fluid motions, steadily controlling the speed with which the paint is released. Adjust your air pressure as needed to accommodate for different types of paint and to achieve your desired outcome. Step 5: Incorporating stencils and multiple colors: Utilize stencils, masks, or even freehand techniques to create personalized, intricate designs. Begin by carefully positioning the stencil onto the t-shirt and securing it in place. Make sure the stencil is smooth and wrinkle-free to avoid any undesired paint bleeding. Switch colors as needed by flushing the airbrush between each new hue, to avoid unwanted color mixing. Keep in mind that incorporating multiple colors may make more complex designs, but it also breathes life into your artwork and enhances its visual appeal. Step 6: Unveiling your masterpiece and adding freehand details: Once your design is complete, carefully remove the stencil, ensuring that the paint is dry to prevent smudging. Reveal your airbrushed creation and take a moment to assess the overall design. If you feel inspired to add more detail or flair to your piece, consider incorporating some freehand elements. This will further personalize your work and give it a truly unique touch that can't be replicated. Step 7: Setting the paint and preserving your creation: For a long-lasting and vibrant result, adhere to the paint manufacturer's guidelines and set the paint using heat or a fixative spray. This will ensure that the design remains pristine even after washing and wearing. Properly care for your airbrushed t-shirt by following the garment's specific care instructions, thereby maintaining the quality and integrity of your wearable work of art. Conclusion: Airbrushing is an amazing way to create one-of-a-kind designs that express your individuality and creativity. By following this guide, you'll master the necessary techniques and materials needed to produce stunning, personalized t-shirts that are sure to leave a lasting impression.

YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site's terms of use. Lance Cpl. David Motari, based in Hawaii with the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, is being \\"processed for separation\\" and received non-judicial punishment, officials said in the statement Wednesday night. The Marine Corps would not specify what that punishment was because of privacy regulations. The statement said Motari received the punishment for his role in the \\"episode which generated international attention.\\" The incident appeared on the Internet web site YouTube in March, sparking outrage from animal rights groups around the world. In the video, Motari is seen throwing the dog off a cliff as it yelps. A second Marine, San Diego-based Sgt. Crismarvin Banez Encarnacion, received non-judicial punishment as well. Janice Hagar, a spokeswoman for the Marines in San Diego, said Encarnacion shot the video. Marine officials at the Pentagon would not disclose the severity of the disciplinary action against Encarnacion, also because of privacy regulations. CNN did not receive a response from the Marine Corps in San Diego to questions about the case. The statement said the Marines conducted an investigation as soon as the YouTube video came to the attention of commanders. \\"The actions seen in the Internet video are contrary to the high standards we expect of every Marine and will not be tolerated,\\" according to the statement. On the video, Motari smiles as he is holding the puppy and then hurls the dog over a cliff. An unknown person operating the video cameras is heard laughing and another voice saying \\"that's mean, Motari.\\" In a statement, the Humane Society of the United States applauded the Marine Corps' decision to punish those involved. \\"The bad actors in this case have been dealt with by the Marine Corps, which rightly recognizes that harming animals is unacceptable conduct,\\" said Dale Bartlett, the group's deputy manager for animal cruelty issues. \\"Now, the Department of Defense and the Congress must step up protection from cruelty for all animals under the law governing military conduct.\\" Highlights:","completion":"1.

Macy's 4th of July Fireworks in New York City is a massive spectacle that has been around for more than four decades. Considered to be one of the most extravagant Independence Day celebrations in the United States, the event garners a viewership of millions every year, both in person and through live television broadcasts. The event takes place on the East River, and the fireworks are set off from several barges strategically positioned in the water body. The fireworks are usually launched between the Brooklyn Bridge and the Midtown area. This strategic location allows for a simultaneous, panoramic view of the fireworks across various points in the city, including popular viewing spots such as parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan. Fireworks for the Macy's show are made by the Pyro Spectaculars by Souza, a California-based company with a five-generation pedigree in the fireworks industry. The display usually lasts for about 30 minutes, and more than 70,000 individual shells are launched during the event, making it the largest annual fireworks display in America. The show is well-known for its choreographed fireworks, synchronization with music, and a grand display of pyrotechnics. Each year, the event features a different theme and a combination of new pyrotechnic effects alongside classic elements. Moreover, the musical score, too, varies every year, often featuring famous musicians and orchestrated performances. In addition to the fireworks, the event also features various other entertainment programs, such as performances by popular singers and bands, live orchestras, and more. The pyrotechnic spectacle combined with the live performances makes the Macy's 4th of July Fireworks a unique and unforgettable experience, contributing to its reputation as the country's largest and most famous fireworks show. Over the years, the Macy's 4th of July Fireworks has become an iconic American event. It embodies the spirit of Independence Day celebrations and is symbolic of American tradition and culture.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What did Napoleon have in reserve?\\" is in \\"Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device Wales captain Sam Warburton played a key role in defence as the Blues clung on to their lead. Kiwi centre Willis Halaholo scored a fine try to nudge the visitors ahead in Italy, after Rhun Williams and Macauley Cook both crossed. Treviso scored four tries inside 45 minutes and claimed two bonus points. Warburton played the full 80 minutes, mostly taking the number eight role despite wearing six, as he showed his fitness for Wales' second autumn series match against Argentina on 12 November. He had not played since 1 October because of cheekbone and neck injuries. It was a nervous night for the visitors, despite RGC product Williams scoring on the overlap just six minutes into his debut for Shingler to convert. Dean Budd wrestled his way over from close range, Alberto Sgarbi crossed after a searing break by Ian McKinley on 17 minutes, and former Scarlets wing Michael Tagicakibau scored a third on 32 minutes. Dubliner fly-half McKinley converted all three while Cardiff Blues could only muster three Shingler penalties in reply as they trailed 21-16 at half-time. That quickly got worse as McKinley's cross-kick to Braam Steyn saw Treviso bag their bonus point just five minutes after the break with the Irishman adding his fourth conversion to put his team 12 points up. But the visitors refused to panic and Cook crossed after good work by Halaholo and Ellis Jenkins, with Shingler adding a penalty to make it 28-24. Then new recruit Halaholo, fresh from a Super Rugby triumph with the Hurricanes, showed his class as he side-stepped his way through the defence for a dazzling score to put the visitors ahead on 64 minutes after Shingler's kick. But the Blues had some nervous moments in the closing stages as Warburton used all his experience to marshal the defence. Sub Edoardo Gori was close with a kick and chase from a tap penalty, and 19-year-old wing Williams pulled off a crucial tackle to prevent a Treviso overlap. Shingler's fifth penalty gave the Blues some breathing space and the Italians gave away penalties at vital moments, as the Welsh region ended a run of three league defeats. Cardiff Blues head coach Danny Wilson told BBC Radio Wales: \\"I'm really pleased with the performance. Some of our attacking rugby was outstanding. We said all week it's a big night if you can get a win out here. \\"With a number of combinations and without a few internationals I thought we really showed a fighting spirit to go and win the game, but we had some defensive errors that let in some tries and that's something we really need to look at. \\"I thought [Sam Warburton's] performance, considering he'd been out for a few weeks, was top-drawer Sam. \\"He went out there and really delivered, led the side well when Matthew [Rees] went off, and I'm sure he'll be back in a Welsh shirt very soon.\\" Treviso: Jayden Hayward, Michael Tagicakibau, Tommaso Benvenuti, Alberto Sgarbi (captain), Angelo Esposito, Ian McKinley, Tito Tebaldi, Nicola Quaglio, Luca Bigi, Simone Ferrari, Filippo Gerosa, Dean Budd, Marco Lazzaroni, Braam Steyn, Marco Barbini.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Montana was born to Joseph Clifford Montana Sr. (1932-2017) and Theresa Marie Bavuso Montana (1935-2004) in New Eagle, Pennsylvania, a borough of Washington County located in the western portion of the state. He grew up in the city of Monongahela, a coal mining town 25 miles (40 km) south of Pittsburgh. His maternal grandparents, Vincenzo \\"James\\" Bavuso and Josephine Savarino Bavuso, were both Italian immigrants. Aided in part by Montana's performance at quarterback, the 49ers advanced to the NFL Playoffs again in 1985; however, they lost in the NFC Wild card game to the New York Giants. In 1986, Montana suffered a severe back injury during week one of the season. The injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the injured reserve list; however, he returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43-17 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. Montana appeared in just eight games that season, and threw more interceptions than touchdown passes for the only time in his career. The 49ers finished the season with a record of 10-5-1. Montana was co-recipient (with Minnesota Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer) of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. In 1987, Montana had 31 touchdown passes, a career-high, in just 13 games. Montana crossed the picket line during the NFLPA strike and threw five touchdowns against replacement players. In 1987, he also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Though the 49ers finished with the best record in the NFL, they lost in the Divisional Round of the playoffs to the Minnesota Vikings. Prior to the 1987 season, Bill Walsh completed a trade for Steve Young, then a quarterback with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Young went on to appear in eight regular season games for the team and finished the year with a passer rating of 120.8.

Read this and answer the question A common way in which emotions are conceptualized in sociology is in terms of the multidimensional characteristics including cultural or emotional labels (e.g., anger, pride, fear, happiness), physiological changes (e.g., increased perspiration, changes in pulse rate), expressive facial and body movements (e.g., smiling, frowning, baring teeth), and appraisals of situational cues. One comprehensive theory of emotional arousal in humans has been developed by Jonathan Turner (2007: 2009). Two of the key eliciting factors for the arousal of emotions within this theory are expectations states and sanctions. When people enter a situation or encounter with certain expectations for how the encounter should unfold, they will experience different emotions depending on the extent to which expectations for Self, other and situation are met or not met. People can also provide positive or negative sanctions directed at Self or other which also trigger different emotional experiences in individuals. Turner analyzed a wide range of emotion theories across different fields of research including sociology, psychology, evolutionary science, and neuroscience. Based on this analysis, he identified four emotions that all researchers consider being founded on human neurology including assertive-anger, aversion-fear, satisfaction-happiness, and disappointment-sadness. These four categories are called primary emotions and there is some agreement amongst researchers that these primary emotions become combined to produce more elaborate and complex emotional experiences. These more elaborate emotions are called first-order elaborations in Turner's theory and they include sentiments such as pride, triumph, and awe. Emotions can also be experienced at different levels of intensity so that feelings of concern are a low-intensity variation of the primary emotion aversion-fear whereas depression is a higher intensity variant.

Death of missing Geelong man Daniel O'Keeffe not suspicious, police confirm Daniel O'Keeffe's remains were found on Monday. (Supplied) The death of Victorian man Daniel O'Keeffe, whose remains were found on Monday more than four years after he vanished, is no longer being treated as suspicious by police. Police were called to Mr O'Keeffe's family home on Summerhill Terrace in Highton, a suburb of Geelong, after his father found human remains beneath the house just before 2pm on Monday. Victoria Police confirmed today the death is not being treated as suspicious. \\"A post mortem examination has been conducted and police have been advised today that no suspicious circumstances have been identified,\\" a police spokeswoman said. \\"Other forensic examinations including DNA testing will also take place which will assist in the identification process. \\"While the current circumstances surrounding the death are not considered to be suspicious, a thorough investigation is being conducted.\\" Daniel O'Keeffe disappeared in July 2011.

The family later confirmed they believed the remains at home were Mr O'Keeffe's. \\"It is with heavy hearts that the family and friends of Dan O’Keeffe, update this page to share that Dan’s remains were discovered earlier today,\\" a post on a Facebook page dedicated to finding Mr O'Keeffe read on Monday. \\"We ask that you keep our family in your thoughts as we navigate this process and that our privacy be respected.

None of this has been in vain, and that's all thanks to you.\\" A high-profile social media campaign, Dan Come Home, was launched after Mr O'Keeffe disappeared on July 15, 2011. The Facebook page searching for answers to Mr O'Keeffe's disappearance has more than 63,000 followers. Then 24, he had a history of anxiety and depression and was about to start a carpentry apprenticeship. \\"We feel he left as an act of love, not wanting to burden us with his illness,\\" the family wrote on the Dan Come Home website. He did not have his ID or wallet on him when he went missing, and his bank accounts have not been used since he was last seen. Mr O'Keeffe's plight sparked a social media backlash in December after the Melbourne Cricket Club refused to suspend his membership. Hundreds of people took to the O'Keeffe family's missing person's Facebook page to condemn the club's decision. Since he went missing his family have paid his MCC membership renewal fees in the hope he would soon return.

The information provided in the premise is as follows: 1. The Enquirer contacted Earl Goss. 2. Earl Goss is the father of Michael's current live-in lover, Kenny Goss. The purpose of the contact, as per the premise, is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, we cannot determine if the conversation between The Enquirer and Earl Goss was about a missile approaching his house without additional context or information. Moreover, a missile approaching a house seems to be quite a significant event that would likely be mentioned directly or indirectly within the premise. The absence of any reference to a missile in the given premise further strengthens the argument that the hypothesis cannot be confirmed solely based on this information. It is important not to assume or infer details that might change the meaning or context of the original premise. In conclusion, based on the provided premise, we cannot confirm the hypothesis \\"The Enquirer contacted Earl about the missile that was approaching his house\\" to be true.

Each star represents one of the 50 states in the United States of America. The stars are arranged in nine rows of alternating five and six stars, and they are placed in the top left corner of the flag, on a blue field known as the union or canton. The current design of the American flag was adopted on July 4, 1960, when Hawaii became the 50th state to join the United States. The flag has undergone several changes throughout its history as new states were added to the Union. The first official flag, known as the \\"Stars and Stripes\\" or \\"Grand Union\\" flag, was created in 1777 and featured 13 stars, which represented the 13 original colonies. The flag has evolved over time to incorporate a star for each new state, ultimately reaching the current design with 50 stars. Apart from the stars, the American flag also consists of 13 horizontal stripes. These stripes represent the original 13 colonies that declared their independence from Great Britain in 1776 – the founding moment for the United States. The stripes are alternating red and white, with seven red stripes and six white stripes. The American flag is an important symbol of national unity and pride, representing the values of freedom, democracy, and perseverance. It plays a significant role in various ceremonies and events across the nation and serves as a reminder of the sacrifice and dedication it took to construct and maintain the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the below context: While Lennon and Starr remained consistently friendly during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told Playboy, \\"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\\"Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a 3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: \\"Throughout my career, I've selected to work with ... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono ...

Answer: Tycho Brahe (14 December 154624 October 1601), born Tyge Ottesen Brahe, was a Danish nobleman known for his accurate and comprehensive astronomical and planetary observations. Question: where was tycho brahe when he discovered mars Answer:","completion":"Tycho Brahe first observed Mars on August 13, 1579, while he was at his observatory called Uraniborg, located on the island of Hven (now a part of Sweden, but was part of Denmark at the time). Uraniborg was one of the world's first custom-built observatories and was designed by Brahe himself. It served as both his residence and his main research facility. Born into a noble Danish family, Tycho Brahe was passionate about astronomy from an early age. His keen interest led him to create and dedicate a significant part of his life to the systematic observation of celestial bodies. His observations of Mars played a crucial role in the development of what would later become known as the Tychonic system, which attempted to reconcile the Copernican and Ptolemaic models of the universe - placing Earth at the center and other planets (except for the Moon) orbiting the Sun, which, in turn, orbited Earth. At Uraniborg, Brahe used large, well-calibrated instruments, including mural quadrants, armillary spheres, and sextants, for his observations. Additionally, he employed a group of assistants who helped record data and maintain the instruments. The accuracy and detail of his observations were unmatched during his lifetime, and it was this level of precision that played a decisive role in the advancement of early observational astronomy. It was also the data collected by Tycho Brahe that later helped his German collaborator and student, Johannes Kepler, to develop his laws of planetary motion. Brahe's determination of Mars' position and orbit, in particular, allowed Kepler to refine his understanding of planetary motion and to redefine the model of the solar system based on mathematical principles. In summary, Tycho Brahe discovered Mars while he was at his observatory, Uraniborg, on the island of Hven. His groundbreaking observations, including those of Mars, contributed significantly to the enhancement of our understanding of the universe and laid the foundation for modern astronomy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar. The new lineup releases the 1987 album All, themed around the philosophical concept of \\"All\\" invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion.

What is the answer?","completion":"The ocean gulf that borders five states, including Florida and Texas, is the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico is a large ocean basin near the southeast of North America, covering approximately 615,000 square miles (1.6 million square kilometers). It lies between the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, the eastern coast of mainland Mexico, the southern United States, and the island of Cuba. In addition to Florida and Texas, the other U.S. states that have a coastline along the Gulf of Mexico are Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. These five states together are often referred to as the \\"Gulf States.\\" The Gulf of Mexico plays a vital role in the economies of these states, providing a rich source of marine life, supporting the fishing industry and the production of seafood. Moreover, the Gulf is also home to vast oil and natural gas resources, making it an important area for the United States in terms of energy production. The region is prone to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, which occasionally cause devastation to the coastal communities and industries situated along its shores. The Gulf of Mexico boasts diverse and vibrant ecosystems ranging from coral reefs to seagrass meadows, mangroves and marshes, to deep-sea habitats that host an incredible variety of marine species. Some of the famous marine life found in the Gulf include dolphins, sea turtles, manatees, and various species of sharks, as well as numerous species of fish like red snapper, grouper, and tarpon. This abundant marine life attracts tourists and recreational fishermen from all around the globe. Furthermore, the Gulf of Mexico is part of the Atlantic Ocean and is connected to the Caribbean Sea via the Yucatan Channel. This vast body of water plays a significant role in the global climate system through its interactions with both the Caribbean Sea and the open Atlantic Ocean. Warm ocean currents, such as the Loop Current and the Gulf Stream, originate in the Gulf of Mexico, transporting warm water and moisture from the tropics to more northern latitudes, thereby influencing weather patterns across North America and Europe. In summary, the Gulf of Mexico is a vital ocean basin that borders Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, playing a fundamental role in the economy, ecology, and climate of the region.

Though the hospital was renowned for its state-of-the-art facilities and expert staff, many patients found themselves facing financial difficulties after undergoing procedures at the heart surgery center. The primary reason behind this issue was that the insurance companies paid too little money for the procedures, shifting the financial burden onto the patients. Step 1: Identify the reason for the heart surgery center not being covered by insurance. In this case, the reason is that the insurance companies paid too little money for the procedure. Step 2: Expand on the consequences of the situation. Patients who relied on their insurance to cover the cost of the procedures found themselves in financial distress due to the insufficient insurance coverage. Step 3: Consider potential solutions for the issue. To address this issue, the heart surgery center could negotiate with insurance companies for better reimbursement rates, lobby for policy reforms, or explore alternative payment methods to ensure adequate financial support for their patients. Step 4: Offer some hope or encouragement for those affected by the issue. While addressing the issue of lower insurance coverage might be challenging, patients need to advocate for their rights and seek help from appropriate organizations and advocates to find a resolution. Going forward, reevaluating insurance plans and considering alternative options like supplemental insurance coverage might be crucial steps to ensure patients are well-prepared to secure the financial resources needed for crucial medical procedures like heart surgeries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do that, we add 489s to both sides of the equation: 1246*s + 34700 + 489*s = -489*s + 489*s Now you combine the 's' terms on the left side: (1246 + 489)*s + 34700 = 0 1735*s + 34700 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable 's' Now, we isolate 's' by moving the constant term (34700) to the opposite side of the equation. To do this, we subtract 34700 from both sides of the equation: 1735*s + 34700 - 34700 = 0 - 34700 1735*s = -34700 Step 3: Solve for 's' Finally, to solve for 's', we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 's' which is 1735: 1735*s / 1735 = -34700 / 1735 s = -20 So, the solution for s is -20."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft. Question: \\"Why would the hijackers have to jam their way in?\\" Answer: \\"The door was stuck\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. The correct answer should be as follows: The hijackers may have needed to jam their way into the cockpit because the FAA rules required cockpit doors to remain closed and locked during flight to ensure the pilots' safety and the security of the aircraft. Jamming their way in would bypass these security measures, allowing them to take control of the airplane and execute their hijacking plan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: Two reputed white supremacists have been arrested in Virginia for allegedly plotting to attack black churches and Jewish synagogues, according to federal authorities. Robert Curtis Doyle and Ronald Beasley Chaney III were arrested Sunday after a months-long investigation that sent FBI agents in to disrupt a plan allegedly already underway, according to charging documents filed in federal court. In late September, the FBI received a tip that Doyle and Chaney would be meeting the next week to discuss a plot to shoot or bomb worshippers inside black churches and Jewish synagogues, and to attack a specific gun store owner in Oklahoma, according to the FBI. After putting the pair under surveillance, an undercover FBI agent posing as an illegal arms dealer met with Chaney and Doyle and let them handle certain weapons, the FBI said. Doyle then allegedly placed an order for an automatic weapon, explosives and a pistol with a silencer, according to the FBI. Though at one point Chaney raised suspicions with Doyle over whether it was all a “Fed operation ... [to] infiltrate ... our [expletive] people,” Chaney ultimately moved forward with the weapons purchase, according to the FBI. On Sunday, Chaney tried to buy the firearms and explosives from three undercover FBI agents and he was immediately arrested, the FBI said. Doyle was arrested later Sunday at his home in Chesterfield, Virginia. The two men have each been charged with one count of conspiracy to possess firearms after having been convicted of a felony. A preliminary and detention hearing is set for Thursday in Richmond. Doyle was previously convicted of possessing and distributing drugs, embezzlement, and grand larceny. Chaney has also been convicted of multiple felonies, according to the FBI. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video CHESTERFIELD COUNTY, Va. -- Federal court documents provide some disturbing details about an apparent plot by white supremacists in Chesterfield to incite a race war. They include plans to bomb and shoot up black churches and Jewish synagogues, as well as a plot to kill a local jewelry dealer, and rob an armored car, among other crimes. The crimes were to provide the proceeds to purchase land, weapons and training for the so-called coming race war. But they were apparently foiled by the FBI. Neighbors said they saw federal agents swarming around a Chesterfield home around 11 a.m. Sunday. “I walked to the end of the cul-de-sac, and saw 15 police cars, marked and unmarked, and K-9’s searching,” said a woman who did not want to be identified. “There were people wearing camo and carrying big weapons.\\" The documents reveal that, Robert Doyle and Ronald Beasley Chaney and others ascribing to a white supremacist version of the Asatru faith met inside a home on Candlelamp Lane in Chesterfield. The FBI received information that during a meeting there in late September members discussed acting out their extremist beliefs by shooting or bombing occupants of black churches and Jewish synagogues and plotting to kill an Oklahoma gun store owner. It also alleged that Doyle met up with Charles Halderman of Henrico to plan the murder of a local jeweler, rob an armored truck and harm a Virginia gun store owner. All three men are charged with one felony, for now. \\"With all the allegations in there, this one charge is just the tip of the iceberg,” said CBS 6 legal expert Todd Stone. “I expect other serious charges.\\" \\"It's always in the back of your mind,” said Rodney Clarke, the chairman of the trustees of a Baptist church near where investigators said the extremists’ meeting took place. “This is right around the corner.\\" Clarke said even before hearing the details in these documents, their church had already started securing the sanctuary. \\"It's a shame you can't worship your god in peace,” he said. “You try to have your focus on him, but you have to worry about what's coming through the door.\\" The documents allege that Doyle had met with an undercover agent numerous times and checked out automatic weapons, explosives and silencers he wanted to purchase.

If \\"A cat watches as a man in a long-sleeved shirt and boxer shorts carves a pumpkin.\\", does this mean that \\"An animal watching a man.\\"?","completion":"To determine if the statement \\"A cat watches as a man in a long-sleeved shirt and boxer shorts carves a pumpkin.\\" can be simplified to \\"An animal watching a man.\\", I will analyze the key components of the given sentence and evaluate if they can be generalized to the second statement. Step 1: Identify the key components of the given sentence. - A cat (subject) - Watches (verb) - A man in a long-sleeved shirt and boxer shorts (object) - Carves a pumpkin (additional action) Step 2: Establish the relationship between the key components. - The cat (subject) is observing/witnessing the action of the man (object). - The man is engaged in carving a pumpkin (additional action). Step 3: Compare the original sentence with the simplified statement. - The simplified statement is: \\"An animal watching a man.\\" Step 4: Determine if the simplified statement generalizes the key components and relationship. - The cat is an example of an animal, so \\"A cat\\" can be generalized to \\"An animal\\". - The verb \\"watches\\" is maintained in the simplified statement, which indicates the action of observing. - The man remains the object of focus in both statements. - The act of carving a pumpkin is excluded from the simplified statement since it is not necessary to convey the main idea of the animal watching the man. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the given sentence \\"A cat watches as a man in a long-sleeved shirt and boxer shorts carves a pumpkin.\\" can be simplified and generalized to the statement \\"An animal watching a man.\\" Both statements convey that an animal (a cat) is observing a man, and the extra details about clothing and pumpkin carving are not essential for understanding the core concept."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Does happiness have a scent? When someone is happy,can you smell it? You can usually tell when someone is happy based on seeing them smile,hearing them laugh or perhaps from receiving a big hug.But can you also smell their happiness? Surprising new research suggests that happiness does indeed have a scent,and that the experience of happiness can be transmitted through smell,reports Phys.org. For the study,12 young men were shown videos meant to bring about a variety of emotions while researchers gathered sweat samples from them.All of the men were healthy and none of them were drug users or smokers,and all were asked to abstain from drinking or eating smelly foods during the study period. Those sweat samples were then given to 36 equally healthy young women to smell,while researchers monitored their reactions.Only women were selected to smell the samples,apparently because previous research has shown that women have a better sense of smell than men and are also more sensitive to emotional signaling--though it's unclear why only men were chosen to produce the scents. Researchers found that the behavior of the women after smelling the scents--particularly their facial expressions--indicated a relationship between the emotional states of the men who produced the sweat and the women who sniffed them. \\"Human sweat produced when a person is happy brings about a state similar to happiness in somebody who breathes this smell,\\" said study co-author Gun Semin,a professor at Koc University in Turkey. This is a fascinating finding because it not only means that happiness does have a scent,but that the scent is capable of transmitting the emotion to others.The study also found that other emotions,such as fear,seem to carry a scent too.This ensures previous research suggesting that some negative emotions have a smell,but it is the first time this has proved to be true of positive feelings.

Write a title for this article: Sunday, August 4th 2002, 2:33AM Today, 8 p.m., ESPN Classic In the calmest of times, Americans pay little attention to intercollegiate wrestling. In the spring of 1970, which was not calm, those watching U.S. college campuses probably weren't handicapping 123- or 167-pound grapplers. Which makes it all the more astonishing that a wrestling match that spring, in the NCAA championships, popped out as one of the most startling sports stories of the century. The word \\"legend\\" suffers from severe overuse, but it fits Gable, and today he remains arguably the best-known legitimate wrestler the country has ever produced. Gable was a machine, as the rerun of the ESPN \\"SportsCentury\\" on his life this night demonstrates. He didn't take up wrestling until he was a teenager, after discarding sports like baseball and swimming because he didn't like breaks in the action. Once he began wrestling, driven in part by the murder of his sister (see related story), he went through Waterloo West High School in Iowa with a 64-0 record. Moving to Iowa State, he won 117 of his first 117 matches. At one point he recorded 25 straight pins. In practice, he would challenge and beat every other wrestler on the Iowa State team, up to the heavyweights. He weighed about 140. His final collegiate match was against Larry Owings of Washington, a sophomore who called on some higher power and took a 7-2 lead. Gable came back to tie him, 8-8. But Owings got a takedown and went on to a 13-11 victory that, as upsets go, ranks right up with Buster Douglas beating Mike Tyson and the Jets beating the Colts. Gable, while shocked, put his head back down and aimed for the 1972 Olympics, where he won a gold medal by finishing six matches without allowing opponents a single point. Not one. He wouldn't even let anyone have an escape. By the mid-'70s he was coaching at Iowa. He proved almost as good at recruiting and teaching as he was at wrestling, probably because he was just as demanding. In 20 years his teams had a 355-21-5 record in dual meets and won 15 national championships. He retired after the 1997 season, when all those years of obsessive training had broken him down so much - more than a dozen knee and back surgeries - that he could no longer get down on the mat to demonstrate holds. His secret? Single-minded devotion, he tells \\"SportsCentury,\\" and that would be hard to argue. He didn't even have the best wrestling technique in the world, his opponents say, but he was a buzzsaw who never wore out. He kept coming and you couldn't stop him. Gable's biggest loss didn't come on wrestling mat The best-known bad thing that happened to Dan Gable was losing his first match ever in the 1970 NCAA Finals. But that wasn't close to the worst thing. Not even a little bit close. The worst thing happened Memorial Day weekend of 1964. Gable, then 15, went away for the weekend on a fishing trip with his parents, Mack and Katie. When they returned home at the end of the weekend, they found Gable's older sister Diane, his only sibling, dead on the living room. She had been sexually assaulted and murdered. She was 19. Traumatic as this would have been under any circumstance, it was compounded because of something Gable now remembers. A 16-year-old neighborhood boy named Tom Kyle, who had recently dropped out of school, had told Dan that he wanted to have sex with Diane and that if she wasn't interested, he might have to hurt her. Dan told his father about this, while they were driving somewhere together. His father stopped the car and started to beat him, suggesting that never saying anything about this conversation made him responsible in part for his sister's murder. It is probably also significant that this wasn't the first time Mack Gable acted on a violent impulse. An investor/real estate salesman, he had been a wrestler himself in high school and he was not reluctant to use corporal punishment on either Dan or Diane while they were growing up. At least once the police were called to the Gable home in Waterloo, Iowa, because Mack Gable seemed to be doling it out a bit too enthusiastically. It didn't help that he also drank too much. Tom Kyle was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Diane Gable. Dan Gable imposed his own sentence. He would become the best wrestler in the world, which involved enough sacrifice and discipline to sound a lot like penance. But the real reason he vowed to excel in wrestling, as he explains in \\"Sports Century,\\" is that he was convinced that his parents needed something big enough to keep them together after this awful tragedy. He was it, wrestling was it, and once he started, it snowballed into his life - a life that has been, in a sense, lived for two.","completion":"Title: \\"Dan Gable: Wrestling Legend's Unyielding Journey to Triumph and Healing\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Egypt is suspending ties with France's famous Louvre museum until the latter returns artifacts that it knew were stolen when it purchased them, the head of the country's antiquities council said Wednesday. Egypt accuses the Louvre museum of failing to make good on promises to return antiquities. Zahi Hawass, director of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said he wrote a letter seven years ago to major museums around the world asking them to consult with Egyptian authorities before buying any ancient Egyptian artifacts from outside sellers. Hawass said the Louvre had bought five murals chipped off the walls from a tomb in Thebes and been stolen by antiquities robbers in the 1980s. He sent a letter to the Louvre a year ago asking that the stolen paintings be returned, he said. The museum promised to return the items but has not followed through, he said. Until it does so, Egypt will suspend its cooperation with the Louvre, Hawass said. A Louvre spokesman declined to comment on Egypt's claims. Egypt maintains antiquities exchange programs with museums around the world. The Louvre is one of the biggest repositories of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world, much of it treasure taken during the time of the French and British occupation of the country. Egypt's position is that artifacts taken by European powers during that period are a fait accompli, but anything taken illegally since Egypt's independence must be returned. This has been one of the major emphases of Hawass since he became head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in 2002. Egypt took similar steps against museums in England and Belgium in the past. Those ties were restored after the artifacts in question were returned, Hawass said. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"Egypt is not happy with France's famous Louvre museum and has decided to stop working together with them for some time. This is because the Louvre bought some very old and special murals that were stolen from Egypt many years ago. Egypt asked the Louvre to give the murals back, but the museum has not done it yet. Egypt wants things taken from them without permission after they became independent to be returned. They have done this with museums in England and Belgium before, and the ties were fixed when the artifacts were given back."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: Who is an unmarried mother? from the following article ?

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"If more rock rushes through the cave, it would directly impact a step of the process. Step-by-step explanation: 1. With more rock rushing through the cave, it will cause more erosion within the cave. 2. This increased erosion will lead to the rock surfaces in the cave being worn down faster and more efficiently. 3. Worn down rock surfaces translate to an expansion of the cave space as the rock material is being removed. 4. The space in the rock will continue to get bigger as this process continues and the water keeps pushing more rocks through the cave. Thus, the supposed perturbation of more rock rushing through the cave directly impacts the process of the space in the rock getting bigger."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The elephant was asked to recall a number mentioned earlier, why was it asked this? Options: A. breathe B. experience sadness C. forget nothing D. remember everything E. to get food Answer:","completion":"Given the options, the most likely answer to why an elephant was asked to recall a number would be D. \\"remember everything\\". Elephants have long been known and studied for their impressive memory skills. In the wild, this trait is crucial for their survival. They need to remember the locations of distant watering holes, the paths to significant food sources, relationships within the troop, and more. Elephants can hold onto these memories for many years, even a majority of their lives, which allows them to adapt to environmental changes, such as fluctuations in food and water supply, which can be seasonal or long-term. However, the example you gave of an elephant recalling a number implies a context more in line with trained elephants or those in captive care situations such as zoos or sanctuaries. Many animal intelligence studies involve training animals to recall items or sequences to measure their memory capacity, cognitive abilities, and sometimes depth of understanding of language or representations of concepts. This could be as simple as teaching an elephant to tap a specific numbered object, or as complex as responding to a verbal or pictorial cue identifying a number. The training often uses positive reinforcement techniques, meaning a food reward, physical affection, or a desired object or activity is provided when the elephant successfully completes the task. In either context, the elephant’s memory, in particular its capacity for long-term recall, is a central aspect of its survival, social structures, and interactions with humans. This extensive memory capacity is so frequently referenced in popular culture that phrases like \\"elephants never forget\\" have become common idioms in languages around the world. That's why out of the options given, it is deduced that an elephant was asked to recall a number to test or make use of its well-known ability to \\"remember everything\\". Remembering a number is not associated with the other options such as breathing, experiencing sadness, forgetting nothing, and getting food directly, and hence they can be ruled out."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Now, I have a new situation: Planet Neptune is not only very cold but also farther from the Sun than the Earth. In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Answer this question please: Would Neptune have slower or faster speed than Earth? A:","completion":"Neptune would have a slower speed than Earth. This is because the distance of a planet from its star affects its orbital speed. The farther a planet is from its star, the longer the distance it must travel within its orbit, and the slower its speed due to lesser gravitational influence from the star. In the case of Neptune and Earth, Neptune is much farther from the Sun (approximately 30 astronomical units (AU) away) compared to Earth's distance from the Sun (1 AU). Consequently, Neptune's orbital speed is slower than that of Earth. Additionally, Neptune's sidereal period or year (time taken to complete one orbit around the Sun) is approximately 165 Earth years, while Earth takes 1 Earth year to complete its orbit. This further establishes that Neptune's orbital speed is slower than Earth's."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Process: - A machine called a pulverizer grinds the coal into a fine powder - The coal powder mixes with hot air, which helps the coal burn more efficiently, and the mixture moves to the furnace - The burning coal heats water in a boiler, creating steam - Steam released from the boiler powers an engine called a turbine, transforming heat energy from burning coal into mechanical energy that spins the turbine engine - The spinning turbine is used to power a generator, a machine that turns mechanical energy into electric energy - This happens when magnets inside a copper coil in the generator spin - A condenser cools the steam moving through the turbine - As the steam is condensed, it turns back into water - The water returns to the boiler, and the cycle begins again - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose when there are more rain storms happens, how will it affect If power doesnt reach the pulverizer. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The user-provided hypothesis is actually a conjecture of two potential perturbations: 1. An increase in frequency of rain storms occurring. 2. A situation where power doesn't reach the pulverizer. Analyzing each scenario first, before combining both: 1. An increase in rain storms, on its own, doesn't directly change or disrupt our process unless the storms cause damage to the infrastructure, leading to power outages or interruptions in coal supply etc. These effects though are mostly indirect and are mitigations that the power plant would typically account for during their operations. 2. The pulverizer not receiving power is a more direct interruption of the operation process. The pulverizer is crucial in the first step, which grinds coal into a fine powder. This coal powder is then used for the burning process. If the pulverizer doesn't receive power, it means the coal won't be ground, thus it will be inefficient to burn, leading to a decrease in the heat produced. A reduction of heat would mean less steam, resulting in a decrease of mechanical energy produced by the turbine, which would finally result in less electrical energy generated by the generator. Combining both scenarios: If there are more rainstorms leading to a situation where power doesn't reach the pulverizer, it will have a significant impact on the process. The power interruption to the pulverizer could disrupt the grinding of coal, which would directly affect the creation of steam and subsequently the generation of electricity. Meanwhile, the rainstorms may not necessarily have a direct impact on the process, unless it causes some sort of damage or interruption, combining it with the power outage to the pulverizer would likely amplify the impact. In conclusion, the supposed combined perturbation could have an indirect and direct effect on the process, primarily depending on the severity of the power interruption and the rainstorms. Generally, power plants have contingency measures in place to handle such situations, but it would undoubtedly cause some level of disturbance to the process."},{"prompt":"- Steam is produced under pressure - Flows into a turbine - The turbine spins - Creates electricity.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is true given the truth of the first sentence, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of both sentences. Step 1: Understand the meaning of both sentences - Sentence 1: \\"Let's leave it till then.\\" This sentence suggests that there is something that needs to be left until a specific time or event in the future. - Sentence 2: \\"Quick! Take it with you.\\" This sentence is an urgent request to take something with you, implying action in the present moment. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the sentences Since Sentence 1 refers to leaving something until a specific time or event, while Sentence 2 requests for taking it immediately, these sentences seem to convey opposite or conflicting actions. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence can be true if the first sentence is true Given that the two sentences convey opposite actions, it seems unlikely that the second sentence can be true if the first sentence is true. The first sentence is asking to wait before taking any action, while the second sentence demands immediate action.

Remy found an extra blanket in the ottoman and covered Alex up with it. Given the context: How will Alex's body respond to this? The answer is:","completion":"When Remy covers Alex with an extra blanket, Alex's body will respond in several ways to adapt to the increase in warmth provided by the additional layer. These physiological responses aim to maintain a stable core body temperature, a process known as thermoregulation. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Alex's body will respond: 1. Detection of the temperature change: Thermoreceptors in Alex's skin and the hypothalamus in their brain will detect the increase in temperature caused by the extra blanket. 2. Activation of the hypothalamus: Upon detecting the temperature change, the hypothalamus will initiate appropriate physiological responses to maintain the body's core temperature. 3. Vasodilation: One of the first responses is vasodilation, which occurs when blood vessels near the surface of the skin expand or dilate. This process allows for increased blood flow to the skin, helping to dissipate the excess heat through the skin and out into the environment, preventing overheating. 4. Reduced rate of shivering: As Alex's body warms up due to the extra blanket, the intensity and frequency of shivering will decrease. Shivering is an involuntary muscle contraction that generates heat when the body is cold. Since the blanket is providing warmth, Alex's body will not need to produce as much heat by shivering. 5. Adjusting the metabolic rate: The body’s metabolic rate may also adapt in response to the warmth from the additional blanket. If Alex's body temperature increases, the hypothalamus can decrease the metabolic rate, reducing heat production within the body. 6. Relaxation of the arrector pili muscles: These small muscles, attached to hair follicles on the skin, contract when the body is cold, causing the hairs to stand on end (also known as goosebumps). This reaction helps to create a layer of trapped air that insulates the skin from the cold. With the extra warmth from the blanket, these muscles will relax, allowing the hairs to lie flat against the skin again. Overall, as a result of these physiological responses, Alex's body will gradually find a balance in maintaining their core temperature and comfort levels, reducing shivering and ensuring a more restful sleep."},{"prompt":"Question: Answer the question below: When a child has a lot of energy they will move around slower or faster?

The process consists of an organized thunderstorm activity transforming into a tropical cyclone, then a tropical depression, followed by a tropical storm, and finally forming a clearly defined eye to become a hurricane. The pressure in the storm's center plays a crucial role in determining the intensity of the hurricane. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, and its presence in the atmosphere leads to an increase in the Earth's temperature, which ultimately impacts the climate. Higher levels of greenhouse gases lead to warmer ocean temperatures, which provide the necessary energy for hurricanes to develop and intensify. The relationship between atmospheric pressure and carbon dioxide levels is related to their potential influence on weather events, particularly with hurricanes. Suppose there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which leads to cooler temperatures overall. In that case, it can result in lower ocean temperatures, creating an environment less conducive to hurricane formation and development. Due to the lessened energy from cooler ocean waters, the pressure in the storm's center would likely drop less compared to those conditions with higher carbon dioxide levels and warmer ocean temperatures. Therefore, if there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it will potentially affect the pressure in the center of these storm systems by causing it to drop less. This may, in turn, lead to less intense hurricanes or even reducing the likelihood of hurricane formation. However, it is important to note that various other factors, such as atmospheric circulation and wind shear, also play a role in hurricane development, and reducing carbon dioxide levels may not necessarily eliminate hurricanes entirely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the following question: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long did it take for Chihuly to create the sculpture suspended over the V&A museum?

Leyte Gulf featured the largest battleships ever built, was the last time in history that battleships engaged each other, and was also notable as the first time that kamikaze aircraft were used. Allied victory in the Philippine Sea established Allied air and sea superiority in the western Pacific. Nimitz favored blockading the Philippines and landing on Formosa. This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte.

I can use this background: Start right above point on the temperature axis and follow the red line vertically. At very low pressure, the particles of the substance are far apart from one another and the substance is in the gas state. As the pressure is increased, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. Eventually the particles are pushed so close together that attractive forces cause the substance to condense into the liquid state. Continually increasing the pressure on the liquid will eventually cause the substance to solidify. For the majority of substances, the solid state is denser than the liquid state and so putting a liquid under great pressure will cause it to turn into a solid. The line segment represents the process of sublimation, where the substance changes directly from a solid to a gas. At a sufficiently low pressure, the liquid phase does not exist. The point labeled is called the triple point . The triple point is the one condition of temperature and pressure where the solid, liquid, and vapor states of a substance can all coexist at equilibrium. Now, I have a new situation: Dan is conducting a research to see how a substance behaves in varying pressure. First, he selects a gaseous substance in very low pressure. He calls it as case A. Then he increases the pressure. He calls it case B. Finally, he increases the pressure even further. He calls it case C. Answer this question please: Which case would most likely see the substance turning into liquid, case B or case C? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, case B would most likely see the substance turning into a liquid. This is because, as the pressure is increased from the initial very low pressure in case A, the particles of the substance are forced closer and closer together. This causes the attractive forces between the particles to become more significant, which can lead to the gas condensing into a liquid state. In case B, the pressure is increased just enough to push the particles close enough for the attractive forces to create a liquid. In this scenario, we are likely at or near a phase transition point between the gaseous and liquid states. In case C, however, the pressure is increased even further which suggests that the substance may have already transitioned into a liquid in case B. Increasing the pressure further could cause the substance to eventually solidify (as mentioned in the background information), or it could simply be a situation with an increased pressure on the liquid without turning it into a solid. This depends on the specific properties of the substance and the pressure applied. Therefore, case B is the most likely scenario in which the substance would turn into a liquid, as the pressure has been increased just enough to allow the attractive forces between particles to act and condense the gas into a liquid state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Chinese people both in the country and abroad have contacted the BBC with their reactions to the latest developments. I am a senior high school student from China. I think it's a good news for most of us. At primary school most of my classmates - including me - were only children and many of us wanted to have a sibling. My cousin was a second child, and my aunt and uncle were heavily fined. But I think the one-child policy was quite effective and benefited China in the past few decades. In my grandparents' generation, they usually had big families with around five to 10 kids, some might be more than that. Nowadays most of the people in China would prefer to have between one and three kids - except for some rural areas. Because of the cost of living and raising a child is higher than before, people would not want to have too many kids. So I think it's the right time to change this policy. I'm a supporter of the one-child policy but now our country has an ageing population problem. At the same time, our population is still quite large. It's a really difficult decision. Great news! I am a Chinese national married to an English man. I am an only child myself. My parents loved kids but they could only have me because of the threat of losing their jobs if they had more. I felt lonely growing up by myself. My parents tried their best by having my cousins over and sending me to my cousins for a day but I always wished I had sisters and brothers. Now my parents are over 50 and my grandparents are living with them. I want to be able to help my parents too but it will be hard to make them move all the way to the UK and give up their life and friends in China. My husband is very understanding of the Chinese culture and we are working hard now to save money to begin our own family. If we are blessed, I will definitely have more than one child. This is a good news for us. My husband and I have not had a baby even though we are already over 30. We are considering having babies abroad rather than in China. Anyway, it is good news, especially for couples like us. It's good news to me - a middle school teacher - who has always dreamed of having a second child. I'm a college student from China. I'm an only child and my parents will not have another child. This is because they are in their fifties and the cost of raising a child is too high. This is a highly anticipated result. The one-child policy is unpopular in rural areas where preference to a male child is widespread. This should be abolished. I am glad to hear the news. This is good news for me and many city dwellers. I have been considering a second child for years but haven't been able to because of the policy restriction. Now the obstacle is removed, it's time to carry on. Both of my children were born in China to a Chinese mother. My son was given his citizenship documents - but it wasn't so straightforward for baby number two. According to the one-child policy, she could not get the same documents. This meant she would not be able to attend a state school or move easily from city to city. Luckily, as the child of a British expat she got British citizenship and so could attend an international school. I have seen how parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents all dote on a single child. Not only is there enormous pressure on these only children to do well in their school exams, but according to tradition they are also expected to look after their parents when they grow old. So a two-child policy seems to me a perfect compromise. It still aims to keep the population at a stable size, but now the next generation will grow up with a playmate to share with (and fight with!). \\"This policy can only satisfy the super rich and super poor,\\" because \\"the rich do not worry [financially] about raising more than one child\\" and \\"the poor have more children to carry out labour\\". \\"I am grateful to the party for liberalizing the two-child policy; I can finally have a little sister.\\" Produced by Dhruti Shah and BBC Monitoring's Kerry Allen","completion":"Chinese people share their opinions on the government changing the one-child policy, with many supporting the change due to their desire for siblings, the need to address the aging population issue, and the challenges caused by the previous policy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It offers an experience of ancient Greek and Roman art in a setting that replicates that in which it would originally have been displayed, a Roman villa of the first century AD. On April 18, after three years of work, the galleries of the Villa reopen with an entirely new arrangement of the collection, one that situates art in its cultural and historical context. Since 2006, when the Getty Villa opened as a museum dedicated to the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, the collection has been presented along thematic lines, with galleries dedicated to subjects such as ancient theater, athletes and competition, and gods and goddesses. This approach was useful in illuminating social life in the ancient classical world, but it prioritized objects’ subject matter over their stature as works of art and removed them from their broader artistic and cultural context. Reenvisioning how the antiquities were displayed at the Villa was one of my top priorities when I joined the J. Paul Getty Museum as director in 2012. As a specialist in ancient art, my priority is to help visitors to see these great treasures as beautiful and fascinating works of art, and sparking their curiosity to understand them in the context of their place in human culture. Starting April 18 our Villa galleries offer a new journey through ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan art. The visitor’s path begins on the first-floor rooms devoted to Neolithic and Bronze Age (Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean) Greek art. The journey continues through the Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, when the Greeks developed the first fully naturalistic vision of the human figure. And it culminates in the dramatic skylit halls of ancient Roman sculpture. In all there are 33 spaces on two floors, with 3,000 more square feet of gallery space than before. The visitor’s path winds through the galleries, gardens, and fountains, offering views onto the spectacular landscape and Pacific Ocean. Question: When does the visitor see Neolithic art?

The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers.

Read this: The new government drafted and implemented a constitution in 1923 based on a parliamentary system. Saad Zaghlul was popularly elected as Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. In 1936, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was concluded. Continued instability due to remaining British influence and increasing political involvement by the king led to the dissolution of the parliament in a military coup d'état known as the 1952 Revolution. The Free Officers Movement forced King Farouk to abdicate in support of his son Fuad. British military presence in Egypt lasted until 1954.

I have a new situation: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present. But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. What is an answer for this question: Who will have more restricted blood flow through their arteries? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Jake will have more restricted blood flow through his arteries. Step 1: Understanding the issue Atherosclerosis is a disorder in which cholesterol and other materials build up on the interior of the arterial wall, leading to the formation of plaques. Step 2: Comparing Jake and Ryan During the physical examination, the doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall, while Ryan had none. Step 3: Linking plaques to blood flow The presence of plaques in the arteries can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: I have seen most, if not all of the Laurel & Hardy classic films. I have always enjoyed there comical stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. This new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both Laurel & Hardy, however fails miserably for various reasons. One of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayed in the 90's setting. Some of the former dialogue was brought back, however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series. This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation 673 * r = 1127 * r + 1816 for 'r', we will first simplify the equation and then isolate 'r' on one side of the equation. Step 1: Move all terms containing 'r' to one side of the equation. We have 673 * r on the left side, and 1127 * r on the right side. To move the 1127 * r to the left side, we subtract it from both sides of the equation: 673 * r - 1127 * r = 1127 * r - 1127 * r + 1816 Simplifying, we get: (673 - 1127) * r = 1816 Step 2: Simplify the expression. We now calculate the difference between the coefficients of 'r': -454 * r = 1816 Step 3: Isolate 'r' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient. To isolate 'r', we need to divide both sides of the equation by -454: (-454 * r) / (-454) = 1816 / (-454) Simplifying, we get: r = -4 Thus, the solution to the given equation is r = -4."},{"prompt":"Question: Question: A post office is always located in what kind of structure?

During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell lines of the embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilized egg cell, the zygote, gives rise to the many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What process causes changes in plant cells?","completion":"Sure, I can explain it like this: Imagine you're playing with a big box of building blocks. At first, all the blocks are the same; they’re just blocks. That's like the very first cell that starts every plant or animal - it's called a zygote. But as you start building, you decide some blocks are going to be part of a house, some are going to be part of a tree, and some are going to be the people, right? Just like that, as the zygote starts to divide in a growing plant, the cells decide to become different things. Some become leaf cells, some become stem cells, and some become flower cells. This is what we call cellular differentiation, and it's caused by a process called epigenetics. Epigenetics is like a tiny switch on each building block (or gene) that decides what that block is going to be. If the switch is turned one way, the cell could become a leaf. If it's turned another way, the cell could become a stem. This is how a single, starting cell - the zygote - can result in so many different types of cells in a plant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Question: what are stocks and bonds I found the following answer on Google: Bonds and stocks are both securities , but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in the company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (i.e. they are lenders). Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the answer found on Google provides a correct, simplified explanation of the difference between stocks and bonds. However, to give you a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the two, let's delve deeper into the topic. Stocks, also known as equities, are a type of financial instrument that represents ownership in a company or corporation. When an investor purchases stock in a company, they become a shareholder and acquire part ownership in that company. Ownership is represented by the number of shares a person possesses. Companies issue stocks to raise capital, allowing them to fund their operations or invest in growth opportunities. As a shareholder, an investor is entitled to certain rights, such as voting on key decisions and receiving dividends (a portion of the company's profits, which may be distributed to shareholders). The value of a company's stock can fluctuate depending on various economic factors, news, financial performance, and market sentiment. When stock prices increase, investors can potentially earn profits by selling their shares at a higher price than the original purchase. Bonds, on the other hand, are debt securities issued by corporations, governments, and other entities to raise capital. When an investor purchases a bond, they essentially lend money to the issuer for a predetermined period, known as the bond's term or maturity. In return for this loan, the bond issuer pays the investor periodic interest payments, known as coupon payments. At the end of the bond's term, the issuer repays the principal amount (also called the face value) to the bondholder. The bond market is generally considered less volatile than the stock market, as bonds are considered relatively safe investments compared to stocks. This is because bonds are considered debt obligations, and the bondholders must be paid before shareholders in the event of bankruptcy. However, the potential returns on bonds are typically lower than those of stocks, reflecting a trade-off between risk and reward. In summary, stocks and bonds are different types of securities that serve different purposes in an investment portfolio. Stocks represent ownership in a company and carry potential for significant gains but also higher risks. Bonds are fixed-income investments representing debt obligations, offering lower risk and more stable returns. Investors often diversify their portfolios by holding a mix of both stocks and bonds in order to achieve a balance of risk and reward that aligns with their investment objectives and risk tolerance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Carl Dean Switzer (August 8, 1927 - January 21, 1959) was an American singer, child actor, breeder and guide. Switzer began his career as a child actor in the mid-1930s appearing in the Our Gang short subjects series as Alfalfa, one of the series' most popular and best-remembered characters. After leaving the series in 1940, Switzer struggled to find substantial roles owing to typecasting. As an adult, he appeared mainly in bit parts and B-movies. Switzer's tenure on Our Gang ended in 1940, when he was twelve. His first role after leaving the series was as co-star in the 1941 comedy Reg'lar Fellers. The next year, he had a supporting role in Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch. Switzer continued to appear in films in various supporting roles, including in Johnny Doughboy (1942), Going My Way (1944), and The Great Mike (1944). Switzer had an uncredited role as Auggie in the 1943 film The Human Comedy. Switzer's last starring roles were in a brief series of imitation Bowery Boys movies. He reprised his \\"Alfalfa\\" character, complete with comically sour vocals, in PRC's Gas House Kids comedies in 1946 and 1947. By this time Switzer was downplaying his earlier Our Gang work. In his 1946 resume, he referred to the films generically as \\"M-G-M short product.\\" Switzer had small parts in both the 1946 Christmas film It's a Wonderful Life as Mary Hatch's (Donna Reed) date at a high school dance in the film's beginning and again in the 1948 film On Our Merry Way as the mayor's son, a trumpet player in a fixed musical talent contest. In the 1954 musical film White Christmas, his photo was used to depict \\"Freckle-Faced Haynes,\\" an army buddy of lead characters Wallace and Davis (played by Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye) who was also the brother of the female leads the Haynes Sisters (played by Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen). In the 1950s, Switzer turned to television. Between 1952 and 1955, he made six appearances on The Roy Rogers Show. He also guest-starred in an episode of the American science fiction anthology series Science Fiction Theatre and The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. In 1953 and 1954, Switzer co-starred in three William A. Wellman-directed films: Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty, both starring John Wayne, and Track of the Cat, starring Robert Mitchum. In 1956, he co-starred in The Bowery Boys film Dig That Uranium followed by a bit part as a Hebrew slave in Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments. Switzer's final film role was in the film drama The Defiant Ones. Besides acting, Switzer bred and trained hunting dogs and guided hunting expeditions. Among his notable clients were Roy Rogers and Dale Evans (Switzer's son's godparents), James Stewart, and Henry Fonda. Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"One interesting aspect from this article is that, besides acting, Carl Dean Switzer also had a career as a breeder and trainer of hunting dogs, as well as a guide for hunting expeditions.

Technical professionals dislike management jargon, which they consider superficial and dishonest.

Assuming the original sentence is trying to say \\"Even so ... as I hear a woman so drunk that she started to cry and speak for herself.\\", the steps in translating this to German would be as follows: 1.

Question: suppose more sugar is eaten happens, how will it affect The amount of oxygen is decreased. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"Sugar consumption does not directly affect the amount of oxygen in the human body. The process of breathing, through which oxygen is taken into the lungs, and respiration at the cellular level, where oxygen is used to burn glucose and produce energy, are not influenced by the intake of sugar in the short term. Breathing is a mechanical process driven by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, and it is primarily controlled by the levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, rather than glucose. High sugar intake won't change how much oxygen is inhaled. On a cellular level, while it is true that glucose (which is derived from consumed sugars) is used by the cells in conjunction with oxygen to create energy, water, and carbon dioxide (in a process known as cellular respiration), increased sugar consumption doesn't necessarily mean that more oxygen is required. The body has specific energy needs, and consuming more sugar than needed leads to it being stored as fat, rather than increasing the rate of cellular respiration or the demand for oxygen. However, constant high sugar intake over time can lead to conditions like obesity and diabetes, which can impact the efficiency of your bodily functions, including oxygen supply and usage. These conditions can lead to shortness of breath or trouble breathing, but this is a secondary effect, not a direct one made by sugar on oxygen levels. So, the direct answer to your question will be (C: no effect).

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Six Chinese surveillance ships have entered waters near islands claimed by both China and Japan. China said the ships were carrying out \\"law enforcement\\" to demonstrate its jurisdiction over the islands, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. At least two of the vessels left after the Japanese coast guard issued a warning, Japanese officials say. The move came after Japan sealed a deal to buy three of the islands from their private Japanese owner. Japan controls the uninhabited but resource-rich East China Sea islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan. The Japanese Coast Guard said the first two Chinese boats entered Japan's territorial waters at 06:18 local time (21:18 GMT Thursday), followed by another fleet of four other ships just after 07:00. The first two ships then left the area. A third ship left later on Friday morning, one report said. No force was used, Japanese officials added. \\"Our patrol vessels are currently telling them to leave our country's territorial waters,\\" the coastguard said in a statement. The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that its ships were there. \\"These law enforcement and patrol activities are aimed to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islets and ensure the country's maritime interests,\\" a statement said. The US has called for ''cooler heads to prevail'' as tension intensifies between China and Japan over the islands, which lie south of Okinawa and north of Taiwan. US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is due to visit both Japan and China from this weekend as part of a tour of the region that also includes New Zealand. The dispute has seriously marred diplomatic relations between China and Japan and threatens to damage the strong trading relationship, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing. The row has also generated strong nationalist sentiment on both sides that observers say now makes it very difficult to be seen to be backing down, says our correspondent.

Question: what are square diamonds called? I found the following answer on Google: The ability to retain more crystal weight makes this shape popular amongst diamond cutters. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no.","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not directly answer your question about what square diamonds are called. While it is true that retaining more crystal weight is beneficial to diamond cutters, that information does not provide a specific name for square diamonds. Square-shaped diamonds are often called \\"princess cut\\" diamonds. The princess cut is a popular and well-known diamond shape for engagement rings and other types of jewelry. It is characterized by its square shape, with sharp, distinct corners that give it a symmetrical and modern appearance. This particular cut is known for its brilliance, as it allows light to reflect and refract within the diamond more effectively than some other shapes, creating a dazzling sparkle. Aside from the princess cut, there are other square or square-like diamond shapes, such as the \\"cushion cut,\\" which has rounded corners and larger facets, giving it a slightly softer appearance, and the \\"Asscher cut,\\" which has a square shape with cropped corners, giving it an octagonal outline. The Radiant cut is another square-shaped diamond, but it features trimmed corners and a more complex facet pattern that combines the brilliance of the round and emerald cuts. Each of these square diamond cuts has its unique characteristics, and the choice between them often comes down to personal preference about style, facet patterns, and overall appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Abstract: Leprosy enables investigation of mechanisms by which the innate immune system contributes to host defense against infection, because in one form, the disease progresses, and in the other, the infection is limited. We report that Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation of human monocytes induces rapid differentiation into two distinct subsets: DC-SIGN+ CD16+ macrophages and CD1b+ DC-SIGN− dendritic cells. DC-SIGN+ phagocytic macrophages were expanded by TLR-mediated upregulation of interleukin (IL)-15 and IL-15 receptor. CD1b+ dendritic cells were expanded by TLR-mediated upregulation of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and its receptor, promoted T cell activation and secreted proinflammatory cytokines. Whereas DC-SIGN+ macrophages were detected in lesions and after TLR activation in all leprosy patients, CD1b+ dendritic cells were not detected in lesions or after TLR activation of peripheral monocytes in individuals with the progressive lepromatous form, except during reversal reactions in which bacilli were cleared by T helper type 1 (TH1) responses. In tuberculoid lepromatous lesions, DC-SIGN+ cells were positive for macrophage markers, but negative for dendritic cell markers. Thus, TLR-induced differentiation of monocytes into either macrophages or dendritic cells seems to crucially influence effective host defenses in human infectious disease..

Jeffrey found it easier to stay employed than Nelson because OPTIONS: A). Jeffrey had a strong work ethic.. B). Nelson had a strong work ethic..","completion":"Jeffrey found it easier to stay employed than Nelson because Jeffrey had a strong work ethic. This work ethic manifested itself in various ways that ultimately made Jeffrey a more reliable and valuable employee than Nelson. Step 1: Consider Jeffrey's work ethic: Jeffrey consistently demonstrated discipline, dedication, and a passion for his work. His commitment to excellence made it natural for him to go above and beyond the call of duty whenever necessary. Step 2: Compare Jeffrey's work ethic to Nelson's: While Nelson may have had a solid work ethic, it didn't quite match the level of commitment that Jeffrey displayed. Nelson might have been less consistent in meeting deadlines, following through with his tasks, or staying focused at work. Step 3: Explain the impact of their work ethics on their employment status: Given their respective work ethics, Jeffrey proved to be a more valuable asset to the company. His dedication and professionalism led to greater satisfaction among his colleagues, supervisors, and clients. This, in turn, made it easier for him to not only remain employed but also to advance in his career. Step 4: Examine possible consequences for Nelson: On the other hand, Nelson's weaker work ethic might have eventually caught up with him, leading to negative feedback from his superiors or teammates. This could have influenced any decisions made regarding his employment, making it more difficult for him to retain his job or move up within the company. In conclusion, Jeffrey's strong work ethic was the primary reason why he found it easier to stay employed than Nelson. His commitment to excellence, discipline, and motivation set him apart as an exemplary employee, leading to increased job security and opportunities for advancement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In recent years, a growing body of research has shown that our appetite and food intake are influenced by a large number of factors besides our biological need for energy, including our eating environment and our perception of the food in front of us. Studies have shown. for instance. that eating in front of the TV (or a similar distraction) can increase both hunger and the amount of food consumed. Even simple visual cues( ). like plate size and lighting, have been shown to affect portion size and consumption. A new study suggested that our shot-term memory also may play a role in appetite. Several hours after a meal, people's hunger levels were predicted not by how much they'd eaten but rather by how much food they'd seen in front of them --- in other words, how much they remembered eating. This difference suggests the memory of our previous meal may have a bigger influence on our appetite than the actual size of the meal. says Jeffrey M . Brunstrom , a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Bristol. \\"Hunger isn't. controlled solely by the physical characteristics of a recent meal. We have identified an independent role for memory for that meal.\\" Brunstrom says. \\"This shows that the relationship between hunger and food intake is more complex than we thought.\\" These findings echo earlier research that suggests our perception of food can sometimes trick our body's response to the food itself. In a 2011 study, for instance, people who drank the same 380-calorie milkshake on two separate occasions produced different levels of hunger-related hormones, depending on whether the shake's label said it contained 620 0r 140 calories. Moreover, the participants reported feeling more full when they thought they'd consumed a higher-calorie shake. What does this means for our eating habits? Although it hardly seems practical to trick ourselves in to eating less, the new findings do highlight the benefits of focusing on our food avoiding TV and multitasking while eating. ...

Administratively, the territory of Kresy was composed of voivodeships of Lwów, Nowogródek, Polesie, Stanisawów, Tarnopol, Wilno, Woy, and the Biaystok. Today, these territories are divided between Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, and south-eastern Lithuania, with such major cities as Lviv, Vilnius, and Hrodna no longer in Poland. In the Second Polish Republic the term \\"Kresy\\" roughly equated with the lands beyond the so-called Curzon Line, which was suggested after World War I in December 1919 by the British Foreign Office as the eastern border of the re-emerging sovereign Republic following the century of partitions.

Between March and August 1939, Poland also shared a border with the then-Hungarian governorate of Subcarpathia. Despite internal and external pressures, it continued to exist until 1939, when Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and the Slovak Republic, marking the beginning of World War II in Europe.

It began with a small guard unit known as the \\"Saal-Schutz\\" (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, Heinrich Himmler joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (192945), it grew from a small paramilitary formation to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe. - Operation Barbarossa (German: \\"Unternehmen Barbarossa\\") was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which was launched on Sunday 22 June 1941.

The \\"Einsatzgruppen\\" were involved in the murder of much of the intelligentsia and cultural elite of Poland, and had an integral role in the implementation of the so-called Final solution to the Jewish question (\\"Die Endlösung der Judenfrage\\") in territories conquered by Nazi Germany. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians, beginning with the intelligentsia and swiftly progressing to Soviet political commissars, Jews, and Gypsies throughout Eastern Europe. - Sicherheitsdienst (\\"Security Service\\"), full title Sicherheitsdienst des Reichsführers-SS, or SD, was the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany. The organization was the first Nazi Party intelligence organization to be established and was considered a sister organization with the Gestapo, which the SS had infiltrated heavily after 1934. Between 1933 and 1939, the SD was administered as an independent SS office, after which it was transferred to the authority of the Reich Main Security Office (\\"Reichssicherheitshauptamt\\"; RSHA), as one of its seven departments/offices.

The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Nazi Germany established the Reichskommissariat Ostland (RKO) in 1941 as the civilian occupation regime in the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), the northeastern part of Poland and the west part of the Belarusian SSR during World War II. It was also known initially as Reichskommissariat Baltenland (\\"Baltic Land\\"). The political organization for this territory after an initial period of military administration before its establishment was that of a German civilian administration, nominally under the authority of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories led by Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg, but actually controlled by the Nazi official Hinrich Lohse, its appointed Reichskommissar. - The National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated NSDAP), commonly referred to in English as the Nazi Party, was a political party in Germany that was active between 1920 and 1945 and practised the ideology of Nazism.

Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin. - The Baltic states, also known as the Baltic countries, Baltic republics, Baltic nations, or simply, the Baltics, are the three countries in northern Europe on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Baltic states cooperate on a regional level in several intergovernmental organizations. - Belarus ( lat. ', ), officially the Republic of Belarus, formerly known by its Russian name Byelorussia (though this name is no longer used in Belarus itself, even in Russian language), is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Russia to the northeast, Ukraine to the south, Poland to the west, and Lithuania and Latvia to the northwest. Its capital and most populous city is Minsk. Over 40% of its is forested. Its strongest economic sectors are service industries and manufacturing.

There is no consensus on the precise area it covers, partly because the term has a wide range of geopolitical, geographical, cultural, and socioeconomic connotations. There are \\"almost as many definitions of Eastern Europe as there are scholars of the region\\". A related United Nations paper adds that \\"every assessment of spatial identities is essentially a social and cultural construct\\". - The Sicherheitspolizei, often abbreviated as SiPo, was a term used in Germany for security police. In the Nazi era, it was used to describe the state political and criminal investigation security agencies. It was made up by the combined forces of the Gestapo (secret state police) and the Kripo (criminal police) between 1936 and 1939. As a formal agency, the SiPo was folded into the RSHA in 1939, but the term continued to be used informally until the end of World War II in Europe. - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict.

The attack occurred Wednesday night as the women were walking unaccompanied along a street, said police Cmdr. Muccadam Khamis. The attackers, who did not take anything from their victims, left the scene on the motorbike, he said. Eyewitnesses said the acid was splashed on the women's faces, chests and hands. The government condemned the attack and vowed to find the perpetrators. \\"The event is a great tragedy, and an attack of this nature against a foreign citizen, has never happened here before,\\" the Zanzibar government said in a statement. \\"The government is appealing to the general public to assist in the arrest of the offenders and is offering a reward of 10 million shillings (about 6,000) to anyone providing information leading to an arrest,\\" the statement continued. The government also said it would regulate the purchase of acid and other related products, and warned that such attacks could seriously damage the island's tourism industry, one of its main sources of funds. Police patrols will be stepped up in major tourist spots, officials promised.

Leader - NYTimes.com Mr. Cox, left, who supported another candidate, Steve Levy, early in the Republican primary campaign, was once a target of Mr. Paladino’s outlandish advertising machine. Mr. Paladino’s campaign put out a flier depicting an altered “Titanic” movie poster with Mr. Cox holding Mr. Levy in his arms. The caption: “Just close your eyes, Steve. They’re only icebergs.” That was the primary. This is the general election. “Somebody had a birthday and didn’t tell us about it!” Mr. Paladino said in a mocking tone at a country club dinner in Orleans County. He then led the group in singing “Happy Birthday, Chairman Cox.” (“That guy can sing — how about that!” one party official said.) Mr. Cox approached the podium, smiled widely, and the two blew out the candles on his cake. “This guy said to me before the primary, ‘You win, Carl, and I’m with you 1,000 percent,’ ” Mr. Paladino said. “He’s kept his word.” Thomas P. DiNapoli, the state comptroller, was not exactly thrilled last month when his Republican challenger, Harry Wilson, released an advertisement attacking him as being “under investigation” in connection with a corruption scandal involving his predecessor, Alan G. Hevesi. On Friday, one day after Mr. Hevesi pleaded guilty to a felony and Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo declared that Mr. DiNapoli, above, was not the subject of any investigation, the DiNapoli campaign fired off a letter to television stations, demanding that Mr. Wilson take down the advertisement. “Wilson’s ads erroneously allege that Comptroller DiNapoli is ‘under investigation,’ ” wrote Mr. DiNapoli’s campaign manager, Mark Benoit. “As you are aware, your station has a responsibility to air only truthful ads and may be liable for those that are false and defamatory.” It may well be that the DiNapoli campaign was less concerned about the advertisement itself and more about underscoring his status as someone who was not the subject of the inquiry. Repeat, not under investigation! After all, Mr. Wilson’s advertisement first ran in July and, at 18 seconds, is shorter than most spots. By late Friday, the Wilson campaign promised to pull it. “The ad, which was 100 percent accurate when made, is being swapped out,” said William F. B. O’Reilly, a campaign spokesman. “We’ll likely replace the investigation language with his 200 tax hike votes.” DAVID W. CHEN Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has charmed New Yorkers with his borscht-belt brand of humor, peppering press conferences with cranky wisecracks and Catskills-worthy puns. Now he is taking his act national. Fresh off a pair of talk-show appearances where he parried with Jon Stewart and David Letterman, Mr. Bloomberg on Thursday taped the NPR quiz show “Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me...,” submitting to a series of brain-teaser questions in front of a sold-out audience at Carnegie Hall. “You’re thinking ... fourth term,” the show’s host, Peter Sagal, suggested to the mayor. “I’m actually thinking, ‘Dinner,’ ” Mr. Bloomberg replied. Mr. Sagal began with a few ribs about the three-term mayor’s reluctance to relinquish City Hall. “He loves New York City so much he has so far refused to give it back,” he said. Later, Mr. Sagal added, “You probably wouldn’t be interested in the presidency; he only gets two terms.” Lips pursed, the mayor smiled amiably at Mr. Sagal’s jokes and occasionally fired back. Asked about the 102 million price tag on his 2009 mayoral campaign, the most expensive in the city’s history, Mr. Bloomberg replied, “If I could have done it for less, I would have.” In a quiz titled “I’m your king, and I quit,” Mr. Bloomberg was asked questions about the life of Edward, Duke of Windsor, who abdicated the British throne in 1936: he got two out of three. In between, Mr. Sagal kept needling his guest. Of the Jewish mayor’s 101-year-old mother, he wondered: “You’re a billionaire, you’re the mayor of New York. Is she still vaguely disappointed in you?” The “Wait, Wait” episode is scheduled to be broadcast at 11 a.m. Saturday on WNYC-FM (93.9) and WNYC-AM (820). Asked about the mayor’s recent comedy kick, his spokesman, Stu Loeser, wrote in an e-mail: “They’re great invitations from great shows.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses various updates and events within different political campaigns during an unspecified election period.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

The project's aim was to create a revolutionary device called the Bannion Gamma Transponder that could cure him of his peculiar ability – one that made him transform into a formidable creature better known as Hulk. This astonishing Hulk persona was triggered by intense anger or stress, which would in turn make Dr. Banner lose all control over his actions. The Joshua-Lambert Research Institute, a privately funded organization, was dedicated to finding ways of improving human potential, as well as developing new medical technologies and treatments. One of the latest advancements of the institute was the creation of a gamma transcending technology that could potentially cure human conditions caused by genetic alterations. This research not only sparked great interest around the world, but also caught the attention of a less benevolent group. Meanwhile, on a completely unrelated expedition in Norway, a highly regarded archaeologist named Blake was exploring the far reaches of the Norse wilderness, in search of ancient artifacts. As destiny often has a peculiar sense of humor, Blake stumbled upon an enchanted hammer of mythical origin. This unparalleled artifact, bearing secrets long lost to the streams of time, contained the soul of the Norse god of thunder, Thor. Upon taking possession of the hammer, Blake found himself imbued with the incredible powers of Thor, transforming him into an extraordinary being. The lives of these two extraordinary individuals – Dr. Banner and Blake – were about to unexpectedly intertwine. The aforementioned group, with malevolent intentions toward the Bannion Gamma Transponder, decided to take a direct approach to obtaining the remarkable device. In a bold move, the group orchestrated the kidnapping of Sadie Shaw, a prominent figure within the Joshua-Lambert Research Institute, who was well acquainted with Dr. Banner. The kidnappers, disguised as police officers, managed to successfully abduct Shaw, despite the valiant efforts of both Hulk and Thor, who had joined forces to rescue her. With Shaw's life hanging in the balance, Dr. Banner found himself cornered by the enigmatic mastermind behind the mysterious group – a cunning individual named LeBeau. LeBeau insisted on striking a deal with Dr. Banner: he would ensure the safe release of Sadie Shaw in exchange for the Bannion Gamma Transponder. Having little choice but to comply, Dr. Banner reluctantly agreed to LeBeau's terms. He handed over the Bannion Gamma Transponder, fearing the potential consequences of the device being weaponized by the malevolent organization. However, the scientist did not relent that easily. Along with the help of the Norse-powered Blake, now turned Thor, the two heroes decided that they would recover the device from the clutches of LeBeau and his dangerous group. Displaying incredible power and unyielding determination, Hulk and Thor embarked on an epic quest to hunt down LeBeau and his henchmen and retrieve the Bannion Gamma Transponder. The duo employed the full strength of their respective abilities to fight their enemies and protect humanity from impending doom. Through a series of fierce battles and daring confrontations with LeBeau's forces, the heroes' journey laid bare the darker sides of human ambition, power, and greed. As they fought relentlessly against the powerful organization, Dr. Banner and Blake, driven by the noble hope of saving Shaw and preventing the potential misuse of the Bannion Gamma Transponder, finally reached a climactic confrontation with LeBeau. With LeBeau's back against the wall, the truth about his intentions and the fate of the Bannion Gamma Transponder finally came to light. In the end, Hulk and Thor managed to spring Sadie Shaw from LeBeau's clutches, reclaim the Bannion Gamma Transponder, and bring those responsible to justice. Dr. Banner's achievements would go on to benefit humanity in ways unimaginable, with the fantastic duo's remarkable friendship standing as a testament to the age-old adage that no matter how great one's power, the real strength lies in unity and trust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the fact \\"wind and rain cause erosion\\", what is the answer to the question or completion \\"Imagine astronauts traveling to a distant asteroid as it passes near Earth. During their mission they leave behind boot prints. How long will these potentially last?\\" Options: A. several months; B. 5 years; C. thousands of years; D. 2 weeks;","completion":"First, let's analyze the given fact: \\"wind and rain cause erosion.\\" This implies that in presence of wind and rain, objects left behind (like footprints) will erode over time. Now let's think about the scenario: astronauts travel to a distant asteroid as it passes near Earth, and they leave behind boot prints. Step 1: Consider the environment on an asteroid An asteroid is an airless, dry, and rocky body. As a result, there is no weather system or wind, and no rainfall or other liquid source to cause erosion. Step 2: Compare the asteroid environment to Earth's The given fact on erosion applies to Earth's conditions, with wind and rain participating in the erosion process. Since an asteroid presents a vastly different scenario, we need to factor that in our reasoning. Step 3: Evaluate the options based on the environment A. Several months: This seems unlikely, as the lack of wind and rain on an asteroid makes erosion a slow process. B. 5 years: This option also seems too short, again due to the lack of erosion factors. C. Thousands of years: The absence of wind and rain on an asteroid suggests that anything left behind will remain untouched and undisturbed for an extended period. This option seems more plausible. D. 2 weeks: This is highly unlikely because the environmental factors that cause rapid erosion are not present. Based on the given information and analysis of the environment on an asteroid, I would choose option C. The astronauts' boot prints could potentially last thousands of years, due to the absence of wind and rain that typically contribute to erosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My father had brought me to this spot in a small town not far from our home in Rome. I wondered why. \\"Look down, Elsa,\\" Father said. I gathered all my courage and looked down. I saw the square in the center of the village, And I saw the criss-cross of streets leading to the square. \\"See, my dear,\\" Father said gently, \\"There is more than one way to the square.

HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein BODY: ? ?WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis fails to clean up the power mess. ?? \\"All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the governor will have on the ticket up and down,\\" said state Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda. \\"If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that could be problematic.\\" ? ?Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters understand Davis didn't create the problem. ?? \\"It won't be solved in six months,\\" South said. \\"This is an immediate problem that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year process to get this situation back under control.\\" ? ?As for the governor's critics, \\"I think they should be asked to produce their own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read about in the newspapers have no plan.\\" ? ?The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political damage. ? ?Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the state's congressional delegation. ? ?Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised to make the hallmark of his first term. ? ?But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight. ? ?Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento who won't be attending to quip, \\"We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We don't need to go to Disneyland for that.\\" ? ?Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled the events of the past week. \\"In many ways, he appears to have gone politically tone deaf,\\" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate University. \\"His instincts are not serving him well.\\" ? ?While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them that a 10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis, Davis was at a 10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money for his re-election campaign. ? ?When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for months, Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and that he thought it was premature. ? ?Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. \\"I'm glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight weeks,\\" said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. \\"There's a high level of frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is.\\" ? ?South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the governor's control. \\"No one can predict with any certainty where this is going to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to do.\\" ? ?As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and Democrats remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are blocking efforts to cap prices. ? ?Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted Davis could weather the electricity crisis. \\"People who are following it know it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't have any plausible alternatives,\\" he said. ?? \\"My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't necessarily take it out on (Davis).\\" ? ?It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare, pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California. ?? \\"The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are,\\" he said. \\"That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this summer.\\" Generate a subject line for this email.","completion":"Subject Line: Democrats Warn Gov.

Answer the following question: Background: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Paragraph: Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country's cars, Cuba's or Panama's, will emit more nitrogen oxides? Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, Cuba's cars will emit more nitrogen oxides than Panama's cars. Step 1: Identify the difference between the two countries' cars. Cuban cars are primarily from the late 1940s and early 1950s, and their engines were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. In contrast, Panamanian cars have the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology due to their trade relations with Japan. Step 2: Understand the purpose of catalytic converters. Catalytic converters help reduce emissions of harmful materials like nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons by causing them to react and change into less harmful products. Step 3: Compare the emissions between cars with and without catalytic converters. Cuban cars, which lack catalytic converters, are more likely to emit higher amounts of nitrogen oxides due to incomplete reactions within the engine. Panamanian cars, equipped with the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology, are more efficient in reducing and controlling harmful emissions, including nitrogen oxides.

Annie George faces up to 10 years in prison and a 250,000 fine if found guilty of harboring an illegal immigrant for private financial gain.","completion":"Title: The Unveiling of an Unsettling Case: Annie George and the Harboring of an Illegal Immigrant for Financial Gain Introduction In a shocking case that has captured the attention of the American public and highlighted the consequences of human trafficking, prosecutors presented their allegations against Annie George, a woman accused of harboring an illegal immigrant for private financial gain, with the potential of facing up to 10 years in prison and a 250,000 fine if found guilty. In this article, we will delve into the details of this heart-wrenching case and discuss the implications it has on the fight against human trafficking. Background of the Case Annie George was accused by prosecutors of owing her housekeeper, Valsamma Mathai, 317,000 based on the minimum wage and overtime rates. Mathai, an illegal immigrant from India, was allegedly removed from George's residence in May 2011 after her son in India called the National Human Trafficking Resources Center to report the situation. The Removal of Mathai and Discovery of the Exploitation It is alleged that Valsamma Mathai worked for Annie George and her family for more than five years, during which she was subjected to inhumane working conditions and forced to work long hours without a fair wage. The situation came to light when Mathai's son in India contacted the National Human Trafficking Resources Center to report his mother's circumstances. The authorities intervened, removing Mathai from George's residence in May 2011. Prosecutors' Allegations and Potential Consequences The prosecutors in the case against Annie George maintain that she owes the victim 317,000 in back pay, calculated based on the minimum wage and overtime legal rates. Furthermore, they argue that George's actions amount to harboring an illegal immigrant for private financial gain, a crime that carries severe penalties under the US federal law. If found guilty, Annie George could face up to 10 years in prison and a whopping 250,000 fine. The Fight against Human Trafficking The case of Annie George and Valsamma Mathai brings to light the dark reality of human trafficking, an issue that affects millions of people worldwide. It is a grim reminder of the exploitation that many vulnerable individuals face at the hands of those who seek personal financial gain through their suffering. It is imperative that society and governing authorities continue to work together to combat human trafficking and ensure that victims like Mathai receive justice and protection. This case serves as a warning to those who may be harboring illegal immigrants for personal gain and speaks to the necessity of strict enforcement of existing laws against these heinous crimes. Conclusion As the case against Annie George unfolds, our understanding of the harrowing experiences faced by Valsamma Mathai and countless others like her grows. Prosecutors will continue to seek justice for the victim, while the potential sentence of 10 years in prison and a 250,000 fine looms for the accused. As a society, it is our responsibility to remain vigilant in the fight against human trafficking, constantly working towards its eradication and support for its victims. The case of Annie George and Valsamma Mathai reminds us of the urgency of this task and the grave consequences of those who choose to exploit others for personal gain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Product review: I chose this book thinking that I would be reading the story of the author's hike through the Appalachian Trail. Instead, she would write a few paragraphs about her experience, then go off on a completely different subject, opining her liberal views on the national park system, reintroduction of wildlife, Indian mythology, blah, blah, blah. After the first 100 pages, I started skipping pages at a time just to get back to what I assumed was the point of her story--the trail hike. She and her boyfriend seemed quite likable--but you never got a real feel of how this affected them. Even the epilogue was vague. Where is she living? What is her occupation? Did they ever marry? Yeah, they ate granola then junk food, but how did this affect the rest of her life (as she continued to claim that it would)? The answer is:","completion":"Given the details in the review, it appears to have a negative tone overall.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what might happen: 1. Once the dog catches the frisbee, it would naturally hold onto it with its mouth. - Justification: Dogs have learned through playing that they should hold onto toys with their mouths, especially when it comes to fetch-like activities. 2. The dog is likely trained or instinctively knows to return the frisbee to its owner. - Justification: This is a common game that dogs play with their owners, and they often have experience with this sequence of actions. 3. The dog starts running back towards the owner, frisbee still in its mouth. - Justification: The dog knows it needs to bring the frisbee back to the owner in order for the game to continue. 4. As the dog approaches the owner, it might wag its tail, showing excitement and happiness from playing this game. - Justification: Dogs often express their emotions through their tail movement, and wagging is a sign of happiness and excitement. 5. The dog drops the frisbee at the owner's feet, or the owner might take the frisbee from the dog's mouth. - Justification: In either case, the dog is returning the frisbee to the owner so that they can continue playing the game. 6. The owner praises the dog, perhaps petting it or offering verbal encouragement. - Justification: Positive reinforcement is important in training and bonding with a dog, and the owner is likely happy that the dog successfully caught and returned the frisbee. 7. The game may continue as the owner throws the frisbee again for the dog to catch, or they may decide to take a break or finish playing. - Justification: This decision may be influenced by factors such as how tired the dog or owner is, or how much time they have to play. In conclusion, the most natural action that follows the dog catching the frisbee is for it to return the frisbee to its owner, with the owner reinforcing the positive behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"Wash with a moisturizing shampoo. Condition regularly. Try a mask or overnight conditioner for very dry hair. Give your hair some extra TLC.\\"","completion":"Title: Revitalize Your Locks: Nourishing Tips and Tricks for Dry Hair Introduction Dry hair can be both a burden and a challenge, transforming even the most beautiful tresses into a brittle, dull, and unmanageable mess. The good news is that you don't have to live with parched locks. By incorporating some simple changes into your hair care routine, you can successfully combat dryness and achieve healthy, shiny, and captivating hair. In this article, we will explore the most crucial steps to follow so that you can give your hair the tender loving care it deserves. Step 1: Use a Moisturizing Shampoo The first step in battling dry hair is to wash it using a moisturizing shampoo. Moisturizing shampoos are specifically designed to provide hydration and nourishment to parched locks. These gentle shampoos will cleanse your hair without stripping it of its natural oils, thus maintaining the much-needed moisture balance. When selecting a shampoo, look for ingredients such as glycerin, panthenol, and natural oils like argan, coconut, or almond, which help to lock in moisture and improve the overall health of your hair. Additionally, avoid shampoos that contain harsh sulfates and alcohol, as they can exacerbate dryness. Step 2: Condition Regularly Conditioning your hair is a crucial aspect of maintaining moisture levels and preventing breakage. After you've shampooed your hair, apply a generous amount of a hydrating conditioner from mid-shaft to the ends, allowing it to sit for 3-5 minutes. This step ensures that the conditioner penetrates the hair shaft, delivering essential nutrients and moisture. Choose a high-quality conditioner containing nourishing ingredients such as shea butter, aloe vera, and plant-based oils like jojoba or avocado. These ingredients work together to not only replenish lost moisture but also to strengthen your hair, making it more resistant to damage. Step 3: Incorporate a Hair Mask or Overnight Conditioner For those with extremely dry or damaged hair, introducing a deep conditioning mask or overnight conditioner into your hair care routine can make all the difference. These intensive treatments deliver a boost of hydration, penetrating deep into the hair shaft to impart moisture and restore vitality. Aim to use a hair mask or overnight conditioner once a week. However, if your hair is severely damaged or over-processed, you may need to use them more frequently – perhaps twice a week – to achieve optimal results. Look for masks and conditioners with ingredients such as keratin, silk proteins, and natural oils, which have proven restorative properties. Step 4: Give Your Hair Some Extra TLC Treat your hair with love and care by making minor adjustments to your daily styling routine. Minimize heat exposure by allowing your hair to air dry when possible or using a heat protectant spray when you must use styling tools. Opt for satin or silk pillowcases to reduce friction at night, and embrace gentle detangling methods, such as using a wide-tooth comb. Moreover, protect your hair from harsh environmental factors like sun, wind, and chlorine by wearing a hat or using UV-protective products. Taking these small yet significant steps can help shield your hair from further dryness and damage. Conclusion It's never too late to revive dry and damaged hair. By incorporating these tips and tricks into your daily hair care routine – washing with a moisturizing shampoo, conditioning regularly, using hair masks and overnight treatments, and giving your hair some extra TLC – you can reclaim the health, shine, and softness of your locks. Remember that consistency is key – make these practices a habit, and you'll be well on your way to healthy, vibrant tresses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: You may have heard the term \\"the American Dream\\". In 1848, James W. Marshall found gold in California and people began having golden dreams. That 19th century \\"American Dream\\" motivated the Gold Rush and gave California its nickname of the \\"Golden State\\". The American Dream drove not only 1800s gold-rush prospectors but also waves of immigrants throughout that century and the next. People from Europe, and a large number of Chinese, arrived in the US in the 19th century hoping that in America they would find gold in the streets. But most, instead, worked as railroad labourers. They created the oldest Chinatown, in San Francisco, and gave the city a Chinese name \\"the old gold hill\\". In the 20th century, some critics said that it was no longer possible to become prosperous through determination and hard work. Unfair education for students from poor families and racial discrimination almost made the American Dream a nightmare. Then, in the 1990s, California saw a new wave of dreamers in Silicon Valley. People poured their energy into the Internet. This new chapter of the American Dream attracted many business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups and seek fortunes in America. Better pay, a nice house, and a rising standard of living will always be attractive. However, the new American Dream is no longer just about money. It encourages Americans to consume wisely to protect the environment, improve the quality of life, and promote social justice. The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become the model of the new American Dream. After years of hard work, he grew from a poor young man from Austria into a movie superstar and then governor. Many people hope his story can save the American Dream and give California a brighter future. Question: It can be inferred that _ . Options: A: America's golden dream could never be realized B: America's golden dream had bought great fortunes to Chinese immigrants C: each period of time has its own taste of the American dream D: determination and hard work are the best way to realize the American dream Answer:","completion":"C: each period of time has its own taste of the American dream The article discusses different periods of time with their own interpretations and manifestations of the American Dream. In the 19th century, the American Dream was represented by the Gold Rush, drawing many people to California in search of wealth, including immigrants from Europe and China. During that period, the American Dream was primarily about wealth and opportunity. In the 20th century, however, the focus of the American Dream shifted. Critics argued that prosperity was no longer achievable solely through determination and hard work due to factors such as unfair education and racial discrimination. As a result, the American Dream's image suffered. Then, in the 1990s, the American Dream experienced a revival in Silicon Valley. People flocked to the area, fueled by opportunities in the technology industry and the potential for wealth creation - a new chapter of the dream. This attracted business people and young talents from China and India to form start-ups in the United States. The article notes that the contemporary American Dream is no longer just about money but also involves wise consumption, environmental protection, social justice, and overall quality of life improvement. This shift is exemplified by the story of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who overcame hardship and adversity through hard work, achieving success in both the entertainment industry and politics. From these different interpretations of the American Dream throughout history, it can be inferred that each period of time has its own taste of the American Dream, reflecting the changing values and aspirations of the people at the time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Which lever would have more friction, lever A or lever B? A:","completion":"Let's consider the properties of each lever before determining which would have more friction: Lever A: 1. Hypothetical lever 2. Ideal mechanical advantage 3.

Friction is the resistance between two surfaces sliding or trying to slide against each other. In a real-world situation, friction is often present and can influence the efficiency of a system. Since Lever A is hypothetical and has an ideal mechanical advantage, we can assume that it is designed to have no friction, as hypothetical systems often disregard real-world inefficiencies like friction. In contrast, Lever B is a real-world lever, and real-world systems typically experience friction. Therefore, Lever B would have more friction than Lever A, as Lever A is an idealized system without friction, while Lever B has to deal with real-world conditions and inefficiencies."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which fictional character from children's literature came from Darkest Peru ????","completion":"The fictional character from children's literature who came from Darkest Peru is Paddington Bear. Created by British author Michael Bond and first introduced in the book 'A Bear Called Paddington,' published in 1958, Paddington Bear has since become an iconic figure in children's literature, capturing the hearts of readers worldwide. Paddington, a small and curious bear with a fondness for marmalade, was discovered by the Brown family at Paddington Station in London. He was wearing a tag around his neck that read, \\"Please look after this bear. Thank you.\\" The label prompts the Brown family to adopt him, and they give him the name \\"Paddington\\" after the station where they found him, allowing him to begin a new life in England. Throughout his adventures, Paddington's character is characterized by his kindness, politeness, and charming innocence, often getting into comical mishaps due to his curiosity and naivety. His appearance, notably featuring a red hat, a blue duffle coat, and, in some later stories, Wellington boots, has remained a crucial part of the character's design. Originating from \\"Darkest Peru,\\" Paddington's backstory includes him living with his Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo. After an earthquake destroys their home, Aunt Lucy sends Paddington to England in search of a better life. In later stories, it is revealed that Aunt Lucy resides in the Home for Retired Bears in Lima, Peru, with Paddington frequently writing letters to her and occasionally sending her presents. The tales of Paddington Bear have been adapted into various formats over the years, including television series, animated cartoons, and feature films. The Paddington Bear stories' worldwide popularity has led to the creation of numerous merchandise, including stuffed bears, toys, and decorative items. In conclusion, the beloved character of Paddington Bear originated from Darkest Peru, where he lived with his relatives before traveling to London and being adopted by the Brown family. Through his adventures, the character has become synonymous with kindness, compassion, and the quintessential charm of British children's literature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The program focused on a recent controversial issue, triggered by First Experimental Primary School in Northwestern China's Xi'an that made children whose schoolwork and general behavior were not yet good enough to wear green scarves instead of the red scarf of the Chinese Young Pioneers. \\"The original idea for designing the green scarf was to strengthen education and to encourage the pupils to work harder,\\" said Chen Hong, the school's principal.

Plot title: Chinatown Movie plot: A woman identifying herself as Evelyn Mulwray hires private investigator J. J. \\"Jake\\" Gittes to surveil her husband, Hollis Mulwray, chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Gittes tails him, hears him publicly oppose the creation of a new reservoir, and shoots photographs of him with a young woman, which are published on the front page of the following day's paper. Back at his office, Gittes is confronted by a woman who informs him she is the real Evelyn Mulwray, and that he can expect a lawsuit. Realizing he was set up, Gittes assumes that Mulwray's husband is the real target. Before he can question him, Lieutenant Lou Escobar fishes Mulwray, drowned, from a freshwater reservoir. Under retainer to Mrs. Mulwray, Gittes investigates his suspicions of murder and notices that, although huge quantities of water are released from the reservoir every night, the land is almost dry. Gittes is warned off by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill and a henchman, who slashes Gittes's nose. Back at his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the imposter Mrs. Mulwray. She is afraid to identify her employer, but tells Gittes to check the day's obituaries. Gittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of his wife's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at his personal club, Cross warns Gittes that he does not understand the forces at work, and offers to double Gittes's fee to search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has changed ownership. Investigating the valley, he is attacked by angry landowners, who believe he is an agent of the water department attempting to force them out by sabotaging their water supply.

A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Coral reefs provide food and shelter to animals that require what?\\" would be \\"salinity.\\" Coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystems that support a wide variety of marine flora and fauna. These delicate ecosystems are found in shallow, tropical waters where sunlight can penetrate, ensuring the required conditions for the growth and survival of coral polyps and the microscopic algae (zooxanthellae) living within their tissues. The mutualistic relationship between these two organisms contributes significantly to the productivity and structural complexity of the reef. Salinity, or the concentration of dissolved salts in water, is a critical factor for the survival of marine organisms in coral reef ecosystems. Most marine organisms are adapted to specific salinity ranges and require stable salinity levels to maintain their own internal balance. This balance, known as osmoregulation, allows the organisms to thrive in their specific environment. A sudden change in salinity can cause stress to these organisms, resulting in decreased growth rates, reproductive failure, and, ultimately, death. The animals that rely on coral reefs for food and shelter, such as fish, sea turtles, and invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans, require stable salinity levels to maintain their vital physiological functions. Additionally, the corals themselves require a balance of salinity for their own survival. While corals have mechanisms to tolerate slight fluctuations, prolonged exposure to significant changes in salinity can lead to coral bleaching, a condition in which the zooxanthellae are expelled, leading to the eventual death of coral colonies. This in turn reduces the availability of food and shelter for many other marine organisms that rely on coral reefs. In summary, salinity is the most appropriate answer as it is a crucial factor in the overall health and stability of coral reef ecosystems. A balanced salinity is necessary for the numerous marine organisms that depend on coral reefs for their food and shelter to properly maintain their internal balance and thrive in their specific aquatic environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features. - This is a list of magazines marketed primarily for computer and technology enthusiasts or users . The majority of these magazines cover general computer topics or several non-specific subject areas , however a few are also specialized to a certain area of computing and are listed separately . - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - A magazine is a publication, usually a periodical publication, which is printed or electronically published (sometimes referred to as an online magazine). Magazines are generally published on a regular schedule and contain a variety of content. They are generally financed by advertising, by a purchase price, by prepaid subscriptions, or a combination of the three.At its root, the word \\"magazine\\" refers to a collection or storage location. In the case of written publication, it is a collection of written articles. This explains why magazine publications share the word root with gunpowder magazines, artillery magazines, firearms magazines, and, in French, retail stores such as department stores. - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques. - An online magazine is a magazine published on the Internet, through bulletin board systems and other forms of public computer networks. One of the first magazines to convert from a print magazine format to being online only was the computer magazine Datamation. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - A skill is the ability to carry out a task with pre-determined results often within a given amount of time, energy, or both. Skills can often be divided into domain general and domain-specific skills. For example, in the domain of work, some general skills would include time management, teamwork and leadership, self-motivation and others, whereas domain-specific skills would be useful only for a certain job. Skill usually requires certain environmental stimuli and situations to assess the level of skill being shown and used. - A control system manages, commands, directs or regulates the behaviour of other devices or systems. It can range from a home heating controller using a thermostat controlling a domestic boiler to large Industrial control systems which are used for controlling processes or machines. - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery.

Short sellers are upping their bets on retailers As a whole, those teen retailers have suffered recently as tastes change, moms disapprove, and new stores encroach on their territory. But earnings so far this quarter have surprised to the upside—despite short sellers seemingly anticipating a flunking grade for their back-to-school test. Stock exchanges publish semi-monthly information on short interest, so the most recent data for these retailers goes back to Aug. 1 figures, and many of the shorts may have exited since these company's earnings announcements and back-to-school projections. In fact, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Richard Jaffe pointed to American Eagle's 15 percent jump since its Wednesday earning announcement as evidence that its \\"encouraging view for the back-to-school season\\" may have led some to ditch their short bet.

Thirty-five years later, the middle-aged Kate 'Ma' Barker (Shelley Winters) now brutalizes innocent people herself, while indulging her monstrous sexual appetites. She lives by robbing banks with her four sons; the pragmatic Arthur (Clint Kimbrough), the sadistic Herman (Don Stroud), the bisexual Fred (Robert Walden), and the loyal, drug-addicted Lloyd (Robert De Niro). It all begins in the late 1920s when Ma leaves her husband, George, and her Arkansas home and embarks on her own with her four sons on a robbery-murder spree to make her own fortune, while keeping them under a tight leash. When Herman and Fred are arrested and imprisoned for petty theft charges, Ma takes over the group and leads Arthur and Lloyd on a bank robbery spree to gain enough money to get her sons out of jail. The gang is joined by a gunman named Kevin (Bruce Dern) who was Fred's cellmate during his incarceration (and his strongly implied lover). The group is also joined by a local prostitute named Mona Gibson, whom Herman frequented before his imprisonment. The gang resorts to more violent action and robberies. While hiding out at a cabin in Kentucky, Lloyd comes across a young woman swimming at a nearby lake whom he sexually assaults. Not wanting the woman to report them to the police, the Barkers hold her captive and Ma eventually kills her by drowning her, despite the protests of her sons. Some time later, the gang arrives in Tennessee where they abduct a wealthy businessman named Sam Pendlebury (Pat Hingle). Holding him for a 300,000 ransom, the sons, particularly Herman, bond with their captive whom they see as the sympathetic father figure they never had. When Herman and Mona go to collect the ransom, they are chased by a pair of FBI agents and barely escape. When they find that the ransom is only half of what they originally demanded, Ma orders her sons to kill Sam rather than let him go. But none of them can bring themselves to do it...

If the new rules proposed are more expensive, it will directly impact the process of making the rocket more efficient, since the cost of making modifications that adhere to the new regulations will likely increase. For example, the new rules may demand higher standards for rocket materials or more extensive safety inspections, which will directly increase costs. Indirectly, it could affect other steps of the process. More funds being allocated to adhere to the new regulations may result in less funds being available for other steps like the preparations for the crew, the launch, and the operation of the satellite. Alternatively, the need to raise more funds to adhere to the new rules could introduce delays to the entire process, affecting every step from the initial planning to the final launch. Nonetheless, it's also important to point out that these new rules might actually help make the rocket more efficient in the long run, even if they increase costs in the short term. This is because they could promote the adoption of newer, more advanced technologies, or lead to innovations aimed at reducing costs elsewhere to balance out the increased expenses from complying with the new regulations.

You just have to pass it, but how? You didn't even open the book the night before and you hear a voice in your head saying \\"Cheat, cheat ...\\" So what are you going to do, ignore it and fail or go for it? It's a tough decision many students must make. Most young people believe that cheating is wrong. However, they have cheated at least once in their high school years. So, why do they do it? Are they too lazy to study? Perhaps, it's not as simple as that. According to some experts, one main reason why students cheat is that they see their friends get away with it. It's an easy way out. They avoid embarrassment and their parents' anger for not doing well in an exam. Another reason is that students think it's OK to cheat if the subject isn't important for their future career. What's more, most students have to put up with the pressure of getting into university. They need to get good marks to carry on with their studies. This means that there will always be students who will do anything for a better mark. It has never been easier to cheat than it is today. With all the technology available, students needn't cheat by looking over their shoulders anymore. They use mobile phones to send answers to each other during a test. There is also the Internet. With hundreds of websites, students don't have to worry because they can find lots of material which they can copy and use in projects. There are even tips on the art of cheating in exams. Obviously, if you get caught cheating, you fail the exam or the subject. But it doesn't really matter whether you get caught or not. What's important is that it's wrong. You mustn't cheat because cheating is a lie. It deceives people into thinking you know more than you actually do. How can you be proud of something you have achieved through cheating? In the end, it's not about deceiving your teachers and your parents, but about fooling yourself that you can do something you really can't.

He is frequently ridiculed by everyone around him, except for his Jack Russell Terrier Milo, and his co-worker and best friend Charlie Schumaker. Meanwhile, gangster Dorian Tyrell, owner of the Coco Bongo nightclub, plots to overthrow his boss Niko. One day, Tyrell sends his singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle into Stanley's bank to record its layout, in preparation to rob the bank. Stanley is attracted to Tina, and she seems to reciprocate. After being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, he finds a wooden mask near the city's harbor. Placing it on his face transforms him into a zoot-suited, green-faced, bizarre trickster known as the Mask, who is able to cartoonishly alter himself and his surroundings at will. Stanley scares off a street gang that attempts to rob him by turning a balloon into a Tommy gun, and then he exacts revenge on his tormentors; he scares his grouchy landlady, and injures the con-artist repairmen who did unnecessary work on his car and charged him for it. The next morning, Stanley encounters detective Lieutenant Kellaway and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt investigating the Mask's activity of the previous night. To attend Tina's performance, he again becomes the Mask to raid the bank, inadvertently foiling Tyrell's plan in the process. At the Coco Bongo, Stanley dances exuberantly with Tina, whom he ends up kissing. Following a confrontation with Tyrell for disrupting the bank robbery, Stanley flees leaving behind a scrap of cloth from his suit that transforms back into his pajamas, while Tyrell is arrested by the police as a suspect for the bank robbery. Based on the shred of cloth, Kellaway suspects Stanley to be the bank robber; he believes that \\"there can't be two idiots with those kind of pajamas.\\" Stanley later consults a psychiatrist who has recently published a book on masks, and is told that the object may be a depiction of Loki, the Norse god of darkness and mischief.

If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.

To arrive at a solid conclusion, we would need to understand the scope of the investigation, the methodology employed by the panel during the review, and the data considered to determine the factors leading to the Chinese rocket crash in February 1996. Furthermore, it would be important to know if there were any other independent reviews, scientific findings, or expert opinions corroborating the results of the Chinese investigators. Additionally, we cannot rule out the possibility of political influences, conflicts of interest, or corporate pressures potentially affecting the integrity of the review conducted by the panel. As the panel was chaired by an executive of a Loral subsidiary and comprised of other satellite manufacturers, it would be crucial to consider whether the panel might have had any vested interests in the outcome of their findings.

These actions occur in response to signals from the autonomic nervous system or the endocrine system. Constriction occurs when the muscular walls of blood vessels contract.

Please answer the following question: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Which bike shop completed more brake repairs? Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] A:","completion":"Based on the given information, it is difficult to determine which bike shop completed more brake repairs since the direct comparison between the two shops is not provided.

Movie title: The Mummy's Ghost Movie plot: In Egypt, Yousef Bey (John Carradine) journeys to a remote temple in answer to a summons from Andoheb, High Priest of Arkham (George Zucco). Andoheb has called him to undertake a mission for the priesthood, but first refreshes his memory on the story of Kharis (Lon Chaney Jr.).3000 years ago, Kharis and the Princess Ananka were involved in a forbidden love affair. The princess died and because of her sin, her soul was cursed forever. Kharis was buried alive along with her. 30 years prior to the present time, an expedition located and entered the tomb of Ananka. They fought and escaped from the guardian of the tomb-the living Mummy of Kharis. The archaeologists brought Ananka's body back to the Scripps Museum in the United States. However, the priests of Arkham sent Kharis to seek vengeance against the defilers of the tomb. Every person from the expedition that entered the tomb died at the Mummy's hands. Kharis was believed to be destroyed in a fire at the residence of Stephen Banning (Dick Foran), leader of the expedition.The same story is being told to a group of skeptical college students in Mapleton Massachusetts. Professor Norman (Frank Reicher) expands on the story, explaining how Kharis was kept alive by the fluid of the leaves of the Tana bush, a plant that has long been extinct. In fact, Professor Norman himself was entrusted with a quantity of the tana leaves that investigators found in order to conduct scientific research.After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey (Robert Lowery), meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori (Ramsay Ames), a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. Amina has been researching Egyptian history, which has brought on a strange, clouded feeling in her mind.Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef's mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt.

Q:Justin and Derek are accomplished competitive weight lifters. One day, Derek suffers a severe injury to his leg. Because of this injury, Derek is forced to stop exercising for several months. Justin remains injury free and continues to work out regularly on the other hand. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will lose less strength in their muscles? Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. A:","completion":"Given the information provided, Justin will lose less strength in his muscles. This is because he remains injury-free and continues to work out regularly, while Derek is forced to stop exercising for several months due to his leg injury. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles, and since Justin is consistently working out, his muscles will maintain their size and strength better than Derek's muscles, which will get smaller and weaker due to inactivity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(A) the unloaded ship (B) the full ship Choose the answer between \\"Unloaded cargo ship\\" and \\"Full cargo ship\\". Answer:","completion":"Unloaded cargo ship In order to determine which of the two identical cargo ships, assuming they have the same propulsion and engine system, would be going the fastest after 5 minutes, we first need to understand the factors that would affect a ship's movement. The primary force that propels cargo ships is the thrust generated by their engines, which work against the opposing forces of water resistance (drag), wind resistance, and gravitational force (related to the ship's weight). Among these forces, the ones affected by cargo load are water resistance and gravitational force, both being higher for a full cargo ship compared to an unloaded one. A full cargo ship, with its increased weight, will have greater water displacement, increasing the drag force on the ship. This makes it harder for the ship to accelerate and reach higher speeds. Furthermore, the added cargo weight increases the gravitational force that needs to be overcome for the ship to move forward. Consequently, the thrust generated by the engine has to work harder to counteract these forces. On the other hand, an unloaded cargo ship will have less water resistance because of the reduced water displacement, resulting in less drag force compared to a full cargo ship. Additionally, it will have a lower gravitational force to overcome, due to the lack of cargo. This allows the engine's thrust to propel the ship forward more effectively and with less opposition from the opposing forces. In our scenario, as both cargo ships start moving at the same time and share the same propulsion and engine systems, the unloaded cargo ship will encounter fewer forces against its forward motion. As a result, it will be able to accelerate more quickly and reach a higher speed after 5 minutes compared to the full cargo ship. Thus, the answer is the \\"Unloaded cargo ship.\\""},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

Context: Traditionally a carnival feast was the last opportunity to eat well before the time of food shortage at the end of the winter during which one was limited to the minimum necessary. On what nowadays is called vastenavond (the days before fasting) all the remaining winter stores of lard, butter and meat which were left would be eaten, for it would soon start to rot and decay. The selected livestock had in fact already been slaughtered in November and the meat would be no longer preservable. All the food that had survived the winter had to be eaten to assure that everyone was fed enough to survive until the coming spring would provide new food sources. A:","completion":"Stored food would eventually no longer be viable because it would start to rot and decay. In the context provided, during the time of the carnival feast, the remaining winter stores of lard, butter, and meat would be eaten because they would soon become inedible due to rotting and decaying. Furthermore, the meat from the slaughtered livestock in November would no longer be preservable, which means it must be consumed before it becomes unsuitable for consumption. This situation underscores the importance of consuming stored food before it spoils to ensure that everyone has enough to eat until new food sources become available."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Q: all_eq { all_rows ; country ; united states } A:","completion":"In this task, we need to classify the given command into one of the seven categories: majority, unique, superlative, count, comparative, aggregation, and ordinal. First, let's analyze the command: Q: all_eq { all_rows ; country ; united states } This command is using \\"all_eq\\" logical operator which returns whether all the values under the \\"country\\" header column are equal to \\"united states\\". The scope of this operation is \\"all_rows\\", which means it's checking this condition for the whole table. Now let's match the command with the categories: 1. majority: not applicable, since it's not about the majority of values. 2. unique: not applicable, since it's not about finding a unique row. 3. superlative: not applicable, since it's not about finding the max or min value. 4. ordinal: not applicable, since it's not about finding the n-th maximum or minimum value. 5. comparative: not applicable, since it's not about comparing two rows. 6. count: not applicable, since it's not about counting rows based on a specific column's value. 7. aggregation: not applicable, since it's not about sum or average value. However, although the given command doesn't fit any of the provided categories, it shares similarities with the \\"majority\\" category. The \\"all_eq\\" operator checks if all values meet a certain condition, while \\"majority\\" checks if most of the values meet a certain condition.

We want to find the value for 'b'. Here's the equation we have: -6093 = 41*b - 6257 To find 'b', we need to follow a few simple steps: Step 1: We want to get rid of the -6257 on the right side. To do that, we add 6257 to both sides of the equation. It's like adding the same amount to both of your hands, so it's fair. (-6093 + 6257) = 41*b - 6257 + 6257 Step 2: Now, we do the addition. 164 = 41*b Step 3: Next, we need to find the value of 'b'. Since 41 is being multiplied by 'b', what we do is the opposite, which is dividing by 41. We need to do this to both sides so it's fair. 164 / 41 = 41*b / 41 Step 4: Finally, we do the math and find the value of 'b'. 4 = b So, there you have it!

The report sheds light on the alleged inadequacies and failures of the country's expansive healthcare system, sparking arguments and disagreements among experts and policymakers. The Amnesty report claims that North Korea's healthcare is underfunded, understaffed, and in dire need of improvement. According to the document, the country's hospitals and clinics suffer from a lack of essential medical supplies, equipment, and trained medical personnel. This information is obtained through interviews with North Korean defectors and satellite images that corroborate their testimonies. The study offers a rare insight into the isolated nation's healthcare system, which has long been shrouded in secrecy. Despite the troubling revelations, the report has been met with its fair share of criticism. Some argue that the methodology Amnesty International has employed in gathering data relies too heavily on testimonies from defectors, making it difficult to get a complete and unbiased picture of the situation on the ground. Skeptics contend that these defectors may have personal motives for slandering the North Korean regime and could, therefore, provide an exaggerated or biased account of their experiences. Moreover, critics challenge the portrayal of North Korea's healthcare system as entirely deplorable. They point out that the country has made progress in reducing infant mortality rates and increasing life expectancy. It's essential to acknowledge these advancements while addressing malpractices and deficiencies. Others have raised concerns about the influence of politics on the report, questioning whether the intention behind the publication is to further isolate North Korea or to genuinely shed light on the welfare of its citizens. These critics propose that the focus should be placed more on finding ways to assist in improving the nation's healthcare system, rather than just highlighting its flaws. In conclusion, Amnesty International's report on North Korea's healthcare system has revealed significant concerns that merit further investigation and attention. However, it is crucial to approach this issue objectively, considering both the achievements and challenges in the system. Only through a balanced analysis can effective solutions and improvements in the healthcare system be brought about, ultimately benefiting the North Korean population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: The Lewinsky story exploded because it takes the president's behavior beyond the sexual into the criminal--with its looming questions of perjury and obstruction of justice. The premise suggests that the Lewinsky story gained significant attention not only because of the president's sexual behavior but also due to the added criminal aspect, which includes potential perjury and obstruction of justice. Hypothesis: The Lewinsky story is on the president's sexual escapades. The hypothesis states that the Lewinsky story deals with the president's sexual adventures. It does not elaborate on any other factors or aspects contributing to the story. Now, let's analyze the options: (a) Yes - This option implies that the premise being true guarantees the hypothesis is true as well. (b) It is not possible to tell - This option suggests that the provided information does not offer enough evidence to determine whether the hypothesis is true, given the premise. (c) No - This option implies that even if the premise is true, it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis.

Joe thoughtlessly suggested that perhaps the red-nosed man was in command, and had come to get the Bonita's cargo.

How can I stop being jealous of other girls that talk to my crush? If a girl tells you to stop flirting when you're not, could she be jealous? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"No, these are two different questions that tackle different aspects of jealousy in interpersonal relationships. Let's discuss them one by one. 1) How to stop being jealous of other girls who talk to your crush? Here's a step-by-step approach to this problem: - Acknowledge your feelings: It's essential to realize that it's completely normal to feel jealous once in a while. Everyone goes through this emotion at one point or another. Accepting your feelings is the first step towards understanding them. - Self-awareness: Identify exactly what about the situation is causing these feelings. Is it the time they spend together? The shared interests they might have? Understanding the root cause can help in dealing with the feeling. - Self-confidence: Boost your self-esteem. Remember all your positive attributes that make you unique. This helps reduce feelings of inadequacy and jealousy. - Communicate: If you're friends with your crush, it could help to discuss your feelings with them. Open, honest communication can often dispel any misconceptions or fears. - Distraction: Get involved in activities you love. This will distract you from these feelings and help you focus on positive aspects of your life. 2) If a girl tells you to stop flirting when you're not, could she be jealous? It can be difficult to determine accurately why someone acts the way they do, as people's motivations can be complex and are often related to their personal experiences, viewpoints, and emotions. However, there may be some general steps to understanding this situation: - Analyze her behaviour: Does she become more defensive or upset specifically when you are talking to other girls? If so, there's a chance she might be feeling jealous. - Direct communication: The best way to understand her feelings is to talk to her directly about it. Ask her why she told you to stop flirting, express your point of view, and talk it out. - Consider other factors: It could also be possible that she's not jealous but rather misunderstood your conversation, or she might feel uncomfortable with the way you interact with other girls. It's essential to consider all possibilities. Remember, it's important to navigate these situations with empathy and respect for the other person's feelings."},{"prompt":"Given the question: You are given a new situation: John is a nuclear scientist who works at the Fermi lab. Today, in front of him he has four samples, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. Sample A is the naturally occurring uranium. Sample B is enriched uranium. Sample C is the U-238, and sample D is the U-235. He needs to figure out how to best use them. and a hint : Naturally occurring uranium is composed almost entirely of two isotopes, uranium-238 (99%) and uranium-235 (1%). It is the uranium-235 that is fissionable (will undergo fission) and therefore, this is the uranium isotope than can be used for fuel in a nuclear reactor. For uranium to be used as fuel, the percent of uranium-235 must be increased to at least 3%. Uranium in which the U-235 content is more than 1% is called enriched uranium. Somehow, the two isotopes must be separated so that enriched uranium is available for use as fuel. Separating the isotope by chemical means (chemical reactions) is not successful because the isotopes have exactly the same chemistry. The only essential difference between U-238 and U-235 is their atomic masses; as a result, the two isotopes are separated by a physical means that takes advantage of the difference in mass. Please answer this question : Which sample would less likely be used as fuel, sample C or sample D? The answer is:","completion":"Sample C (U-238) would be less likely to be used as fuel because it is not fissionable and cannot provide the necessary reactions for nuclear energy production. Sample D (U-235) is the fissionable isotope and can be used as fuel in a nuclear reactor."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: If you find yourself getting stuck by the introduction and it is preventing you from writing the rest of your paper, skip it for now. Just write your thesis statement at the top of your paper and start on your body paragraphs. You may find it easier to write your introduction after you finish your essay, after you know what you end up saying with your essay. It is more important to get into a groove with your writing than to write each part in the order that it comes in the essay. An introduction should introduce your topic, state your argument, and provide your reader with the context of your essay. If sentences in your introduction do not help with any of those goals, they are likely unnecessary. A hook, often the very first sentence in your paper, is a sentence or two that “hooks” or grabs the interest of your audience. Commonly used hooks may be good for novice writers, but some college professors think that certain hooks are overused. A few ideas for hooks follow. A statistic (particularly one that seems surprising to the reader) can be a good way to start certain types of papers. Be sure the statistic is from a reliable source, like one from your school’s library database. A personal story or anecdote told in detail can draw the reader in. It should, however, be relevant to the topic, and you will need to explicitly connect it to your thesis statement. This may not be appropriate in a formal essay. A quotation from a famous person can be a good lead-in. However, since this is one method that has been overused, try putting a twist on this method by using a surprising quote, contradicting the quote, or using it in a new context. You will also need to connect this to your thesis clearly. Illuminating a paradox or puzzling scenario could draw your reader in by making them question something that is usually taken for granted. Try to avoid introductions that start by giving a dictionary definition of a word and explaining it or by asking a question. Avoid over-used and essentially empty phrases like “from the beginning of time” or “throughout the history of mankind.” You will need to write a few sentences that explain the context of your hook and transition into the thesis of your paper. If your hook is long, as with a detailed personal anecdote, this may be a phrase like “this experience has led me to believe that…” If your hook is shorter, like a statistic, you will likely need to write 3-4 sentences explaining your statistic and leading up to your thesis statement. Summary:","completion":"The article suggests that if you struggle with writing an introduction, it might be helpful to skip it initially and start with the body paragraphs of your essay. Writing the introduction after completing the essay can make it easier to provide context and properly introduce the topic, as you'll have a clearer understanding of what you've discussed throughout the paper. The introduction should include a thesis statement and, ideally, a hook to capture the reader's interest. There are several ways to create a hook, such as using a surprising statistic, a relevant personal story or anecdote, or a quote from a famous person, though some of these methods are considered overused. Other ways to engage readers include illuminating a paradox or presenting a puzzling scenario. The article advises against using dictionary definitions or clichéd phrases like \\"from the beginning of time\\" as hooks. After the hook, a few sentences are needed to provide context and transition to the thesis statement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A spokesman for the Scottish government said it was putting its \\"current programmatic advertising\\" on hold. YouTube owner Google said it would review its controls. Programmatic advertising allows companies to target specific audiences with their digital adverts. It means a father in his 30s might see adverts for children's toys, while a keen gardener might be targeted by horticultural companies. But a recent investigation by the Times found adverts were appearing alongside content from supporters of extremist groups, making them around Â£6 per 1,000 viewers, as well as making money for the company. The Scottish government told BBC Scotland it was taking steps to address the concerns. A spokesman said: \\"We strongly oppose all forms of extremism, intolerance and hate speech and take all steps possible to ensure our advertising appears in appropriate settings, including blacklisting and filtering out inappropriate websites. \\"We have put our current programmatic advertising on hold until we are confident that this issue has been dealt with. \\"We have also made it clear to the agencies who purchase advertising space on our behalf that we expect them to continue doing all they can to put robust barriers in place.\\" In a lengthy statement Google said it had \\"strict policies\\" which prevent adverts from appearing on websites with \\"hate speech, gory or offensive content\\".

To his dismay, it was overcast all night. Then he flew to Rome. There the sky was as clear as you could get at night. David was very happy about it. But I can use this background: Because of its temperature, the atmosphere emits infrared radiation. For example, on clear nights Earth's surface cools down faster than on cloudy nights. This is because clouds (H2O) are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation. This is also why it becomes colder at night at higher elevations. What is an answer for this question: In which place the Earth's surface would cool down slower, London or Rome? A:","completion":"The Earth's surface would cool down slower in London compared to Rome in this particular situation. This is because London experienced overcast conditions, meaning it had cloud cover during the night. Clouds are strong absorbers and emitters of infrared radiation, which helps in retaining heat in the atmosphere by trapping the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. Consequently, this prevents the surface from cooling down too quickly. On the other hand, Rome had clear skies. With a lack of cloud cover, there is less absorption and re-emission of infrared radiation, allowing the heat to escape more easily into space. As a result, the Earth's surface cools down faster on a clear night. In summary, the Earth's surface would cool down slower in London due to the overcast conditions, while it would cool down faster in Rome due to the clear skies at night."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At the moment, he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan, who has become a drug kingpin. Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld. Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers. That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife, Valerie, who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini, the gym teacher at the school she is principal of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and she tells him she never wants to see him again. The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan.

Rob Portman from his tireless campaigning for Mitt Romney in 2012. He was even on the short list to be Romney's running mate. He's been a leading Republican voice on economic issues for four decades. Now, the prominent Ohio conservative will be known for something else: reversing his hardline position against gay marriage. He invited CNN to his Senate office to reveal the news. \\"I'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples' opportunity to marry,\\" Portman told CNN. Portman stirs mixed reaction with same-sex marriage reversal. It has to do with another revelation, one deeply personal. His 21-year-old son, Will, is gay. \\"I've come to the conclusion that for me, personally, I think this is something that we should allow people to do, to get married, and to have the joy and stability of marriage that I've had for over 26 years. That I want all of my children to have, including our son, who is gay,\\" said Portman. Will Portman told his father and mother he is gay two years ago, when he was a freshman at Yale University. \\"My son came to Jane, my wife, and I, told us that he was gay, and that it was not a choice, and that it's just part of who he is, and that's who he'd been that way for as long as he could remember,\\" said Portman. What was the Republican senator's reaction? \\"Love. Support,\\" responded Portman. The president and the nation have evolved on same-sex marriage. And complete surprise. He told CNN that he never suspected that his son was gay. Portman says his son, now a junior in college, helped him work through his decision to announce his change in position on gay marriage and blessed the idea of publicly announcing Will Portman's sexuality. \\"I think he's happy and, you know, proud that we've come to this point, but he let it be my decision just as you know, it's going to be his decision as to the role he plays going forward in this whole issue,\\" said Portman. Until now, this was a secret to most people in politics, but not everyone. Last year, when Romney was vetting Portman to be his running mate, the Ohio Republican informed both Romney and his top campaign advisers that he has a gay son. Activists hail watershed moment in the gay rights movement. \\"I told Mitt Romney everything,\\" said Portman with a laugh. \\"That process is, intrusive would be one way to put it. But, no, yeah, I told him everything.\\" Portman, who was ultimately passed over as the GOP vice-presidential candidate in favor of Rep. Paul Ryan, said the fact that his son is gay was not the deal breaker for Romney. How does he know? \\"Well, because they told me,\\" said Portman. Portman told CNN he sought counsel from a Republican who did serve as vice president: Dick Cheney, the highest-ranking Republican with an openly gay child, his daughter Mary. 5 turning points in gay marriage debate. \\"I spoke to him personally; I actually met with him,\\" said Portman. He said Cheney's advice was simple: \\"'Follow your heart.'\\" \\"He was a good person to talk to because he also was surprised by the news, in that case, you know, his wonderful daughter, who he loves very much. And it forced him to re-think the issue too, and over time, he changed his view on it,\\" said Portman. \\"I followed his advice. You know, I followed my heart,\\" he said. Though he is a staunch conservative, Portman was never outspoken against gay marriage. But he consistently voted against it. Top Republicans sign brief supporting same-sex marriage. While in Congress, he supported a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage, voted for the Defense of Marriage Act and voted for a bill prohibiting gay couples in Washington from adopting. In 2011, 100 University of Michigan law school graduates walked out of Portman's commencement address to protest his position on gay rights after circulating a petition trying to get him removed as the event's speaker. \\"The decision to host a graduation speaker who is openly hostile to LGBT rights is deeply unfair to the LGBT students who will be in the audience this year celebrating their graduation,\\" read the petition. Portman admitted that when the protest occurred, he already knew his own son was gay. \\"It was a little odd. Look, and to be honest with you, it didn't affect that decision-making much, because it was, I didn't think it was appropriate,\\" Portman said. \\"But look, they had their freedom of speech rights to be able to do what they wanted to do.\\" Will Portman 'especially proud' of father. \\"But you know, what happened to me is really personal. I mean, I hadn't thought a lot about this issue. Again, my focus has been on other issues over my public policy career,\\" said Portman. Asked about why he is announcing this change of heart, since his son revealed it to him two years ago, Portman cited two reasons. He just recently became comfortable with his decision to shift his position on gay marriage, and also he said he knew the Supreme Court is considering a pair of gay marriage cases, and reporters would likely ask him for his position. \\"I thought it was the right time to let folks know where I stand so there's no confusion, so I would be clear about it,\\" said Portman. What would Portman say to gay constituents who may be glad he's changing his position on gay marriage, but also wondering why it took having a gay son to come around to supporting their rights? \\"Well, I would say that, you know, I've had a change of heart based on a personal experience. That's certainly true,\\" he responded with a shoulder shrug. Obama on same-sex marriage: Everyone is equal. But he also repeated a reality. His policy focus has been almost exclusively on economic issues. \\"Now it's different, you know. I hadn't expected to be in this position. But I do think, you know, having spent a lot of time thinking about it and working through this issue personally that, you know, this is where I am, for reasons that are consistent with my political philosophy, including family values, including being a conservative who believes the family is a building block of society, so I'm comfortable there now.\\" To be sure, Portman was anything but comfortable discussing something as private and personal as his son's sexuality, even noting how foreign it felt for someone with his Midwestern upbringing and sensibilities to talk publicly about such issues. At times, the press-savvy politician even seemed to tremble a bit. But it was also clear he was willing to endure the discussion in order to publicly tell his son that he is proud. \\"He wanted to tell us that there's something about him that we didn't know,\\" Portman said, reflecting on the day two years ago his son Will first told his parents he was gay. Portman quickly added that it \\"of course hasn't changed our view of him at all.\\" Read the latest news on CNN.com. Do you have a close friend or family member who has come out of the closet?

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"To analyze the truth of the second sentence based on the truth of the first sentence, let us first break down both sentences and explore their implications. Sentence 1: \\"Alas, the text could have done with more Shrum, who, let's hope, did not pen the line, Home is about freedom.\\" This sentence implies three things: 1. The writer believes that the text would have been better if it included more input from Shrum. 2. There is a line in the text that says, \\"Home is about freedom.\\" The writer questions if Shrum was the one who wrote that line. 3. The writer hopes that Shrum didn't write this line, possibly because they think that Shrum is generally a good writer and wouldn't write something like that. Sentence 2: \\"There is no way Shrum would have helped the text.\\" This sentence asserts one thing: 1. The writer believes that Shrum's inclusion of ideas would not have improved the text in any way. Now, let's evaluate the second sentence based on the premise that the first sentence is true. If the first sentence is true, then that means the writer believes that the text would have benefited from more input from Shrum. This directly contradicts the idea in the second sentence, which states that Shrum's contributions would not have helped the text. Therefore, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true because it contradicts the assertion made in the first sentence.

Q:The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh. Clinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \\"to help us defeat this threat.\\" She cited the need for \\"common sense reform\\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons. After Obama did not use the term \\"radical\\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \\"should step down.\\" Trump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States. \\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New... what did trump probably wear while doing his speech Pick the correct answer from the following options: - a white shirt - a black suit - not enough information - a red tie A:","completion":"There is not enough information to determine what Donald Trump wore during his speech."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.

Passage: Names of ionic compounds are derived from the names of the ions, with the name of the cation coming first, followed by the name of the anion. If an element can form cations of different charges, there are two alternate systems for indicating the compound’s name. In the Stock system, a roman numeral in parentheses indicates the charge on the cation. An example is the name for FeCl2, which is iron(II) chloride. In the common system, the suffixes -ous and -ic are used to stand for the lower and higher possible charge of the cation, respectively. These suffixes are attached to a stem representing the element (which frequently comes from the Latin form of the element name). An example is the common name for FeCl2, which is ferrous chloride. The formula mass of an ionic compound is the sum of the masses of each individual atom in the formula. Care must be taken when calculating formula masses for formulas containing multiple polyatomic ions because the subscript outside the parentheses refers to all the atoms in the polyatomic ion.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was transferred to the asylum while one of his children was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\"? from the following article ? Smetana's biographers describe him as physically frail and unimpressive in appearance yet, at least in his youth, he had a joie-de-vivre that women evidently found attractive. He was also excitable, passionate and strong-willed, determined to make his career in music whatever the hardships, over the wishes of his father who wanted him to become a brewer or a civil servant. Throughout his career he stood his ground; when under the severest of criticism for the \\"Wagnerism\\" in Dalibor he responded by writing Libuše, even more firmly based on the scale and concept of Wagnerian music drama. His personal life became stressful; his marriage to Bettina was loveless, and effectively broke down altogether in the years of illness and relative poverty towards the end of his life. Little of his relationships with his children is on record, although on the day that he was transferred to the asylum, Žofie was \\"crying as though her heart would break\\". There is broad agreement among most commentators that Smetana created a canon of Czech opera where none had previously existed, and that he developed a style of music in all his compositions that equated with the emergent Czech national spirit. A modified view is presented by the music writer Michael Steen, who questions whether \\"nationalistic music\\" can in fact exist: \\"We should recognise that, whereas music is infinitely expressive, on its own it is not good at describing concrete, earthly objects or concepts.\\" He concludes that much is dependent upon what listeners are conditioned to hear.According to the musicologist John Tyrrell, Smetana's close identification with Czech nationalism and the tragic circumstances of his last years, have affected the objectivity of assessments of his work, particularly in his native land. Tyrrell argues that the almost iconic status awarded to Smetana in his homeland \\"monumentalized him into a figure where any criticism of his life or work was discouraged\\" by the Czech authorities, even as late as the last part of the 20th century.

John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches. In respect to decision C, would Keith's strategy most likely maximize or not maximize the expected utility? Hint: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision). A:","completion":"To determine whether Keith's strategy would most likely maximize the expected utility for decision C, we will analyze his approach based on the given information and the hint provided. Step 1: Identify the decision-making strategies - John uses an optimal decision-making process, maximizing expected utility by comparing all available options and their outcomes. - Keith relies on hunches, making decisions based on his intuition rather than a systematic evaluation of the options. Step 2: Compare strategies in the context of uncertain outcomes - For decisions A and B, both John and Keith have certain outcomes and can make informed decisions. - For decision C, the outcome is uncertain. John would still apply optimal decision-making, calculating the expected utility based on probabilities and utility values for each possible outcome. Keith, however, would use his intuition, disregarding the formal evaluation process. Step 3: Evaluate Keith's strategy in terms of expected utility maximization - Since Keith is not using a systematic, probability-based evaluation approach for decision C, the likelihood of him maximizing the expected utility is lower compared to John's optimal decision-making process. Based on this analysis, Keith's strategy would most likely not maximize the expected utility for decision C, as it relies on intuition over a systematic evaluation of probabilities and utility values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the ones place is less than 5, round down to the nearest multiple of 10. 5. Store the rounded value in a new list. 6. Continue to the next integer until all integers have been rounded. 7. Return the list of rounded integers. Following these steps: Analyzing the first integer, 688: - The ones place is 8, which is greater than or equal to 5. - So we round up to 690. Next, -841: - The ones place is 1, which is less than 5. - So we round down to -840. Next, 119: - The ones place is 9, which is greater than or equal to 5. - So we round up to 120. Proceeding with the rest of the list: -520, 207, -421, 193, 375, -940, -576, -367. After rounding each integer following the steps above, we obtain the list: [690, -840, 120, -520, 210, -420, 190, 380, -940, -580, -370] So the final answer is: [690, -840, 120, -520, 210, -420, 190, 380, -940, -580, -370]"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Dara and Jody sat on the sun-scorched concrete with their backs against the bus shelter. They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him. At the end of the lesson Jody was packing her stuff up and didn't know what to do with the bottle of white-out, so she tossed it out the window of the classroom. Dara had seen her do it, and thought it was just so cool. Jody had done it not in the hope of getting attention, because no one was paying attention, they were all packing up their own crap as fast as possible; she'd just done it. Who choked on the apple?

Question: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Why will stress be detrimental to a person? - not enough information - Not allowing time for recovery - Focusing on varied and interesting life experiences - Allowing it to be a part of life balance Answer:","completion":"Stress can be detrimental to a person because of several reasons. Not allowing time for recovery is one of the main reasons why it can be damaging. The human body and mind function more efficiently when they have an ample amount of rest and recovery time. When a person is under constant stress, the resources in both the mind and body are depleted. Without sufficient recovery time, this depletion continues to build, leading to physical illnesses, mental health disorders, and a decrease in overall well-being. The second reason directly correlates with the lack of varied and interesting experiences in life. When a person focuses on one aspect of their life, like their career to the exclusion of all else, they miss out on a balanced life filled with various experiences. These diverse experiences can bring joy, happiness, and a sense of achievement that isn't tied solely to career advancement, leading to a healthier mental state. The final point is about accepting stress as a constant part of life. This acceptance normalizes the stress, making it harder for individuals to recognize the harm it may be causing. This can perpetuate a cycle of continuous stress, leading to burnout and causing a significant impact on an individual's personal and professional life. Therefore, the management of stress requires a balanced approach to lifestyle, ample time for recovery, and diverse life experiences to avoid its detrimental effects. The understanding of this can help to prevent high levels of stress being the norm and in turn, result in a healthier and happier life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? Options: A. Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same. B. not enough information C. They will be enrolled in a study. D. They will call their doctor. Answer:","completion":"A. Their blood pressure treatment protocol will stay the same."},{"prompt":"Instructions: In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Step 2: find without repetition County of the results of step 1 whose Color equals Red Output:","completion":"SELECT DISTINCT a.County FROM wine w JOIN grapes g ON w.GrapeID = g.GrapeID JOIN appellations a ON w.AppellationID = a.AppellationID WHERE w.Color = 'Red';"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings. Occasionally he played a six-string bass guitar, the Fender Bass VI, providing bass on some Beatles numbers (\\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\", \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"Helter Skelter\\") that occupied McCartney with another instrument. His other instrument of choice was the piano, on which he composed many songs, including \\"Imagine\\", described as his best-known solo work. His jamming on a piano with McCartney in 1963 led to the creation of the Beatles' first US number one, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\". In 1964, he became one of the first British musicians to acquire a Mellotron keyboard, though it was not heard on a Beatles recording until \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" in 1967. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the song that is considered Lennon's best known solo work?, what is it ?

The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

He was sent to prison, where he committed suicide. Samantha Finley (Erin Marie Hogan), her older brother Thomas (Shane Van Dyke), and their mother Ellen (Fia Perera) believe that Ellen has been making contact with her deceased husband, David. Soon the family claims that a demon is haunting them. At first, they think it is David, but after a series of horrible attacks on Samantha, they suspect otherwise. One night the camera records Ellen sitting up in bed and leaving her bedroom. She walks into the living room, where she writes something on a piece of paper. She then crumples the paper and walks back down the hallway. Thomas finds the paper under Samantha's pillow and sees that it spells out the word \\"MARON\\". Thomas suggests that Ellen and Samantha stay at a hotel while he sets up traps around the house with bells and wire. When the bells ring, Thomas investigates. The wire and bell outside his door are ripped from the wall and thrown at him. Thomas shuts himself in the bedroom and the demon bangs on his door. Thomas receives a phone call from Ellen, who is in hysterics after the demon apparently followed them and attacked Samantha. Upon returning to the house, Samantha hunches over in pain. Thomas awakens at night and finds his sister missing. He finds the attic ladder hanging down and ascends it to find her standing there undressed, in a trance.

Given the question: Given the following context: The term Belorussia (Russian: Белору́ссия, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, Russia) first rose in the days of the Russian Empire, and the Russian Tsar was usually styled \\"the Tsar of All the Russias\\", as Russia or the Russian Empire was formed by three parts of Russia—the Great, Little, and White. This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.After the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, the term \\"White Russia\\" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks. During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term Byelorussia was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, Byelorussia became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.The term Byelorussia (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called Republic of Belarus (Республика Беларусь spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be \\"Belarus\\". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their Belarusian language forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993. Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the Constitution of Belarus.Accordingly, the name Byelorussia was replaced by Belarus in English.

Victoria was considered simple as opposed to Rachel who was considered a genius because Choose from: (1). Victoria had a very low IQ.; (2). Rachel had a very low IQ.;","completion":"Victoria was considered simple as opposed to Rachel who was considered a genius because Victoria had a very low IQ. It should be noted that the concepts of intelligence and genius are multifaceted and cannot be reduced to a single number or value, such as an IQ score. However, in this particular context, the difference between their intellectual capacities was substantial and evident in multiple aspects of their lives. From a very young age, Victoria struggled academically. Her parents, who were perceptive of this, enrolled her in extra tutoring sessions and sought assistance from experts in a variety of subjects. Even after all these efforts, Victoria found it difficult to grasp complex concepts and keep up with her peers. The standardized tests that were used to measure the intellectual abilities of students in their schools consistently showed Victoria's low IQ. On the other hand, Rachel's academic achievements were extraordinary, reflecting her high IQ. She excelled in all subjects and her thirst for knowledge was insatiable. Rachel had an innate ability to comprehend complex ideas and solve problems that seemed unsolvable to many of her peers. Her intellect was not limited to bookish knowledge but also extended to problem-solving, creative thinking, and critical analysis. In the school environment, these differences became increasingly apparent not only to their teachers and classmates but also to themselves. Victoria, fully aware of her limitations, would often get discouraged by her own performance as compared to Rachel's accomplishments. This comparison served as a constant reminder of the wide gap that separated their intellectual abilities. In social settings, these differences manifested in various ways. Victoria would struggle to keep up with conversations that involved abstract or complex topics, often falling back on simpler subjects like popular culture or personal anecdotes. Rachel, in contrast, was comfortable diving into deep philosophical discussions or debating about the merits and drawbacks of various scientific discoveries. Despite their stark differences in intelligence, Victoria and Rachel shared other qualities that defined their personalities. For instance, Victoria had a keen sense of empathy and was able to connect with others on an emotional level, helping them feel at ease in her company. Rachel, too, had an empathetic side, but her brilliance often overshadowed it, leading some to perceive her as cold or aloof. As they grew older, Victoria and Rachel explored different paths in life. Victoria developed her skills in fields where intricate analytical thinking was not a prerequisite for success. She discovered her penchant for arts and crafts and ran a thriving business selling handmade items. Rachel pursued an illustrious academic career, delving into the intricacies of astrophysics and making groundbreaking discoveries in her field. In conclusion, the contrasting intellectual abilities between Victoria and Rachel were a result of Victoria's low IQ, which contributed to her being considered simple in comparison to Rachel's genius. Their respective paths exemplify that intelligence is not the only determinant of success or happiness in life, and that people can excel in different areas by harnessing their unique strengths and passions, regardless of their IQ scores."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while.

News article: American pop band Hanson slams Justin Bieber in a radio interview with Amos, Cat and Angus on Hit107. HANSON has slammed Justin Bieber, comparing both the pop star and his music to a sexually transmitted disease. Isaac, Taylor and Zac Hanson took the music world by storm 20 years ago when their song MMMBop went to number one in 27 different countries. But in an interview with Hit107 FM in Adelaide, they made it quite clear they’re not fans of current chart-topping artist, Bieber, who has three out of the top five singles on the ARIA charts. The brothers, who are now in their 30s, took part in a game called Whose Song is it Anyway? with breakfast radio hosts Amos Gill, Cat Lynch and Angus O’Loughlin. “Here’s the deal with this game,” one of the brothers said, “we’re gonna lose”. Admitting they don’t listen to much “modern” music, it wasn’t surprising that none of the Hanson members knew the title or artist of the biggest song in the country right now, Despacito. When the breakfast hosts told them it was by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber, the Hanson members couldn’t hide their disdain. “Can I just say I’m glad I didn’t know what that was,” one of the brothers said. “I prefer not to get any venereal diseases so whenever Justin Bieber gets near me or near my ears ... it’s just ear infections, they’re terrible.” Hanson, who seemed amused throughout the interview by the fact most Koala’s have chlamydia, then compared Bieber to one of the furry creatures. “It’s like hanging out with a koala,” one of them said, “Chlamydia of the ear, it sucks”. Hanson is currently touring Australia and will be performing at the Enmore Theatre in Sydney on June 21, The Star on the Gold Coast on June 24 and The Tivoli in Brisbane on June 25. Oh, and for the record, they lost the game of Whose Song is it Anyway? ||||| Singer appeared on a remix of the Spanish language hit by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee Footage has emerged of Justin Bieber failing to know the Spanish lyrics from his recent hit ‘Despacito’. ‘Despacito’ was originally released by Puerto Rican artists Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee in January, with Bieber later featuring on a remix of the track that reached number one in both the UK and the US. Bieber performed the song at 1Oak in New York on Tuesday night (May 23), singing “blah, blah, blah” during most of the chorus. Watch in the clip beneath: Listen to the Bieber remix of the track below: Earlier this week new support acts were announced for Justin Bieber’s huge summer show in London’s Hyde Park. The ‘Sorry’ singer will take to the stage in Hyde Park on Saturday July 2 as part of the Barclaycard British Summer Time series.

Now Naughty Boy, Dagny, Mabel, Jain, Nina Nesbitt, Sheppard, Will Heard, James Hersey, Louis The Child, Anna Of The North, Skinny Living and Glowie have all been added to the bill, too.

The singer behind ‘Despacito’ has defended Justin Bieber after he failed to remember the lyrics to the Spanish language song. Singer Luis Fonsi, who sings the main vocals on the hit track, stuck up for Bieber after he forgot the lyrics during a live performance – before being pelted with bottles when he refused to sing it all together. He told ABC Radio: “I mean, obviously I would love for him to…learn it. “I don’t blame him not knowing [the lyrics], and I think we have to give him a little bit of a pass because that’s not his main language.” He added: “We can’t expect the guy to just out of the blue get it perfectly. I mean, it’s obvious when he was recording the song he had the lyrics in front of him.” He also praised Bieber for choosing to sing the lyrics in Spanish, despite being offered the chance to record in English. “He had a chance to record the chorus in English, we had a full English lyric and he decided to take the time to record it in Spanish because he wanted to keep the originality of the song”, Fonsi added. “So I actually applaud the fact that he took the time in the recording studio to do it and he did a great job.” ||||| They also made fun of koalas, which was a bit rude. Once famous pop musicians Hanson are visiting Australia at the moment as part of a global tour celebrating their 25th anniversary as a band and 20 years since the release of their absurdly popular debut album, Middle of Nowhere. Yup, 20 years. Sorry, but you’re old now. This morning the band paid a visit to Adelaide’s Hit107 FM to chat with breakfast show hosts Amos Gill, Cat Lynch and Angus O’Loughlin. During the interview the Hit107 team decided to force the band to play one of those weird games commercial radio people seem obsessed with. This one is called “Whose Song Is It Anyway” and it involves… playing a song and guessing whose it is. Spicy, spicy stuff. During the game the opening riff to ‘Despacito’ by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber starts playing, but Hanson have no idea what this tune is, despite it’s enormous, enormous popularity. Not only that, it turns out they also really hate Justin Bieber. “Can I just say I’m glad I didn’t know what that was, because then I would have had to say ‘Despacito’,” said one Hanson. “I prefer not to get any venereal diseases so whenever Justin Bieber gets near me or near my ears … it’s just ear infections, they’re terrible,” said another Hanson. “It’s like hanging out with a koala… it’s chlamydia of the ear,” said another Hanson. Or maybe one of the same Hanson’s. I honestly don’t know. I’m just going to say it: I am not here for Hanson’s dumb roast of Bieber. First of all, how have they not heard ‘Despacito’? Earlier in the interview the group admitted that they don’t listen to a lot of “modern” music, which itself is a very lame thing to say. It’s 2017, not 2007. It’s cool to like pop music, guys. ‘Despacito’ is the biggest song in the world right now. It’s everywhere. Even your parents knows about it. It’s gone 34 times platinum in the US. THIRTY-FOUR TIMES PLATINUM. I guess to be fair to Hanson they collectively have 12 young kids between them, so maybe they are too busy rearing offspring to be across the music charts at the moment. Even if you excuse the ‘Despacito’ thing, what’s with the Bieber hate? We’re surely passed that now. Yeah, JB had some weird phases and has occasionally been a bit of an arrogant dick. What adolescent pop icon wouldn’t be? But he’s atoned, and now he just makes very good music. You’d think Hanson, of all people, could relate to what it’s like to become hugely famous at a young age. It’s hard to see it as anything other than a bit of professional jealousy. Hanson are so far past their prime that there’s a serious risk people reading this story thought it was about the One Nation leader having a go at Biebs. At least Bieber has his own Wikipedia page. The only member of Hanson to have a standalone page is Taylor (the hot one). The other two, Isaac and Zac, have to share a section on the main Hanson band page. Sucked in, lads. Anyway, this is was a dumb sledge by a band that peaked 20 years ago. And there was really no need to bring the plight of the chlamydia infected kolas into it either. Leave Bieber/our cuddly national icons alone, Hanson. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A news article talked about how the Hanson brothers, who were famous for their song \\"MMMBop\\", did not like Justin Bieber's music.

First, let's write our equation nicely: 1287 = -120c + 21c Right, now -120c and 21c are actually parts of the same group. This is because they both represent some number times 'c'. So we can combine them into one, just like we can combine 5 apples and 3 apples to get 8 apples. When we combine -120c and 21c, we get -99c. So our equation now looks like this: 1287 = -99c Now imagine you have 1287 toys and you want to share them equally among a certain number of friends 'c'. Each friend gets -99 toys. Of course, that’s impossible because you can’t give negative toys. But in math, we can solve such puzzles. So, we want to figure out how many friends or 'c' you have. To do this, we do what’s called ‘dividing’. Dividing is like sharing things out equally. So we're going to take our 1287 toys and divide them by -99 because that's the amount each friend is supposed to get. Mathematically, this looks like this: c = 1287 ÷ -99 When you do the division, you find that 'c' equals to approximately -13. So, 'c' is -13. It's like saying if you had -13 friends (which is funny because you can't really have negative friends, but in math, we can) and you could give each of them -99 toys, you'd share out exactly 1287 toys."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Because he won reelection, the president may be able to dictate the terms of a bipartisan debt-reduction deal, The Washington Post’s Lori Montgomery reports. President Obama Obama is ready to play hardball, his allies say. He’s prepared to veto legislation to block the “fiscal cliff” unless Republicans allow the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for those making more than 250,000 a year, the White House says. Because he won reelection, the president may be able to dictate the terms of a bipartisan debt-reduction deal, The Washington Post’s Lori Montgomery reports. Jonathan Ernst/Reuters With the election behind them, Obama and lawmakers have turned their attention to the fiscal cliff. Here’s a look at some of the leaders who will influence whether the country can avoid falling off the cliff. After a brutally divisive presidential campaign and two years of acrimony over the federal budget, the nation's leaders joined hands Friday and pledged fast and far-reaching action to tame the public debt and avoid economy-shaking tax hikes set to hit in January. In a display of bipartisanship unseen since the GOP captured the House in 2010, Republican and Democratic leaders met for more than an hour with President Obama at the White House. They emerged unified, with a message of reassurance for nervous taxpayers and investors — though intense haggling over the shape of a deal is yet to come. “I feel very good about what we were able to talk about in there,” Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) told reporters outside the White House, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Republicans John A. Boehner (Ohio), the House speaker, and Mitch McConnell (Ky.), the Senate minority leader, as well as House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.). “We all know something has to be done. There is no more ‘Let’s do it some other time.’ We’re going to do it now.” The usually sharp-tongued McConnell even praised Obama for his upcoming trip to Southeast Asia, although it will take the president away from Washington as policymakers rush to reach an agreement to avert 500 billion in tax hikes and automatic spending cuts that threaten to throw the nation back into recession early next year. “I can only echo the observations of the other leaders, that it was a constructive meeting,” McConnell said. “We all understand where we are.” What going over the 'fiscal cliff' would mean ... Major details — including the overall scope of a debt-reduction package — still have to be worked out. And the group made no progress Friday on their most fundamental point of disagreement: whether to extend the expiring George W. Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthiest 2 percent of U.S. households through 2013. But the leaders expressed optimism about reaching an accord before the cliff hits in January and dispatched staffers to draft a debt-reduction framework to present to Obama after the Thanksgiving break. Pelosi called on her colleagues to set a Christmas deadline for passing legislation to “send a message of confidence to consumers, to the markets.” U.S. stocks shot up while the leaders were speaking, going from negative to positive territory in a matter of minutes. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 113 points, gaining nearly 1 percent, in the half hour after the meeting ended. (The Dow closed up nearly 46 points, or 0.4 percent.) The upbeat tone marked a dramatic shift from the sullen relations of recent years, when Obama and a GOP fortified by anti- government activists clashed repeatedly over spending and taxes. For months, Washington lurched from crisis to crisis as Republicans threatened to shutter the government and prohibit additional borrowing unless Democrats agreed to massive cuts in spending. In 2011, a potential “grand bargain” between Boehner and Obama collapsed in angry finger-pointing and dueling news conferences. This year, a presidential campaign fueled by hundreds of millions of dollars in negative ads painted Obama as a free-spending redistributionist and the Republican standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, as an out-of-touch corporate robber baron. Since Nov. 6, when Obama won reelection and Democrats made gains in the House and Senate on a pledge to make the rich “pay their fair share,” Republicans have backed down from the fight. On Friday, McConnell and Boehner acknowledged the need for fresh revenue to restrain a public debt that has swollen to dangerous levels — as long as Democrats agree to tackle the rising cost of Medicare and Medicaid, the biggest drivers of future borrowing. “To show our seriousness, we’ve put revenue on the table,” Boehner said. But “it’s going to be incumbent for my colleagues to show the American people that we’re serious about cutting spending and solving our fiscal dilemma.” By all accounts, Obama and congressional leaders made progress on both fronts. During a meeting in the Roosevelt Room that included Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and White House economic adviser Gene Sperling, Obama acknowledged the need to tackle health-care spending, according to aides in both parties. And while Boehner argued that the economy would suffer if policymakers failed to maintain the Bush-era tax cuts for households at all income levels, Democrats said he did not insist that his caucus would reject any rise in the top tax rates, as he has in the past. “The tone was very good,” Geithner said afterward on Bloomberg TV. “They said what you’d hope for them to say at this point, which is that [an agreement] is something we can do, we’re committed to do it, we want to do it as soon as we can, we know the stakes are very high.” While Obama is out of the country, the leaders said, their staffs will get to work on a framework to replace the year-end fiscal cliff with a less abrupt and less economically-damaging debt-reduction plan. The savings would be generated in two stages. The first would be a down payment composed of immediate tax hikes and spending cuts to replace blunt, across-the-board budget cuts set in motion during the 2011 debt-limit fight. The second would be a mechanism to force an overhaul of the tax code and long-term changes to entitlement programs next year. “What we’re trying to do is to come up with a framework agreement that sets up a process for locking in long-term savings,” Geithner said. “But you have to do a meaningful amount of things upfront.” Pelosi told reporters after the meeting that the leaders did not discuss an overall savings target. But, she said, “I think it would be good if we did something in the 4 trillion category” — a figure that could stabilize the debt as a percentage of the economy. “My hope is that this is going to be the beginning of a fruitful process where we’re able to come to an agreement that will reduce our deficit in a balanced way,” Obama said as the meeting convened. Then he dismissed reporters, before remembering “one other point that I wanted to make”: Boehner’s birthday is Saturday. But “we’re not going to embarrass him with a cake,” Obama said, “because we didn’t know how many candles were needed.” Boehner, who is turning 63, playfully poked the president in the arm, and the two laughed and shook hands.

ADVERTISEMENT Obama will host Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) at 10:15 a.m. in the Roosevelt Room. Senior congressional aides, however, describe it as more of a photo-op than a substantive bargaining session. Informal talks are already under way, behind the scenes, between White House officials and congressional staff, according to a senior Senate aide. Obama has also called the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House to organize strategy. A senior House Democratic aide said Obama and Pelosi have spoken three times since the election. A senior House Republican aide, however, said Obama’s staff has not begun any informal talks with Boehner’s staff. Congressional leadership aides say Obama and Boehner will pick up where they left off in the summer of 2011, when they almost sealed a deal to cut hundreds of billions from Medicare and Medicaid and raise nearly 800 billion in new tax revenues. Obama and Boehner will lead the talks, but there will be more input from other congressional leaders this time compared to last year, when reports of the concessions Obama made to Boehner in private caught Democrats by surprise. Reid confronted Jack Lew, then the White House budget director, in July of 2011 about why he had been kept in the dark about hundreds of billions of dollars in proposed cuts. “I’m the Senate majority leader — why don’t I know about this deal?” Reid demanded as soon as Lew walked into a meeting with Senate Democrats. Congressional Democrats are pressing for more access to the talks. “I think everybody operates under the assumption that Speaker Boehner will need Democratic help on any proposal to get it out of the House,” said a Democratic aide. \\"I would think House Republicans would very much want House Democratic leadership at the table when any deal gets cut.” Senior congressional aides say there is no fixed negotiating group, such as a Gang of Six or a Committee of 12, as in past negotiations. The cast of participants will fluctuate as various players bid for their priorities. Yet the ultimate deciders will be Obama and Boehner. Republicans think Obama will be able to bring his party along to support any deal he signs off on, while Democrats say the House GOP conference, dominated by conservatives, will prove the biggest obstacle to passing a grand bargain through Congress. “The only way we’re going to solve this present crisis and get past the political stalemate is for the president himself to lead,” McConnell said Thursday. “He’s the only one who can lead the members of his own party to do something they wouldn’t ordinarily do.” “I think Pelosi and Reid will go along with whatever the White House delivers. It’s what Boehner can deliver” that will determine what gets through Congress, said a Republican senator. Republican senators predict members of their conference will sign off on any deal Boehner can move through the House. “We're going to have to get something that the president will sign and that the House will pass. And I think that [if] you get that, it will then ultimately have enough votes to pass in the Senate,” Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, said in an MSNBC interview. Senate Republican Whip Jon Kyl (Ariz.) said McConnell would be Boehner’s “wingman” in the talks. Some Democrats worry about the prospect of letting Obama and his senior advisers hash out a deal with Boehner on their own. They remember the steep cuts he reportedly agreed to in 2011 and the deal he struck with McConnell in December of 2010 to extend virtually all the Bush-era tax rates. House Democrats are demanding that Pelosi not be shut out of the talks, as she was in December of 2010, the last time the Bush tax cuts were due to expire. “She’s the Democratic leader of the House and I think she has to be at the table. Absolutely,” said Rep. Henry Waxman (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee and a Pelosi ally. “I’d expect she’d want to be at the table. She better be.” Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means panel, said Pelosi’s participation is “vital.” He said Democratic members of the Ways and Means panel would work closely with Pelosi. Pelosi said in a statement Thursday that “House Democrats will act as partners in an effort to reach an agreement.” Senate sources see the active involvement of Pelosi and Reid as intended to keep Obama from drifting too far toward accepting Republican demands on cutting Medicare and other safety-net programs. During the last round of talks with Boehner, Obama’s representatives agreed to cut 250 billion from Medicare over the next decade and use a new formula to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits, according to The New York Times. Reid has insisted Social Security stay off the bargaining table. Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Reid’s deputy, told reporters Wednesday that any deal to avoid the fiscal cliff must increase tax rates on families earning more than 250,000 annually. Obama will press congressional leaders Friday not to let disagreements over taxing the wealthy or reforming safety-net programs imperil a deal to extend current tax rates for middle-income families. “The president will also reiterate that he wants to work with leaders in both parties to achieve a significant, balanced deficit-reduction plan that puts our nation on a sustainable fiscal path,” said a White House official. Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee, thinks Obama will drive a harder bargain with Republicans this December. “I’m absolutely convinced that this time there will be a different end to this movie because the president has been absolutely clear that if we want to be serious about reducing the deficit, we’ve got to ask very wealthy people to contribute,” he said during a recent C-SPAN \\"Newsmakers\\" interview. |||||Summary:","completion":"According to the article, President Obama is prepared to veto any legislation that attempts to block the fiscal cliff unless Republicans allow the Bush-era tax cuts to expire for those making more than 250,000 per year.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who received his first musical education from his paternal grandfather? Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti).

Read this: A brief shoot at London's City Hall was filmed on 18 April 2015, while Mendes was on location. On 17 May 2015 filming took place on the Thames in London. Stunt scenes involving Craig and Seydoux on a speedboat as well as a low flying helicopter near Westminster Bridge were shot at night, with filming temporarily closing both Westminster and Lambeth Bridges. Scenes were also shot on the river near MI6's headquarters at Vauxhall Cross. The crew returned to the river less than a week later to film scenes solely set on Westminster Bridge. The London Fire Brigade was on set to simulate rain as well as monitor smoke used for filming. Craig, Seydoux, and Waltz, as well as Harris and Fiennes, were seen being filmed. Prior to this, scenes involving Fiennes were shot at a restaurant in Covent Garden. Filming then took place in Trafalgar Square.

Information: - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - American literature is the literature written or produced in the area of the United States and its preceding colonies. For more specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States. During its early history, America was a series of British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States. Therefore, its literary tradition begins as linked to the broader tradition of English literature. However, unique American characteristics and the breadth of its production usually now cause it to be considered a separate path and tradition. - A biography, or simply bio, is a detailed description of a person's life. It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death; it portrays a person's experience of these life events. Unlike a profile or curriculum vitae (résumé), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality. - Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections, and two non-fiction works. Additional works, including three novels, four short story collections, and three non-fiction works, were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature. - A memoir (from French: \\"mémoire\\": \\"memoria\\", meaning \\"memory\\" or \\"reminiscence\\") is a collection of memories that an individual writes about moments or events, both public or private, that took place in the subject's life. The assertions made in the work are understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story \\"of a life\\", while a memoir often tells \\"a story from a life\\", such as touchstone events and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a \\"memoirist\\" or a \\"memorialist\\". - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits.

The two married in 1921 after a courtship of less than a year, and moved to Paris within months of being married. In Paris, Hemingway pursued a writing career, and through him Hadley met other expatriate British and American writers. - An expatriate (often shortened to expat) is a person temporarily or permanently residing, as an immigrant, in a country other than that of their citizenship. The word comes from the Latin terms \\"ex\\" (\\"out of\\") and \\"patria\\" (\\"country, fatherland\\"). - An autobiography (from the Greek, -\\"autos\\" self + -\\"bios\\" life + -\\"graphein\\" to write) is a written account of the life of a person written by that person. In other words, it is a self-written life story. - A Moveable Feast is a memoir by American author Ernest Hemingway about his years as a struggling , young , expatriate journalist and writer in Paris in the 1920s . The book describes the author 's apprenticeship as a young writer while he was married to his first wife , Hadley Richardson .

And as far as I know, that is the case, because Dover says that it is a standards-based school, and so I assume that when they say that and they say that students have to pass certain material before they can be advanced into new material, that they would have to be abiding by the state standards. Hypothesis: Graduates from Dover have aquired the knowledge and learning required by state standards.","completion":"After reading the paragraph provided, the hypothesis appears to be true based on the information given. The paragraph states that Dover claims to be a standards-based school and that its students must pass certain material before advancing to new material. Additionally, it is assumed that Dover abides by state standards when stating these requirements for their students. The paragraph provides the following evidence in support of the hypothesis: 1. Dover claims to be a standards-based school: Standards-based schools use a set of clear, predetermined academic standards to guide instruction and assessment. These standards ensure that all students are learning and achieving the same objectives, regardless of where they attend school within a particular state. By identifying itself as a standards-based school, Dover indicates that it adheres to the state's academic standards. 2. Students must pass certain material before advancing to new material: This statement suggests that Dover has a system in place to ensure that its students meet specific learning objectives before they can progress in their education. This typically means that students must demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in a subject area or skill, as determined by the state standards, before they can move on to more advanced material. 3. The assumption that Dover abides by state standards: This assumption, while not directly stated, can be reasonably inferred from the paragraph. If Dover claims to be a standards-based school and requires students to pass certain material before advancing, it is logical to assume that the material students must pass is aligned with the state standards. Based on these points, the hypothesis that graduates from Dover have acquired the knowledge and learning required by state standards is supported by the information provided in the paragraph. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on an assumption and the information provided. Further investigation into Dover's curriculum, teaching practices, and student performance data would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis conclusively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What publication that the man who rose to national attention in 1956 was a \\"...a genuine cultural force\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, \\"He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\\" Al Green agreed: \\"He broke the ice for all of us.\\" President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: \\"His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country.\\" Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was one of the most famous people in the world.Presley's name, image, and voice are instantly recognizable around the globe. He has inspired a legion of impersonators. In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans. \\"Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century\\", said composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein. \\"He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everything—music, language, clothes. It's a whole new social revolution—the sixties came from it.\\" In the words of John Lennon, \\"Nothing really affected me until Elvis.\\" Bob Dylan described the sensation of first hearing Presley as \\"like busting out of jail\\".

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both.

UPDATED:. 18:57 EST, 26 February 2013. Katy and David Slade always knew they wanted a baby of their own. But with Katy unable to have children because of a rare genetic condition, they realised they might need some help to make their dream of a family come true. In the end, that help came from close to home. David’s older sister, Jamie Allan, and Katy’s younger sister, Lucy Marks, joined forces to help them bring their daughter Beatrix into the world. Lucy provided the egg while Jamie carried the baby for nine months. Sibling support: David and Katy Slade (back) with their surrogate baby Beatrix born from Katy's sister-in-law Jamie Allan (front right) using eggs donated by her sister Lucy Marks (front left) ‘If it wasn’t for our sisters we would. still be childless,’ said Mrs Slade, 31. ‘It’s the best gift ever and. we love them so much for it. I always knew I wanted to be a mother. It. was just a question of how.’ Mr Slade, 33, added: ‘We still can’t believe we are parents. We feel like the luckiest couple alive. ‘Beatrix is our little angel and we’ll forever be thankful to our sisters for making our dream come true.’ Mrs Slade, a primary school teacher,. has a genetic condition that means she has no reproductive organs. It. was diagnosed when she was a girl and she remembers tearfully telling. Lucy of her sorrow that she would never be a mother. It was then that Lucy promised to donate one of her own eggs when the time came. Years later, married and desperate to start a family, Mrs Slade asked her little sister if she had really meant what she said. Proud: David and Katy are the proud parents of a baby girl who was created with the help of their amazing sisters. Mother and daughter together: Katy and David decided to call her Beatrix - the middle name of the nan whose bequest financed their treatment. ‘I cried when Lucy said she would still donate her eggs for me,’ she recalled. ‘It meant that, genetically, the baby would be linked to both me and David.’ But Lucy, who had a boyfriend, and no children of her own, decided against carrying the baby for her sister as well. ‘We knew she wouldn’t be a surrogate too because the baby would feel too much like hers,’ Mrs Slade said. ‘It would have been hard for her to have her first pregnancy and then hand the baby to me.’ The Slades, who live in a £400,000. detached house in Romford, Essex, were reluctant to find a stranger to. act as a surrogate after hearing stories about women who demanded to. keep the baby at the last minute. But when Mr Slade told his older sister Jamie Allan, 35, about the problem she offered to help. Promise: Katy's sister Lucy (left) came to her aid by keeping a childhood promise to donate her eggs which were fertilised by David whose sister Jamie (right) then acted as a surrogate. Girl power: Katy Slade (centre) on her wedding day with her sister Lucy Marks (left) and sister in law Jamie Allan. After three children with her printer. husband, Wayne, she felt her family was complete and was sure she would. be able to happily hand the baby over after nine months of pregnancy. So the agreement was made. Mrs Slade’s. sister would provide the egg, Mr Slade would fertilise it and it would. be implanted into his sister, who would carry the baby. Our beautiful girl: Newborn baby Beatrix Eileen taking a bath. Over the next few months, Mr Slade’s. sperm was frozen, while his sister and sister-in-law were given hormone. injections – one to build the lining of her womb and the other to help. her produce more eggs to be harvested. Two embryos were implanted in. Jamie in December 2011 and she discovered she was pregnant on Christmas. Eve. The 20-week scan revealed the family were expecting one baby, a girl. She was named Beatrix and given the. second name Eileen – in honour of her great-grandmother, who had left a. bequest that paid for the £8,000 private IVF treatment. Beatrix was. born at Queen’s Hospital, Romford, on September 1 last year. Mrs Slade said: ‘I held her for the. first time and looked at Lucy, Jamie and David. It was incredible that. every single one of us had helped bring Beatrix into the world. ‘Beatrix is very much our own – our own little miracle.’ Lucy, a 27-year-old charity administrator, who lives with the Slades, said: ‘I just adore Beatrix, she’s absolutely wonderful. ‘But although my eggs were used to create her, she will always be my niece.’ Jamie, who runs an after-school club,. said: ‘Carrying the baby was something I was happy to do for them. I. knew that she wasn’t mine and I focused on that.’ Long search: Katy and David started exploring the possibility of finding a surrogate stranger - but were put off by stories of some who dropped out or became too attached to the baby, then there sisters came to the rescue.

The threat came as Taiwanese authorities quarantined hundreds at two hospitals amid fears of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome .","completion":"While the two sentences convey a similar message, they do not have precisely the same meaning. Both sentences mention authorities quarantining hundreds of people at two hospitals in Taiwan due to fears of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic. However, there are subtle differences between them that set them apart. First, let's examine the initial phrases of each sentence: 1. \\"The news came as authorities in Taiwan...\\" 2. \\"The threat came as Taiwanese authorities...\\" In the first sentence, the focus is on the \\"news\\" of the quarantine, implying that this information is something recently shared or announced. The second sentence focuses on the \\"threat\\" posed by the potential epidemic, emphasizing the danger of the situation. Moreover, the first sentence specifies that the mentioned authorities are \\"in Taiwan\\" while the second states that they are \\"Taiwanese authorities.\\" Next, let's look at the descriptions of the SARS epidemic: 1. \\"...fears of a widespread epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome on the self-governing island.\\" 2. \\"...fears of an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome.\\" The first sentence conveys a more detailed description of the epidemic, denoting that the situation may lead to a \\"widespread\\" epidemic of SARS on Taiwan, which it refers to as a \\"self-governing island.\\" In contrast, the second sentence provides a more concise picture of the epidemic fear without geographical details or the scope of the potential epidemic. Lastly, there's a minor difference in the way Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is presented in both sentences: 1. \\"...epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome...\\" 2. \\"...epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome...\\" The first sentence uses title case for \\"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,\\" whereas the second sentence uses sentence case for \\"severe acute respiratory syndrome.\\" Even though this difference in the format does not affect the meaning of the term, it suggests a variation in the structure and style between the two sentences. In conclusion, while the two sentences share a similar message about the quarantine of hundreds of people in Taiwan due to the risk of a SARS epidemic, they are not identical in their meaning and details."},{"prompt":"Q: Is this product review positive?

Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. and a hint : In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Please answer this question : Would Tanzania have thicker or thinner \\"A horizon\\" than Kenya?","completion":"Tanzania would have a thinner A horizon than Kenya due to the differences in their respective ecosystems and the factors influencing soil formation. In the Kenyan grassland ecosystem, the deep and fibrous root systems of the grasses contribute significantly to the soil's organic matter. The frequent occurrence of fires in the grasslands destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulates an even greater contribution from the roots. This enhanced root activity results in a more extensive addition and mixing of organic matter into the mineral soil. As a consequence, the A horizon, which is the topmost mineral layer that contains the highest amount of organic matter, becomes thicker. On the other hand, the Tanzanian forest ecosystem has a different process of soil formation. Tree leaves falling on the forest floor serve as the primary source of soil organic matter. However, the significantly greater acidity in forest ecosystems inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that would otherwise help mix the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the forest soils store most of their organic matter in the O horizon, which is the layer dominated by organic material derived from the decomposition of leaves and other plant residue. This leads to the formation of a thinner A horizon in Tanzanian forests compared to Kenyan grasslands. In conclusion, due to the differences in soil formation processes and the influence of environmental factors like acidity and root systems, Tanzania's A horizon would be thinner than Kenya's. This distinction between the two ecosystems highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay of factors shaping the soil profile in both grasslands and forests."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following conclusion? staying calm comes naturally Choose from: 1. Yes; 2. It's impossible to say; 3. No;","completion":"3. No Based on the information provided, staying calm does not appear to come naturally. It is essential to develop strategies and techniques to maintain control and calm in difficult or challenging situations. Here's a more detailed analysis of the topic: 1. Understand the importance of staying calm: Recognizing the benefits of staying calm can help you prioritize it in your life. When you are in control, you can make better decisions, communicate more clearly, and maintain healthier relationships. Moreover, it helps you regulate your emotions and prevent unnecessary stress. 2. Identify your triggers: To gain control and stay calm, begin by identifying situations or circumstances that may trigger your anxiety, stress, or agitation. This can vary from person to person—so, find what factors make you most vulnerable and address them before they have the chance to knock you off balance. 3. Develop self-calming techniques: Practice calming techniques such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization to build emotional resilience and self-control. Spend some time every day practicing these techniques to strengthen your ability to stay calm under pressure. 4. Use positive affirmations: Using positive affirmations helps reframe your mindset and reminds you of your ability to remain control. Statements like \\"I am calm and in control\\" or \\"I can handle this\\" can be reinforcing and empowering. 5. Focus on what you can control: In many situations, there are factors beyond our control. Instead of feeling overwhelmed or helpless, shift your focus and energy towards aspects you can manage– be it your response, attitude, or the way you approach a problem. 6. Create a supportive environment: Surround yourself with positive influences and aim to reduce sources of stress in your environment. This may include simplifying your surroundings, minimizing distractions, and spending time with people who support your growth and development. 7. Engage in mindfulness practices: Mindfulness techniques, like meditation, yoga, or simply being present, can help you develop greater self-awareness and self-control. With practice, you can better recognize when you need to regain your composure and can deploy the techniques that work best for you in those moments. 8. Embrace a growth mindset: Approach challenges and setbacks as opportunities to learn, grow, and improve. Understand that gaining control and staying calm is a journey and requires patience and persistence. In conclusion, staying calm does not come naturally to most people, but it can be achieved through practice, self-awareness, and a consistent effort to develop and employ self-calming techniques."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Determine the sentiment: (this may be a bit on the spoilerish side) I would like to start by saying I did not watch the entire movie, nor could I because it was evident from the first hour that I was going to be incredibly disappointed. That of course is the problem with taking, what many believe to be an amazing book, and turning it into a Disney Made-for-TV movie. A Wrinkle in Time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago. It's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults. Plus it's got built in quality sequels. But Disney-fying was not the way to go. The problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story dumbed down what was so great about the book. It is a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely \\"psychic\\", because that was the easiest way of explaining it. There was no reason to write a fight between the three Mrs. W's as added tension, there is enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses... that deprived us of what could've been a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that happens in the book. I could nitpick for days about little things, but I also think larger things, like the art direction was a off. Take for instance the way they made Camazotz look, with its strangely darkened skies. The creepiness that comes across in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like earth. It has people on it that look like humans. The skies are blue, the grass is green, and there are children playing. But something is a little bit off. The directors chose to make Camazotz a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the movie. The lesson of course is that Camazotz could very well be Earth, that is if we forget how to love. It would've been much creepier to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids bouncing the balls in the same rhythm. I unfortunately did not watch the end. Maybe someone can tell me how Disney messed up the end as well. Overall an artistic disappointment.","completion":"The person who wrote this feels disappointed and unhappy with the movie adaptation of \\"A Wrinkle in Time.\\" They think that the movie made changes that took away from the greatness of the book and that the movie could have been better if it stayed closer to the story in the book.

Joseph Rotblat, the only scientist to leave the Manhattan Project on moral grounds co-founded what Nobel Peace Prize winning organization that is named for a Canadian village?","completion":"Joseph Rotblat, a distinguished physicist and the only scientist to leave the Manhattan Project on moral grounds, co-founded the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. The organization was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995 for its efforts to diminish the part played by nuclear arms in international politics and, in the longer run, to eliminate such arms. Rotblat's departure from the Manhattan project was a decision influenced heavily by his ethical convictions. He was recruited to be part of the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, believing that it was crucial to prevent Nazi Germany from developing this weapon of mass destruction first. However, when he realized that Germany was not actually close to creating an atomic bomb, he decided to leave the project. He believed that using the atomic bomb against people, even in war, was ethically unjustifiable. His moral stance made him a notable figure in the scientific community. The Pugwash Conferences were originally a series of scientific conferences aimed at understanding and addressing the threats posed by nuclear weapons to humanity and the world. The idea for these conferences was conceived by Bertrand Russell (a philosopher and Nobel laureate) and Albert Einstein (a theoretical physicist) in the 1950s, as they recognized the destructive potential of nuclear technology when in the wrong hands, and the important role scientists must play in promoting peace and welfare globally. Rotblat was one of the first to join their cause. The organization gets its name from Pugwash, a small fishing village in Nova Scotia, Canada. The first conference was held in 1957 in the private estate of Cyrus Eaton, an American-born Canadian industrialist and philanthropist, in Pugwash. Cyrus Eaton, originally from Pugwash, had become concerned about the threat of nuclear war and had offered his hometown as a meeting place. Over the years, the conferences have attracted many scientists, scholars, and public figures from around the world, providing them a platform to discuss and engage in dialogue about the risks associated with nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and strategies to ensure global security and peace. The organization’s work was recognized when it, along with Joseph Rotblat, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995. While the organisation's initial focus was on nuclear disarmament, over time, the Pugwash Conferences have broadened their scope to include other threats to global security, such as chemical and biological weapons, war and conflicts, as well as social and economic disparities. Today, the Pugwash Conferences continue to promote global peace and security, following the vision set by its co-founders, including Joseph Rotblat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At first, Carmen wasn't really sure what was happening. In class, she had tosquint to see the blackboard clearly. As it got worse, she became more and more worried. It was important for her to see the notes and homework the teacher wrote on the board. In class, she asked for a desk that was closer to the blackboard. One day, her teacher said, \\"Carmen, I've noticed you squinting a lot.

Answer the following question: Process: - The liver filters blood from the digestive tract - The liver produces bile - The liver produces proteins for blood plasma - The liver converts excess glucose into glycogen for storage - The liver converts ammonia to urea - The liver regulates blood clotting. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no blood in the body happens, how will it affect the liver having to work SOFTER. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In the perturbation hypothesis you presented, where there is no blood within the body, the liver's functions would be significantly affected in several ways, both directly and indirectly. Here's a breakdown of how each process mentioned would be impacted: 1. Liver filtering blood from the digestive tract: Without blood in the body, the liver would not be able to filter the blood from the digestive tract. This is a direct effect, as this filtering process is essential in detoxifying and purifying the blood. Without blood to process, this purification function would be rendered non-existent. 2. Liver producing bile: Bile production could be indirectly affected by the lack of blood as bile production requires energy, and some materials, like amino acids, are transported via the blood. Without blood, the liver may not receive the necessary materials and signals for normal bile production, which would disrupt its role in breaking down and absorbing dietary fats. 3. Liver producing proteins for blood plasma: Since there's no blood to contain the blood plasma, the liver would not need to synthesize proteins for blood plasma. This is a direct effect of the lack of blood, as the liver's production of blood plasma proteins like albumin and clotting factors will have no purpose. 4. Liver converting excess glucose into glycogen for storage: With no blood available to transport glucose to the liver, the liver may not have a surplus of glucose to convert into glycogen for storage. This would be an indirect effect, as the liver's glucose regulation depends on blood to supply it with this vital resource. 5. Liver converting ammonia to urea: As the liver cannot convert ammonia to urea without proper blood supply, this process would also be directly affected by the absence of blood. The liver relies on blood to deliver ammonia, a toxic substance generated during the breakdown of proteins, which the liver then converts into urea to be excreted by the kidneys. 6. Liver regulating blood clotting: The liver's ability to regulate blood clotting by producing coagulation proteins will be directly affected, as there is no blood available to clot. Consequently, this function would become unnecessary and irrelevant. To summarize, if there were no blood in the body, the liver's ability to perform essential functions would be substantially disrupted, with both direct and indirect effects on various processes. The liver would not be able to carry out its vital roles, leading to severe consequences for the overall function of the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh.

To find the value of m, we need to get m by itself on one side of the equation. Currently, it's being multiplied by -57. To cancel out this multiplication, let's divide both sides of the equation by -57: 1140 / (-57) = -57m / (-57) Step 4: Perform the division. 1140 / (-57) = -20 So, we have: -20 = m The value of m is -20."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Battle of Vågen was a naval battle between a Dutch merchant and treasure fleet and an English flotilla of warships in August 1665 as part of the Second Anglo-Dutch War. The battle took place in Vågen (meaning \\"the bay, voe\\" in Norwegian), the main port area of neutral Bergen, Norway. Due to a delay in orders the Norwegian commanders took the side of the Dutch, contrary to the secret intentions of the King of Norway and Denmark. The battle ended with the defeat of the English fleet, which retreated, much damaged but without losing any ships. The treasure fleet was relieved by the Dutch home fleet seventeen days later. - The Second Anglo-Dutch War (4 March 1665 31 July 1667) was a conflict fought between England and the United Provinces for control over the seas and trade routes, where England tried to end the Dutch domination of world trade during a period of intense European commercial rivalry. After initial English successes, the war ended in a Dutch victory. It was part of a series of four Anglo-Dutch Wars fought between the English (later British) and the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries. - The Baroque (or ) is often thought of as a period of artistic style that used exaggerated motion and clear, easily interpreted detail to produce drama, tension, exuberance, and grandeur in sculpture, painting, architecture, literature, dance, theater, and music. The style began around 1600 in Rome and Italy, and spread to most of Europe. - The War on Terror (WoT), also known as the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT), is a metaphor of war referring to the international military campaign that started after the September 11 attacks on the United States.<ref name = \\"Schmitt/slogan\\"></ref> U.S. President George W. Bush first used the term \\"\\"War on Terror\\"\\" on 20 September 2001. The Bush administration and the western media have since used the term to argue a global military, political, legal, and conceptual struggle against both organizations designated terrorist and regimes accused of supporting them. It was originally used with a particular focus on countries associated with Islamic terrorism organizations including al-Qaeda and like-minded organizations. - Christen Nielsen Holberg ( aka . Christian Holberg ) was an officer in the Norwegian Army . He was also the father of Ludvig Holberg . In 1653 he was hired as a lieutenant to serve with Bergenhusiske Regiment both in Bergenhus len and on Bergenhus Fortress In 1659 he was appointed commander of Sundfjordske Kompani of Bergenhusiske Regiment with the rank of captain . During the Bjelke War he and his company participated in the defence of Halden against the Swedes . On August 2 , 1665 he participated in the Battle of Vågen as a Major . In 1672 he was a lieutenant colonel in the Sundfjordske Kompani . In 1675 he was a member of the regimental staff and the commander of Sognske Kompani . During the Gyldenløve War he was given the responsibility of raising two new companies for the regiment before joining it in Sweden in 1676 where he participated in the siege of Bohus Fortress . Upon returning to Norway later that year he was sent back to Bergen to be temporary commander of Bergenhus Fortress in the place of Johan Caspar von Cicignon . In 1679 he left the service of Bergenhusiske Regiment . - A soldier is one who fights as part of an organised, land-based armed force. A soldier can be an enlisted person, a non-commissioned officer, or an officer. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Ludvig Holberg, Baron of Holberg (3 December 1684 28 January 1754) was a writer, essayist, philosopher, historian and playwright born in Bergen, Norway, during the time of the Dano-Norwegian double monarchy. He was influenced by Humanism, the Enlightenment and the Baroque. Holberg is considered the founder of modern Danish and Norwegian literature, and is best known for the comedies he wrote in 17221723 for the Lille Grønnegade Theatre in Copenhagen. Holberg's works about natural and common law were widely read by many Danish law students over two hundred years, from 1736 to 1936. - Trondheim, historically Kaupangen, Nidaros and Trondhjem, is a city and municipality in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. It has a population of 187,353 (January 1, 2016), and is the third most populous municipality in Norway, although the fourth largest urban area. It is the third largest city in the country, with a population (2013) of 169,972 inhabitants within the city borders. The city functions as the administrative centre of Sør-Trøndelag county. Trondheim lies on the south shore of Trondheim Fjord at the mouth of the river Nidelva. The city is dominated by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), the Foundation for Scientific and Industrial Research (SINTEF), St. Olavs University Hospital and other technology-oriented institutions. - Humanism is a philosophical and ethical stance that emphasizes the value and agency of human beings, individually and collectively, and affirms their ability to improve their lives through the use of reason and ingenuity as opposed to submitting blindly to tradition and authority or sinking into cruelty and brutality. The term was coined in 1808 by the early nineteenth century German educational reformer and theologian Friedrich Niethammer and gradually adopted into English. Niethammer had wished to introduce into German education the humane values of ancient Greece and Rome. Niethhammer was a Lutheran theologian. Since the twentieth century, however, Anglophone humanist movements have usually been aligned with secularism, and today humanism typically refers to a non-theistic life stance centred on human agency and looking to science rather than revelation from a supernatural source to understand the world. - Norwegian literature is literature composed in Norway or by Norwegian people. The history of Norwegian literature starts with the pagan Eddaic poems and skaldic verse of the 9th and 10th centuries with poets such as Bragi Boddason and Eyvindr Skáldaspillir. The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European medieval learning, hagiography and history writing. Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence this was to flower into an active period of literature production in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Major works of that period include \\"Historia Norwegie\\", \\"Thidreks saga\\" and \\"Konungs skuggsjá.\\" - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. - Johan Caspar von Cicignon (c. 1625 - 12 December 1696) was a Luxembourg-born soldier and military engineer who spent most of his career in the service of DenmarkNorway.

On the way, the plane made a one-hour stop to refuel at the New York Airport. Thinking that he had arrived, Jack got out and spent three days in New York, believing he was in Rome. When his s were not there to meet him, Jack thought they had been caught in the heavy Roman traffic mentioned in their letters. While looking for their address, Jack could not help noticing that modernization had changed most, if not all, of the ancient city's landmarks. He also noticed that many people spoke English with strong American accent. However, he just thought that Americans got everywhere. He also believed that so many street signs were written in English especially for the Americans. Jack spoke very little English himself so he asked a policeman in Italian the way to the bus station. As chance would have it, the policeman came from Italy and replied in the same language. After twelve hours traveling round on a bus, the driver handed him over to a second policeman. After brief argument with the policeman, Jack was very surprised to find that the Rome police had employed someone who did not speak his mother tongue. Jack did not believe he was told that he was in New York.

I can't say I'm all that experienced in misty Mundae flicks having seen only a handful, but it's obvious that this was made on a shoestring, and while it might have been respectable that the filmmakers were able to make a Tomb Raider rip-off inside a garage, it isn't because it's completely obvious that this is what they were doing. The film only runs for forty five minutes, and this is definitely a good thing as there isn't nearly enough plot here to stretch it out for any longer. It has something to do with an evil Nazi scientist (who looks about as evil as a porn star playing a Nazi scientist ever could), a mummy, which is clearly a man wrapped up in toilet roll and Misty - this film's version of Tomb Raider, who keeps her top on for much less time than Angelina Jolie did in the big budget version. I have to say that even in spite of its shortcomings, this film could have been better. It's got Misty Mundae for a start, and even better than that if you ask me is the fact that it also stars the even hotter Darian Caine. The pair gets to engage in all the lesbian sex that you would expect from a Seduction Cinema film and this is at the expense of the nonexistent plot, although that isn't really a bad thing. Obviously, this is a rubbish film - but the fact that it's short is to its credit, and if you're after a bit of lesbian sex, you could do worse.

While the reviewer acknowledges certain aspects that might appeal to some viewers, such as the presence of Misty Mundae and Darian Caine and the lesbian scenes, they also point out obvious low production quality, a lack of plot, and the film being a blatant Tomb Raider rip-off made on a shoestring budget. The reviewer also appreciates the short runtime, but it can be inferred that it is mainly because they don't think the film could sustain a longer duration due to the lack of plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Input: Passage: Past problems with hydraulic elevators include underground electrolytic destruction of the cylinder and bulkhead, pipe failures, and control failures. Single bulkhead cylinders, typically built prior to a 1972 ASME A17.1 Elevator Safety Code change requiring a second dished bulkhead, were subject to possible catastrophic failure. The code previously permitted only single-bottom hydraulic cylinders. In the event of a cylinder breach, the fluid loss results in uncontrolled down movement of the elevator. This creates two significant hazards: being subject to an impact at the bottom when the elevator stops suddenly and being in the entrance for a potential shear if the rider is partly in the elevator. Because it is impossible to verify the system at all times, the code requires periodic testing of the pressure capability. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a plunger gripping device. One commercially available is known by the marketing name \\"LifeJacket\\". This is a device which, in the event of an uncontrolled downward acceleration, nondestructively grips the plunger and stops the car. A device known as an overspeed or rupture valve is attached to the hydraulic inlet/outlet of the cylinder and is adjusted for a maximum flow rate. If a pipe or hose were to break (rupture), the flow rate of the rupture valve will surpass a set limit and mechanically stop the outlet flow of hydraulic fluid, thus stopping the plunger and the car in the down direction.

For Sebastian, there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship San Cristobal, which sank somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a lot of treasure. Sebastian believes that if he finds this treasure, this will give him and his girlfriend the opportunity to live a better life.Sebastian hangs out with his friend and employee Mace (Michael Graziadei) and his girlfriend Kimi (Mircea Monroe), Dani's best friend, who are a couple that have a difficult relationship because Mace tends to flirt with other women.

The official said two Iraqi soldiers carried out the attack on military trainers and then were detained. In another incident, the U.S. military said an American service member was killed while conducting operations in the central region of the country. The last American deaths occurred on January 2, when two U.S. service members died in Taji after insurgents attacked their unit with an improvised explosive device. In September, an Iraqi soldier opened fire on a group of U.S. soldiers near Tuz in northern Iraq, killing two and wounding nine others. That shooting occurred inside an Iraqi army commando compound, and the attacker was shot and killed. U.S. troop deaths in Iraq have dropped greatly in recent years as many American forces have departed the country and local security forces have led the effort to thwart violence in Iraq. There are more than 650,000 uniformed Iraqi personnel -- army and police -- in Iraq, according to the International Crisis Group.

Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\". Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing \\"creative differences\\".Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

They are not true bone structures but they usually grow in symmetrical pairs. In most species, only the male grows antlers and the antlers primarily function in sexual selection as attractions to females and as weapons in fights for control of harems. In many temperate zone species, antlers are shed and regrow each year, while horns are permanent. - Deer (singular and plural) are the ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. The two main groups are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the fallow deer and the chital, and the Capreolinae, including the elk, reindeer (caribou), the Western roe deer, and the Eurasian elk (moose). Female reindeer, and male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer), grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from permanently horned antelope, which are in the same order, Artiodactyla. - The Capreolinae, Odocoileinae, or the New World deer are a subfamily of deer. Alternatively, they are known as the telemetacarpal deer, due to their bone structure being different from the plesiometacarpal deer subfamily Cervinae. The telemetacarpal deer maintain their distal lateral metacarpals, while the plesiometacarpal deer maintain only their proximal lateral metacarpals. The Capreolinae are believed to have originated in the Late Miocene, between 7.7 and 11.5 million years ago, in central Asia. - The chital or cheetal (\\"Axis axis\\"), also known as spotted deer or axis deer, is a deer found in the Indian subcontinent. The species was first described by German naturalist Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. A moderate-sized deer, male chital reach nearly and females at the shoulder. While males weigh , the lighter females weigh . The species is sexually dimorphic: males are larger than females, and antlers are present only on males. The upper parts are golden to rufous, completely covered in white spots. The abdomen, rump, throat, insides of legs, ears and tail are all white. The antlers, three-pronged, are nearly long. - The European roe deer (\\"Capreolus capreolus\\"), also known as the western roe deer, \\"chevreuil\\", or simply roe deer, is an Eurasian species of deer. The male of the species is sometimes referred to as a roebuck. The roe deer is relatively small, reddish and grey-brown, and well-adapted to cold environments. The species is widespread in Europe, from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia and from Britain to the Caucasus. It is distinct from the somewhat larger Siberian roe deer. - Cephenemyiini is a tribe within the family Oestridae which includes large flies , parasitic on deer and related ungulates . Tribe Cephenemyiini Genus Cephenemyia Latreille , 1818 C. apicata Bennett and Sabrosky , 1962 C. auribarbis ( Meigen , 1824 ) C. grandis C. jellisoni Townsend , 1941 C. kaplanovi C. macrostis Brauer , 1863 C. phobifer ( Clark , 1815 ) C. pratti ( Clark , 1815 ) C. stimulator Hunter , 1916 C. trompe ( Modeer , 1786 ) C. ulrichii Brauer , 1863 Genus Pharyngomyia Schiner , 1861 P. picta ( Meigen , 1824 ) - Muntjacs, also known as barking deer and Mastreani deer, are small deer of the genus \\"Muntiacus\\". Muntjacs are the oldest known deer, thought to have begun appearing 1535 million years ago, with remains found in Miocene deposits in France, Germany and Poland. - The elk, or wapiti (\\"Cervus canadensis\\"), is one of the largest species within the deer family, Cervidae, in the world, and one of the largest land mammals in North America and Eastern Asia. This animal should not be confused with the still larger moose (\\"Alces alces\\") to which the name \\"elk\\" applies in British English and in reference to populations in Eurasia. Apart from the moose, the only other member of the deer family to rival the elk in size is the south Asian sambar (\\"Rusa unicolor\\"). - The water deer (\\"Hydropotes inermis\\") is a small deer superficially more similar to a musk deer than a true deer. Native to China and Korea, there are two subspecies: the Chinese water deer (\\"Hydropotes inermis inermis\\") and the Korean water deer (\\"Hydropotes inermis argyropus\\"). Despite its lack of antlers and certain other anatomical anomaliesincluding a pair of prominent tusks (downward-pointing canine teeth), it is classified as a cervid. Its unique anatomical characteristics have caused it to be classified in its own genus (Hydropotes) as well as its own subfamily (Hydropotinae). However, a study of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences placed it near \\"Capreolus\\" within an Old World section of the subfamily Capreolinae. Its prominent tusks (elongated canines), similar to those of musk deer, have led to both being colloquially named vampire deer in English-speaking areas to which they have been imported. The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The reindeer (\\"Rangifer tarandus\\"), also known as caribou in North America, is a species of deer with circumpolar distribution, native to Arctic, Subarctic, tundra, boreal and mountainous regions of northern Europe, Siberia, and North America. This includes both sedentary and migratory populations. - The fallow deer (\\"Dama dama\\") is a ruminant mammal belonging to the family Cervidae. This common species is native to western Eurasia, but has been introduced to Antigua & Barbuda, Argentina, South Africa, Fernando Pó, São Tomé, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Réunion, Seychelles, Comoro Islands, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Cyprus, Israel, Cape Verde, Lebanon, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the Falkland Islands and Peru. Some taxonomers include the rarer Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (\\"D. d. mesopotamica\\"), while others treat it as an entirely different species (\\"D. mesopotamica\\"). - The Cervinae or the Old World deer (denoting their place of origin, not their current distribution), are a subfamily of deer. Alternatively, they are known as the plesiometacarpal deer, due to their ankle structure being different from the telemetecarpal deer of the Capreolinae. - An antelope is a member of a number of even-toed ungulate species indigenous to various regions in Africa and Eurasia. Antelopes comprise a wastebasket taxon (miscellaneous group) within the family Bovidae, encompassing those Old World species that are not cattle, sheep, buffalo, bison, or goats. A group of antelope is called a herd. What is the relationship between 'cephenemyiini' and 'subfamily'? A:","completion":"Cephenemyiini is a tribe within the family Oestridae, which includes large flies that are parasitic on deer and related ungulates. The term 'subfamily' in this context refers to a taxonomic rank within the hierarchical classification of biological organisms. A subfamily is a subdivision within a family, which in turn is a division within an order. In the case of deer, the subfamilies mentioned are Capreolinae (the New World deer or telemetacarpal deer) and Cervinae (the Old World deer or plesiometacarpal deer). The relationship between Cephenemyiini and 'subfamily' lies in the fact that both are taxonomic ranks used to classify organisms. While Cephenemyiini is a tribe (a classification rank between family and genus) that focuses on large flies parasitic on deer, the term 'subfamily' represents a more general classification rank within a family. In the context of deer, subfamilies help to further categorize the different types of deer based on their anatomical differences and geographical origins."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Many people seem to think that science fiction is typified by the Bug-eyed Monster, embodying every feature that most people find unpleasant. This is unfortunate because it degrades a worthwhile literary endeavor. Instead, the basic interest of science fiction lies in the relation between man and his technology and between man and the universe. Science fiction is a literature of change and a literature of the future, and the aspects of human life that it considers make it well worth reading and studying for no other literary form does quite the same things. What is science fiction? To begin, the following definition should be helpful: science fiction is a literary subgenre which postulates(...) a change (for human beings) from conditions as we know them and follows the implications of these changes to a conclusion. The first point that science fiction is a literary subgenre is a very important one, but one which is often overlooked. Specifically, science fiction is either a short story or a novel. There are only a few dramas which could be called science fiction; the body of poetry that might be labeled science fiction is only slightly larger. To say that science fiction is a subgenre of prose fiction is to say that it has all the basic characteristics and serves the same basic functions in much the same way as prose fiction in general, that is, it shares a great deal with all other novels and short stories. Everything that can be said about prose fiction, in general, applies to science fiction. Every piece of science fiction, whether short story or novel, must have a narrator, a story, a plot, characters, setting, and language. The themes of science fiction are concerned with interpreting man's nature and experience around him. Themes in science fiction are constructed and presented in exactly the same ways that themes are dealt with in any other kind of fiction. They are the result to a particular combination of a narrator, story, plot, character, setting, and language. In short, the reasons for reading...

Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfill ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, as are the kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved to protect them from the extinct moa.

Answer a question about this article: Matisse was also one of the first 20th-century artists to make color the central element of the painting, chosen to evoke emotions. \\"A certain blue penetrates your soul\\", he wrote. \\"A certain red affects your blood pressure.\\" He also was familiar with the way that complementary colors, such as red and green, strengthened each other when they were placed next to each other. He wrote, \\"My choice of colors is not based on scientific theory; it is based on observation, upon feelings, upon the real nature of each experience ... I just try to find a color which corresponds to my feelings.\\" What part in the paintings of Matisse did color play?","completion":"In the paintings of Henri Matisse, color played a crucial and central role as it was used to evoke emotions and express the artist's feelings. Matisse, being one of the first 20th-century artists to prioritize color, broke away from conventional artistic norms by focusing on the emotional impact of color rather than its mere representation of the subject matter. Matisse understood the power of individual colors to influence human emotions and responses, such as how \\"a certain blue penetrates your soul\\" or \\"a certain red affects your blood pressure.\\" By consciously using these colors, he was able to create distinct moods and atmospheres within his paintings that resonated with viewers on an emotional level. In addition to his understanding of the emotional properties of individual colors, Matisse also grasped the concept of complementary colors and their ability to strengthen each other when placed side by side. These combinations, such as red and green, allowed him to achieve visual harmony, balance, and vibrancy within his compositions. Contrary to relying on scientific theory, Matisse's choice of colors was based on observation, feelings, and his personal experiences. His priority lay in finding colors that corresponded with his emotions, allowing him to create a unique and authentic connection with the viewer. This approach to color became a key aspect of Matisse's signature style and greatly influenced the development of modern art, including movements such as Fauvism and Abstract Expressionism. In summary, color played an essential part in Matisse's paintings as it acted as a tool for evoking emotions, communicating personal feelings, and creating a visual language that went beyond the traditional representation of the physical world. By harnessing the power of color, Matisse forged a new artistic path that challenged conventional norms and left a lasting impact on the world of modern art."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The two burglars knocked on a side door of the museum at about 1:15 am. They told the two security guards on duty that there was a disturbance in the area. The guards then made the very serious mistake of allowing the two men to go into the building. After they went in, the two burglars tied the guards up with tape. The two men stole 11 paintings and an ancient Chinese vase. The stolen works included three paintings by Rembrandt. A maintenance worker discovered the two guards at about 7 am and called police. One of the greatest losses was Rembrandt's works, \\"The Storm on the Sea of Galilee.\\" It was a very popular attraction at the museum and was one of the most valuable works stolen. Museum officials said that the value of the stolen art is at least 200 million dollars, and may in fact be much more. The true value of the paintings is unknown, because they have not been on the market for nearly a century. This is considered to be the biggest theft ever in the United States. Officials are waiting to see whether the burglars will or try to sell them to a private collector. Museum officials and police are not sure why the burglars chose certain works and not others. There are other paintings in the museum that are even more valuable than the ones that were stolen. Special investigators are looking into the theft and the museum's security system.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ex-White Plains cop shot daughters while they slept: police He killed his daughters while they lay sleeping. That horrific revelation emerged Monday as police provided fresh details about the tragic double-murder of two teenage girls by their father, retired White Plains Police Officer Glen Hochman, who then killed himself with a bullet to the head. “There were no signs of a struggle, indicating they were killed in their sleep,” said Chief Anthony Marraccini of the Harrison, N.Y. police department. After fatally shooting 17-year-old Alissa Hochman and her 13-year-old sister, Deanna, in the head, the ex-cop dispatched the three family dogs, Marraccini said. “It’s not clear why he killed the dogs,” he said. Hochman then headed to the garage of his Harrison, N.Y., house and shot himself sometime after 2 a.m. Saturday, the chief said. A .40-caliber Glock was still in Hochman’s hand when he was found, along with a typed, five-to-six-page suicide letter addressed to his wife, Anamarie Hochman. “The primary note was one page with instructions on what Mrs. Hochman needed to do to get things in order,” Marraccini said. Hochman, who was 52, explained in the letter why “the two girls were taken away,” the chief said. Marraccini declined to divulge the details of what Hochman wrote. “The wife was shocked at the event,” he said. “I’m not sure that anybody can even understand how a person kills his children. It’s something that’s not comprehensible to me.” When asked about a possible motive, the chief said there had been “marital issues” and “a family discussion about a possible separation.” “I could probably say that it could be a factor in the incident,” he said. But no divorce papers had been filed and there was no history of domestic violence or psychiatric problems with the family. The Hochmans also did not appear to have money problems. Still, a day before the killings, Hochman’s wife had gone to the police to report an argument over an 80 cellphone bill. “She didn't want us to pursue it, she just wanted to document it,” the chief said. “There was no prior indication that Mr. Hochman would have committed this heinous act.” Then Anamarie Hochman and oldest daughter, Samantha, unaware that their lives were about to take a tragic turn, took off on a planned trip to the Mohegan Sun resort in Connecticut. Marraccini said that when Hochman’s wife called home Saturday and couldn’t raise anybody, she phoned Alissa’s boyfriend and asked him to go over to the house on Adelphi Ave. He did not identify the young man. Using the pass code he’d been given, the boyfriend entered the garage and found Hochman. It was only after the cops arrived that he learned his girlfriend had been killed, police said. Hochman, who served on the White Plains force for 22 years, was a decorated police officer with a reputation as a reliable cop. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO.

Write some highlights for the following article: Cris Carter, the Hall of Fame wide receiver and ESPN analyst opened up about his own upbringing in relation to the child-abuse charge brought against Adrian Peterson, as he applauded his former team's decision to drop the star on Sunday. Carter, who played 12 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, said he was proud they sidelined Peterson for the game against the New England Patriots, who crushed them, 30-7. 'My mom did the best job she could do raising seven kids by herself, but there are thousands of things that I have learned since then that my mom was wrong,' Carter said. 'It's the 21st century - my mom was wrong. She did the best she could but she was wrong about some of that stuff she taught me and I promised my kids I won't teach that mess to them.' Scroll down for video. Cris Carter emotionally discussed his upbringing on Sunday while talking about Adrian Peterson's child-abuse charge with his colleagues on 'NFL Countdown'. He said his mother did the best she could but she got some things wrong, and he didn't want to pass them onto his children. 'Take him off the field,' he said, slapping his hand against the desk during 'NFL Countdown'. “The only thing I’m proud about is the team that I played for, they did the right thing.' A grand jury in Texas indicted Peterson on Thursday on a charge of reckless or negligent injury to a child, his four-year-old son, whom he spanked with a leafless tree branch in May as a punishment. The 29-year-old surrendered to authorities on Saturday after a warrant was issued for his arrest, and he was freed on 15,000 bail. Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson gets a kiss from his son Adrian Jr at the end of practice at NFL football training camp in 2013.

Carter and his colleagues on 'NFL Countdown' also talked about Greg Hardy, the defensive end of the Carolina Panthers, who was found guilty in July of assaulting and threatening his ex-girlfriend. The Panthers placed Hardy on the inactive list for the game today against the Detroit Lions. 'How could you allow Greg Hardy on the field?' asked ESPN analyst and former Denver Broncos linebacker Tom Jackson. 'Due process has played out. He's convicted. He's appealing. We know the facts of the case. They're undisputed.' Jackson added: 'At least in this instance, Mr. Richardson and the Carolina Panthers got this right for this moment.' Jerry Richardson, owner of the Carolina Panthers, earlier in the week broke down in tears as he discussed the league's growing troubles with some of its players involvement in domestic abuse, USA Today reported. 'When it comes to domestic violence, my stance is not one of indifference. I stand firmly against domestic violence, plain and simple. To those that would suggest we have been too slow to act, I ask that you consider not to be too quick to judge,' Richardson said as he accepted the Echo Foundation Award Against Violence in Charlotte. 'Over the course of our 20 years, we have worked extremely hard to build an organization of integrity and earn the trust of our community. I work hard to continue to earn the trust, and I thank you for this award,' he said.

Dorothy Dandridge was born on November 9, 1922 in Cleveland, Ohio, to aspiring entertainer Ruby Dandridge (nee Butler) (March 3, 1900 - October 17, 1987) and Cyril Dandridge (October 25, 1895 - July 9, 1989), a cabinetmaker and Baptist minister, who had separated just before her birth. Ruby created a song-and-dance act for her two young daughters, Vivian and Dorothy, under the name The Wonder Children, that was managed by Geneva Williams. The sisters toured the Southern United States almost nonstop for five years (rarely attending school), while Ruby worked and performed in Cleveland. In 1957, Dandridge sued Confidential (magazine) for libel over its article that described a scandalous incident, fictitious as it turned out, that it claimed occurred in 1950. In May 1957, she accepted an out-of-court settlement of 10,000. Dandridge was one of the few Hollywood stars who testified at the 1957 criminal libel trial of Hollywood Research, Inc., the company that published Confidential as well as all of the other tabloid magazines from that era. Four months after her out-of-court settlement for 10,000, she and actress Maureen O'Hara, the only other star who testified at the criminal trial, were photographed shaking hands outside the downtown-Los Angeles courtroom where the highly publicized trial was held. Testimony from O'Hara, as well as from a disgruntled former magazine editor named Howard Rushmore, revealed that the magazines published false information provided by hotel maids, clerks, and movie-theater ushers who were paid for their tips. The stories with questionable veracity most often centered around alleged incidents of casual sex. When the jury and press visited Grauman's Chinese Theatre to determine whether O'Hara could have performed various sexual acts while seated in the balcony, as reported by a magazine published by Hollywood Research, Inc., this was discovered to have been impossible. Dandridge had not testified during her civil lawsuit earlier in 1957, but in September she gave testimony in the criminal trial that further strengthened the prosecution's case. Alleged by Confidential to have fornicated with a white bandleader in the woods of Lake Tahoe in 1950, she testified that racial segregation had confined her to her hotel during her nightclub engagement in the Nevada resort city. When she was not in the hotel lounge rehearsing or performing her singing, according to her testimony, she was required to stay inside her room where she slept alone. Dandridge's testimony along with O'Hara's testimony proved beyond any doubt that Hollywood Research had committed libel at least twice. The judge ordered Hollywood Research to stop publishing questionable stories based on tips for which they paid, and this curtailed invasive tabloid journalism until 1971 when Generoso Pope, Jr. moved the National Enquirer, which he owned, from New York to Lantana, Florida. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what was their biggest accomplishment?","completion":"It is difficult to pinpoint a single biggest accomplishment for Dorothy Dandridge based on the provided information. However, one could argue that her groundbreaking career as an African-American actress in Hollywood, during a time when the industry was highly segregated, was a significant accomplishment. Dandridge became the first Black woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the 1954 film, \\"Carmen Jones.\\" Additionally, standing up for herself and ultimately winning a libel lawsuit against Confidential magazine was another significant accomplishment. Dandridge and Maureen O'Hara's testimonies in the criminal libel trial in 1957 revealed that Hollywood Research, Inc. had published false information, leading to a change in the tabloid journalism industry and putting an end to invasive and unethical practices for a period of time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Where would he go to plug in? Possible A: toy store, basement, school, rest area, building Why is \\"rest area\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"The answer \\"rest area\\" is aligned with human common sense because it takes into consideration the context of the question and the circumstances that would typically be associated with the scenario. In the question, John needs electricity to cook lunch in his RV. Usually, RVs (Recreational Vehicles) are used for traveling and require a suitable place for parking and accessing necessary utilities such as water, electricity, and waste disposal. While toy stores, basements, and schools are unlikely to offer such facilities for RVs, rest areas and some buildings may provide suitable alternatives. Rest areas, also known as highway rest stops or service areas, are common along major roads and highways. They are designed to provide travelers a place to park, take a break, and access facilities such as restrooms, picnic tables, and vending machines. Many rest areas also have dedicated spaces with electrical hookups for RVs to park and connect to the power supply. Considering the question's context, these areas are the logical and convenient choice for John's needs in his RV. In contrast, the other options provided do not align with human common sense for the following reasons: 1. Toy store: A toy store is a place where toys, games, and other recreational items are sold. It is not a location where an RV would typically be able to access electrical hookups and the facilities required for cooking a meal. 2. Basement: A basement is an enclosed space below a building. Given the size and layout of most basements, it would not be a practical or suitable place for an RV to access the necessary utilities. 3. School: A school is an educational institution meant for academic purposes. Although some schools may have parking lots, it is uncommon for them to provide facilities tailored to RVs, such as electrical hookups. 4. Building: While some buildings may offer parking and utility options for RVs, this term is too broad and does not provide a clear indication of the type of building that would accommodate John's needs. Rest areas, however, are specifically designed to cater to travelers on the road, making them better suited for John's situation. In conclusion, the answer \\"rest area\\" aligns with human common sense because it takes into account the scenario's context, and it is a practical choice when considering the needs of an individual with an RV. Rest areas are specifically designed for the purpose of providing travelers with the facilities they need, including access to electricity, which is required for John to cook his lunch."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Sergio Goya / dpa / Corbis A woman counts euros and dollars Nov. 11, 2010. The U.S. Federal Reserve has been pumping billions of dollars into the European banking system in recent weeks in an attempt to help stabilize the continent’s financial crisis. And while the effort remains small, it is likely to grow in coming days as Europe’s banks struggle to find lenders willing to help them service their dollar denominated debts. The Fed’s effort has two parts. The largest by far is its provision of dollars through swap lines the Fed opened to other central banks around the world during the 2008 financial crisis, and reopened in May 2010 when the European sovereign debt crisis blew up. According to the agreement [PDF] signed between the New York Fed and the European Central Bank, the ECB can swap Euros for dollars at a fixed exchange rate and repay the Fed with nominal interest at an agreed upon date. For months the swap lines remained idle, but last September the European Central Bank announced it would tap them to help provide dollars to banks in Europe, and it began rolling over about 500 million worth of swaps every 7 days at a little over 1% annualized interest. In mid-October the ECB increased its swaps, drawing 1.35 billion for three months, while continuing to rollover the previous 500 million. Over the following weeks it swapped another 1 billion in 1-week and three-month paper, bringing the outstanding total to 2.35 billion as of Nov. 16. That is a tiny amount in the multi-trillion dollar world of transatlantic money flows, and it shows that in some ways the Fed move to ensure its vast store of dollars are available to the European banks through this channel is working. “The hope is that when you put the big bazooka [of Fed dollars] on the table that you don’t have to use it,” the source says. But the uptick in swap line use shows it is becoming harder for European banks to get their hands on dollars from lenders, and suggests, as the source says, that at some point the bazooka “may have to be used.” Since the Nov. 16 report on swaps was released by the New York Fed, interbank lending in Europe has further worsened. The European banks are trying hard to avoid using the second measure the Fed has made available to some of them: drawing off the discount window in the U.S. Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed’s discount window has remained open to all U.S. banks, and to all foreign banks that have branches or agencies here. Virtually no one is currently drawing on that source—there was 4 million outstanding as of Nov. 16—because it is a sign of ultimate collapse for a bank to have to do so. For all the Fed’s willingness to back-stop European banks there is only so much it can do. The European banks’ problems are not primarily with their dollar-denominated debts, but with their Euro debts. They are currently drawing 500 billion Euros off the ECB in an effort to service their debts. In recent weeks, Italian and other banks have pushed the ECB to accept less reliable forms of collateral for loans they take from the ECB. The ECB in the past has accepted such collateral, down to office furniture, for countries receiving help from the IMF, but is only now loosening the restrictions for bigger countries like Italy. With the loosened requirements, the ECB has the potential capacity to lend 14 trillion Euros. The Fed’s effort is a worthwhile risk since the U.S. has a huge economic interest in keeping dollars available worldwide. The U.S. has 1.28 trillion in exports every year, and the vast majority of those purchases are made in dollars—ensuring there are enough dollars in circulation to keep that commerce going is important. Likewise the discount window protects the flow of dollars at home: in 2006 foreign banking institutions held around 18% of U.S. commercial and industrial loans. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) is trying to help European banks by providing them with billions of dollars to stabilize their financial crisis. They do this using something called \\"swap lines\\" which allows the European Central Bank (ECB) to exchange Euros for dollars at a fixed rate. This helps European banks as they struggle to find lenders who can help them with their dollar debts. One reason the Fed is helping European banks is that the U.S. has a big interest in making sure there are enough dollars available worldwide. This is important for trade and commerce. However, there are limits to how much the Fed can do, as European banks have more problems with their Euro debts than their dollar debts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The Chinese project N635 entails the construction of a large canal from the upper reaches of the Irtysh to Ulyungur Lake. This project is a significant engineering endeavor from China. The Irtysh River, which originates from the Mongolian Altai mountains, is one of the longest rivers passing through Kazakhstan and Russia, and finally draining into the Arctic Ocean. It is also one of the two rivers in the world that crosses national boundaries, which makes it unique and its use, a subject of international importance. China's ambitious N635 project plans to divert water from the upper reaches of the Irtysh to the Ulyungur lake. Ulyungur lake, located in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in China, needs water replenishment for its ecological maintenance and balance. This large canal construction serves multiple purposes. It aims to ensure the supply of fresh water to the arid regions of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, which historically suffer from water scarcity due to its desert climate. The canal will provide an essential water source for the people and the agricultural fields of the region. It also plays an integral role in upholding the lake's ecosystem, thereby contributing towards the conservation of regional biodiversity, which is a matter of global environmental concern. However, this massive project has raised concerns as well, especially considering international water rights and the potential environmental impact from diverting a significant amount of water from the Irtysh River. The canal could alter the natural path of the Irtysh, affecting the entire ecological system of the river and the areas it flows through. These concerns should be addressed through bilateral discussions and agreements between the countries that share the Irtysh River course. It's important to note that all large-scale water diversion projects bring about certain challenges. These include the displacement of local species, the potential for conflict over water rights, and potential disruptions in the local ecosystem. These potential negative impacts need to be carefully balanced with the benefits that the project can bring to the region in terms of improved water availability and the ecological well-being of Ulyungur lake. In conclusion, the N635 project is a large-scale water diversion project aimed at addressing water scarcity issues in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by channeling water from the upper reaches of the Irtysh River to the Ulyungur lake. While the project brings potential benefits by providing crucial water resources to human and natural ecosystems in an arid region, it also poses a number of challenges, and ways should be found to mitigate any potential harm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Passage: Next, the Lions stayed at home for a Week 14 NFC North rematch with newly signed veteran quarterback Daunte Culpepper's former team, the Minnesota Vikings. In the first quarter, Detroit was on the board first as kicker Jason Hanson got a 25-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Lions increased their lead as Hanson got a 23-yard field goal. The Vikings would close out the half as kicker Ryan Longwell got a 35-yard field goal. During the first half, Moran Norris was ejected by referee Jerome Boger for throwing a punch at Minnesota's Napoleon Harris. In the third quarter, Minnesota took the lead as RB Chester Taylor got a 17-yard TD run. Detroit would respond with former Vikings QB Daunte Culpepper completing a 70-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. However, Minnesota got the lead again as QB Tarvaris Jackson completed an 11-yard TD pass to TE Visanthe Shiancoe. In the fourth quarter, the Lions tried to rally as Hanson made a 39-yard field goal.

First, let's look at the subtraction part: 3165 - 3129 Imagine you had 3165 candies and you gave away 3129 candies to your friends. How many candies would you have left? 3165 - 3129 = 36 So now you have 36 candies left. Now let's look at the equation: 36 = -6 * q In this part, we are trying to figure out how many times we have to share the 36 candies between your friends in a way that each friend will get the same amount of candies, but there's a little catch. The total candies we have are -6, not just 6. That means instead of giving candies, we are taking candies back from the friends in groups of 6. But how many times do we have to do this to balance the equation? To solve for 'q', we will divide 36 by -6: 36 / -6 = -6 So, q = -6. This means, to balance the equation, we have to take candies back from the friends 6 times in groups of six."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a text based on this summary: mob razes home of woman who allegedly ran kashmir prostitution ring Text:","completion":"In a shocking turn of events, an enraged mob took matters into their own hands by razing the home of a woman accused of running a prostitution ring in Kashmir. Sources say the local community, fed up with the alleged illegal activities, came together to demolish the property. Although it may be important to maintain law and order, it's worth examining the circumstances that led to this violent incident and its possible implications. Reports began to surface some time ago about an illicit prostitution operation being run in the region. The local authorities received numerous complaints, but the woman in question continued to operate her alleged business. This sparked anger and frustration among the local residents, who felt that the immoral activities had tarnished the image of their community. In response to what they perceived as a lack of action by police, the mob decided to take matters into their own hands. A large group of people gathered together, armed with various tools, and proceeded to raze the accused woman's home to the ground. The act was carried out as a form of vigilante justice, displaying the community's disgruntlement with both the prostitution ring and the perceived inefficiency of the local authorities. The situation raises some important questions about the rule of law in the area and the potential dangers of vigilantism. While it's understandable that locals would want to protect the reputation of their community, it's crucial to remember that everyone is entitled to a fair trial and due process. Resorting to violence and taking the law into one's own hands can potentially lead to further chaos and increased criminal activity, as people may feel justified in handling disputes with force rather than following the legal system. Additionally, the incident underscores the need for better communication between law enforcement and the public. By actively addressing community concerns and working to maintain transparency, the authorities can reaffirm their commitment to upholding the law and restore residents' faith in the justice system. Furthermore, this improved cooperation may prevent future incidents of vigilantism and promote a healthier, safer community. In conclusion, the mob's decision to raze the home of a woman accused of running a prostitution ring in Kashmir highlights the critical need for effective law enforcement and adherence to the legal process. By promoting cooperation between citizens and local authorities and emphasizing the importance of the rule of law, communities can work together to address criminal activities and prevent acts of vigilante justice that may further damage the social fabric."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Prepare the filling. The night before you bake the cake, pit the cherries. Separate enough cherries to cover the top of the cake. Then, place the cherries in a jar or bowl and soak them in the kirschwasser overnight. Cherries should decorate the outside rim of the cake. As the soaked cherries add an extra burst of flavor, it is essential to let them rest in the kirsch liqueur long enough for the cherries to absorb its distinct aroma and taste. This step is particularly important because once the cherries are placed on the cake, they not only enhance its visual appeal but also elevate its overall flavor profile. In addition, the kirschwasser's fruity taste beautifully compliments and balances the rich and deep flavors of the chocolate cake. Next, prepare the cake layers. Begin by preheating the oven to 350°F (175°C) and generously greasing and flouring three 9-inch (23-cm) round cake pans. In a large mixing bowl, combine the dry ingredients - flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt - and whisk them together. In a separate bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, and continue beating the mixture until well combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients. Make sure to mix well after each addition. Once the batter is smooth, divide it evenly among the prepared cake pans. Bake the cakes for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before removing them from the pans and transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. While the cakes are cooling, prepare the whipped cream frosting by combining heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl. Whip the ingredients using an electric mixer until the cream is stiff and holds its shape. To assemble the cake, place one cake layer on a serving plate and spread a generous layer of whipped cream on top. Drain the kirsch-soaked cherries, reserving the liquid, and spoon a portion of the cherries over the whipped cream. Place the second cake layer on top and repeat the process, finally placing the third layer and finishing with a layer of whipped cream. Frost the sides of the cake with the remaining whipped cream and use a piping bag with a star tip to create decorative borders around the top and bottom edges of the cake. For the finishing touch, arrange the reserved cherries around the outer rim of the cake and if desired, you can sprinkle chocolate shavings or curls over the top to add an extra touch of elegance and flavor. By following these detailed steps, you will have created a stunning and delectable black forest cake that is perfect for any celebration or special occasion. Enjoy the rich, harmonious blend of flavors and textures as you indulge in this classic dessert masterpiece."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Avoid lip balms that contain irritants or allergens, such as artificial fragrances, preservatives, or menthol, as these can cause further dryness or inflammation. In addition to using lip balm, it is important to address other factors that may contribute to dry chapped lips. Stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, as dehydration can cause your lips to lose moisture. Protect your lips from cold weather and wind by wearing a scarf or a mask when necessary. Avoid licking your lips, which can remove natural oils and create a cycle of dryness and chapping. Incorporate gentle exfoliation into your lip care routine to remove dead skin cells that can contribute to chapped lips; this can be done using a soft toothbrush or a homemade sugar scrub. Lastly, maintaining a healthy diet and practicing good oral hygiene can also contribute to preventing dry chapped lips. Consuming vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables helps provide your body with the necessary nutrients to maintain healthy skin, while brushing and flossing regularly minimize the risk of oral problems that may cause dry lips. By adopting these practices, along with using an appropriate lip balm, you can effectively prevent dry chapped lips and enjoy soft, healthy lips all year round."},{"prompt":"Given the question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: A bassoon for the following movie plot: Young, naive Canadian biologist Tyler (Charles Martin Smith) is assigned by the government to travel to the isolated Canadian arctic wilderness and study why the area's caribou population is declining, believed to be due to wolf-pack attacks; amongst his orders to study them he is also given a gun and required to kill one wolf and examine its stomach contents. Tyler receives a baptism of fire into bush life with a trip by bush plane piloted by Rosie (Brian Dennehy). After landing at the destination, Rosie leaves Tyler in the middle of a sub-zero frozen Arctic lake. Tyler is at a loss of what to do about his situation until he is rescued by a traveling Inuit named Ootek (Zachary Ittimangnaq), who transports him and his gear off the ice and builds a shelter for him. Alone, Tyler divides his days between research and survival, while nights are fraught with nightmares of wolf attacks upon him. He soon encounters two wolves â which he names George and Angeline, who have pups, and discovers they seem as curious of him as he is of them. He and the wolves begin social exchanges, even urine-marking their territories, producing trust and respect between them. Noticing that they haven't eaten any caribou and only mice, he begins a side experiment of eating only mice for protein sustenance. Another Inuit named Mike (Samson Jorah) encounters Tyler, sent by Ootek for companionship. Mike knows English and Inuit, translating between Ootek and Tyler. Ootek, the elder, is content and curious about Tyler, while the younger Mike seems not only more reserved but unhappy with the Inuit way of life, confessing to Tyler his social apprehensions, this is mainly due to the fact that Mike is missing nearly all his teeth as well as telling Tyler about the time he met a girl and how she was comfortable with him until he smiled.

If malignant cells divide more often than normal cells,, then _cells divide more often than normal cells? Answer choices: - Nerve - retina - Most plants - heat or cold - Endothelial - Stem - Malignant - layers of fat A:","completion":"Malignant cells divide more often than normal cells. Out of the answer choices provided, it is important to analyze each option to determine which type of cells divide more often than normal cells: 1. Nerve cells: Nerve cells, or neurons, are specialized cells that transmit nerve impulses. They have limited regenerative capacity and do not undergo cell division frequently after maturity. Hence, nerve cells do not divide more often than normal cells. 2. Retina cells: Retina cells, specifically photoreceptors and other neurons in the retina, also have limited regenerative capacity and do not divide more often than normal cells. 3. Most plants: Plant cells contain specialized structures called meristematic tissue, which are responsible for plant growth. Since this growth is regulated in most plants, they do not typically exhibit uncontrolled division like malignant cells. Therefore, most plant cells do not divide more often than normal cells. 4. Heat or cold: Heat or cold are not cells but rather environmental conditions that could potentially impact cell division. Thus, this option is invalid and irrelevant for this discussion. 5. Endothelial cells: Endothelial cells form the inner lining of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. They play a crucial role in maintaining vascular function and homeostasis. Although they have some capacity to regenerate or proliferate when needed, endothelial cells do not divide more often than normal cells under typical conditions. 6. Stem cells: Stem cells are unique cells capable of both self-renewal (division without differentiation) and differentiation into specialized cell types. They serve as a repair system for the body by replenishing damaged cells when required. While they have a higher division frequency compared to some other cell types, under normal conditions, healthy stem cells do not divide more often than normal cells to the extent of malignant cells. 7. Malignant cells: Malignant cells are cancerous cells characterized by uncontrolled growth and division, often invading surrounding tissues and even spreading to other parts of the body. These cells divide more often than normal cells, which is the primary issue associated with malignancy. 8. Layers of fat: Layers of fat consist mainly of adipose tissue, which contains adipocytes or fat cells. These cells do not typically divide more often than normal cells, as they primarily function to store energy and provide insulation. Based on this analysis, the correct answer to the initial question is: Malignant cells divide more often than normal cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Acknowledging the fact that Lesotho is an enclave state surrounded by SA , the ability of people to move freely depends on whether they are allowed to enter SA or not . What is the general argument implied by these sentences?","completion":"The general argument implied by these sentences is that the annexation of Lesotho by South Africa could potentially be beneficial for both countries, particularly for Lesotho, given its increasing dependency on South Africa for resources and trade. A key point emphasized is the economic relationship between the two nations. Lesotho has become increasingly dependent on imports from South Africa, with 70% of its imported goods coming from its neighboring country. This dependency has been on the rise since 1980, when Lesotho produced a larger portion of its consumed cereals. Annexation could potentially boost trade between the two countries by eliminating existing borders, leading to increased prosperity for both. The importance of the border between Lesotho and South Africa is also highlighted, with 40% of border crossings into South Africa coming from Lesotho. For the Basotho people, the ability to move freely is crucial, as it is largely dependent on the cooperation of the South African government. This movement is currently hindered by corruption at border posts, as well as long queues and slow service that 63% of border crossers experience. In summary, the general argument is that annexation by South Africa would help mitigate some of the issues Lesotho faces as an enclave state, improving its economic situation and facilitating the free movement of its people. In turn, this could promote a closer relationship between the two countries while benefiting both economically. However, it's essential to consider the sovereignty and the will of the Basotho people while contemplating any such measure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Let's analyze both the premise and hypothesis. Premise: The problem is that the ADR phenomenon has created a situation where U.S. investors are pouring billions of dollars into companies whose standards of financial disclosure and corporate governance are dramatically different from our own and which are, in some cases, nonexistent. The premise states that the ADR (American Depositary Receipt) phenomenon has caused U.S. investors to invest heavily in companies with financial disclosure and corporate governance standards that are different from that of the United States, and in some cases, nonexistent. This implies that U.S. investors are investing in such companies, potentially putting their investments at risk due to the lack of transparency and poor governance. Hypothesis: The United States investors sink money only into companies with strict policies on providing information on their finances. The hypothesis assumes that U.S. investors only invest in companies that maintain high standards for financial disclosure. This implies that these investors would prioritize the transparency and governance of the companies they invest in. Now, let's compare the premise and hypothesis to determine if the premise being true makes the hypothesis true as well. The premise indicates that U.S. investors are investing in companies with varying standards of financial disclosure and corporate governance due to the ADR phenomenon, including those with nonexistent standards. This directly contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that U.S. investors only invest in companies with strict policies on financial information disclosure. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The truth of the premise contradicts the hypothesis, making the hypothesis false in the context provided. The correct option is III: No."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help.

North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan said in a statement released by the North’s central news agency (KCNA) that his country remains open to resolving problems with the United States “whenever and however,” and offered praise for President Trump’s diplomatic engagement efforts. “We had held in high regards President Trump’s efforts, unprecedented by any other president, to create a historic North Korea-U.S. summit,” said the vice foreign minister in a statement released Friday by KCNA. The conciliatory tone that came from Vice Foreign Minister Kim stands in sharp contrast to earlier criticisms, insults and threats made by another North Korean official that prompted Trump to cancel the June summit in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. On Thursday North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui called U.S. Vice President Mike Pence a “political dummy” and threatened a “nuclear-to-nuclear showdown” with the U.S. over comments made by Pence calling for North Korea to follow the Libya denuclearization model. The Libya model refers to the rapid and complete dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program in 2003 and 2004, before the easing of any sanctions. But North Korea is acutely aware that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed by his own people a few years later, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the United States. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until its undefined security demands are met. Trump blamed the “tremendous anger and open hostility” from Pyongyang for forcing the cancelation of the summit, but many analysts say the issue was more about substance over tone and the unbridgeable gap between the two denuclearization positions.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Constantly forcing yourself to mingle, chit-chat and cold-call will take its toll. Doing things that you hate on a regular basis is a surefire recipe for burnout. Don’t try to be someone you're not. Instead, try to develop a business model that fits the real you and learn to be comfortable with who you truly are. Most importantly, believe that you're as capable as any other person at succeeding in business. Remember, there's nothing \\"wrong\\" with you. It's not bad to prefer one-on-one company over a party. It's not a character flaw to be a great listener. It's not a sin to be a deep thinker. It's not wrong to think before you speak. Keep in mind that, as an introvert, you have a series of character traits that are positive and can help you in business. Speak self-affirmations out loud. If you're feeling a bit insecure because you're an introvert, speak out some self-affirmations that will reinforce your belief in yourself. Introverts have many positive qualities. Use those qualities to your advantage in business. For example, introverts might not be very outspoken, but they're often very good listeners. You'll find that listening can carry you a long way in your business with peers, employees, and partners. Also, introverts tend to be creative because they're inside their own head so much. That creativity can benefit you in business, especially when it comes to advertising. Your ideal office space is a private office where you can retreat, shut the door, and think about how to solve business problems. You'll work best in a quiet, away-from-the-crowd location. Avoid creating an \\"open office\\" environment where you'll be part of the crowd. That kind of workplace is suited well for extroverts, but not for an introvert like you. Summary:","completion":"Forcing yourself to engage in social activities you dislike can lead to burnout. Embrace your introverted nature and develop a business model that suits you. Believe in your capabilities and remember that introverts possess positive qualities such as being good listeners and being creative. Use self-affirmations to boost your confidence and capitalize on your introverted strengths in business.

(June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) When North Carolina secedes from the Union on May 20, 1861, the young men of a rural, provincial, North Carolina backwater known only as Cold Mountain hurry to enlist in the Confederate military. Among them is W.P. Inman (Jude Law), a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada (Nicole Kidman), a minister's daughter, and finds their whirlwind courtship interrupted by the American Civil War. Three years later, Inman finds himself in the trenches of Petersburg, Virginia, during the Battle of the Crater. Union soldiers tunneling beneath Confederate fortifications detonate over 300 kegs of gunpowder, in a futile attempt to undermine the position prior to their assault. As the ill-fated attack begins, Oakley (Lucas Black) an old acquaintance of Inman's from Cold Mountain, is impaled on a bayonet and mortally wounded. Inman rescues him from the fighting and takes him to a field hospital. Later that day Oakley dies in the hospital, with Inman and Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson) beside him. The next night, Inman, along with his Cherokee friend Swimmer (Jay Tavare), are sent to flush out surviving Union troops trapped behind their lines. During the raid, a burst of friendly fire kills Swimmer and seriously injures Inman. As Inman lies in the hospital near death, he has a letter from Ada read to him in which she pleads with him to stop fighting, stop marching, and come back to her. Inman recovers, andâwith the war drawing ever closer to an inevitable Confederate defeatâdecides to go home to Cold Mountain. On his journey he meets the corrupt preacher Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover. Inman stops Veasey, and leaves him tied up to face the town's justice. Exiled from his parish, Veasey later rejoins Inman on his journey. They help a young man named...

A memorial stone to First Fleet commander Admiral Arthur Phillip was unveiled at Westminster Abbey in central London on Thursday. The Duke of Edinburgh laid a wreath at the stone during an hour-long dedication service on Wednesday that was also attended by NSW Governor Dame Marie Bashir. Phillip, the first governor of NSW, is the latest addition to the long list of 3,300 notable people buried or memorialised in the abbey. This year marks 200 years since Phillip died in August 1814 in England. A memorial stone to First Fleet commander Admiral Arthur Phillip was unveiled at Westminster Abbey in central London on Thursday. Prince Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh attended the service of dedication to Admiral Philip and laid a wreath at the memorial stone. During Wednesday's service Dame Marie praised the admiral as being 'enlightened, far-sighted and indeed humane'. 'Determined to ensure the fair treatment of the Aboriginal people he actively fostered harmonious relations with them,' she said. The memorial - carved from Sydney sandstone - is set in the floor of the Nave near memorials to David Livingstone, Thomas Cochrane and Isaac Newtown. It's also nearby to the grave of the unknown warrior. It reads: 'Admiral Arthur Phillip. Royal Navy 1738-1814. First Governor of NSW & founder of modern Australia'. There's a small outline of a kangaroo too. The memorial stone reads: 'Admiral Arthur Phillip. Royal Navy 1738-1814. First Governor of NSW & founder of modern Australia'. There is also a small outline of a kangaroo. Carved from Sydney sandstone, the memorial is set in the floor of the Nave near a memorial to Isaac Newtown. NSW Governor Marie Bashir attended the service and said the admiral ensured the fair treatment of the Aboriginal people and actively fostered harmonious relations with them. Admiral Arthur Philip was born on October 11, 1738 and died on August 31, 1814. On May 13, 1787, the First Fleet of 11 ships set sail from Portsmouth, England for NSW. Mr Phillip captained HMS Sirius in the fleet. Over 252 days, the First Fleet brought about 1,500 men, women and children half way around the world from England to Australia. The fleet arrived first in Botany Bay on 18 January, 1788 and later in Sydney Cove (in Port Jackson), as named by Mr Phillip, on January 26. Sydney Cove was preferred because of its access to fresh water for the colony. Mr Phillip was the first Governor of NSW and founder of the settlement, which became Sydney. The Dean of Westminster, Dr John Hall, described the navy man as a 'modest, yet world-class seaman, linguist and patriot, whose selfless service laid the secure foundations on which was developed the Commonwealth of Australia'. Phillip was in charge of the 11 ships of the First Fleet which carried some 1,450 individuals, half of which were convicts. He was meant to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay but due to his rural background realised the soils and adjacent rivers were not suitable to sustaining agriculture. So in 1788 he sailed on to Port Jackson instead which later became Sydney Harbour. The memorial stone came about following years of lobbying by the Britain-Australia Society Education Trust whose patron is the Duke of Edinburgh. The society said in a statement: 'Admiral Phillip is hardly known in the UK, although in Australia, Phillip Bay in NSW and Port Phillip Bay in Victoria are named after him.' Admiral Phillip was in charge of the 11 ships of the First Fleet. This year marks 200 years since the admiral died in August 1814 in England.

(CNN) -- The Supreme Court of the United States has long been a unique political and legal institution. Our justices are the only judges in the world who sit on a nation's highest court for life. Their power to strike down the political decisions of the president, the Congress and the states (the power of judicial review) is nowhere spelled out in our Constitution. Yet, since the beginning, both the court and the American people have assumed that power to exist. The justices don't act like normal judges bound by law (because they're not), but they are not quite lawmakers, either. Having neither the \\"purse nor the sword,\\" the justices rely solely on the elected branches of government for the enforcement of their decisions.

Continuing the news story: Not surprisingly, the poll revealed great support for television cameras in the Supreme Court, a move the justices have rejected for way too long. The overwhelming public sentiment, as expressed in the poll, is that greater transparency and openness can benefit the functioning of such a vital institution within the American legal and political system. The use of television cameras to broadcast court proceedings is seen as an opportunity to increase understanding of the workings of the court, its decisions, and the impact on the lives of ordinary citizens, who may not always be familiar with the nuances of the law. Opponents of this idea argue that introducing television cameras into the Supreme Court could lead to a media circus, with the potential to disrupt court proceedings and place undue attention on individual justices, rather than on the legal issues at hand. They also express concerns that the public's superficial understanding of complex legal arguments may lead to attempts to sway the court's decisions through populist pushes and public pressure. However, proponents of allowing television cameras in the Supreme Court maintain that the benefits outweigh the negative aspects. The adoption of such a policy would not only lead to increased visibility of the court's work, fostering a better-informed citizenry, but also provide a form of democratic accountability, ensuring that the actions of justices stay focused on the task at hand and the long-term implications of their decisions. The debate over allowing television cameras in the Supreme Court is not new and has been ongoing for some time. However, the recent poll results and the increasing clamor for transparency in the nation's highest legal institution are clear indications that the American public believes it is time for a change. The judiciary, like any other branch of government, can benefit from public scrutiny. The integration of modern technology like television cameras into the Supreme Court can be seen as a logical evolution of the legal process in the digital age. Perhaps the time has come for the justices to reassess their stance on this issue, and to consider the significance of greater openness in the process of interpreting and applying the Constitution for the betterment of the nation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We want to find out what number \\"z\\" is. The problem says: 372 times z, minus 266, equals 106. So, we can write it like this: 372 * z - 266 = 106 Now, we want to get \\"z\\" all by itself. First, let's add 266 to both sides of the equation. This will help us get rid of the \\"-266\\" on the left side. So, 372 * z - 266 + 266 = 106 + 266 This simplifies to: 372 * z = 372 Now, we want to find out what number \\"z\\" is. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 372. This will help us get \\"z\\" all by itself on the left side. So, (372 * z) / 372 = 372 / 372 This simplifies to: z = 1 So, our answer is z = 1. Hooray!

Pick from: * unacceptable; * acceptable;","completion":"The given sentence: \\"Wilt is taller than it is generally believed that Bill is,\\" might raise questions about its syntactical and semantical acceptability, as it can be seen as confusing and unusual. However, upon close examination and considering each aspect in detail, we can break down the sentence structure and its meaning, addressing each factor separately. Syntactically, the sentence follows acceptable English sentence structure. It could be rewritten as: \\"Wilt is taller than people generally believe Bill is,\\" which has clearer syntactical structure. The original sentence is an example of an embedded clause, with \\"it is generally believed that Bill is,\\" functioning as a subject. Thus, \\"Wilt is taller than X,\\" where X represents the embedded clause. It is important to note that although the sentence is structured in a more complex manner, it still follows acceptable syntax. Semantically, the sentence conveys a clear meaning, asserting that Wilt's height is greater than the height that people generally believe Bill to have. In essence, it is a comparison of Wilt's actual height to Bill's perceived height. Taking both syntactical and semantical aspects of the sentence into consideration, we can conclude that the sentence is acceptable. Nonetheless, it may be less ideal for academic or formal writing due to its complex structure and potential for confusion, as clearer and simpler alternatives exist."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore.

Article:","completion":"Title: Jupiter's Gravity and its Influence on Earth's Climate and Habitability of Exoplanets Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has long held a profound fascination for astronomers and scientists alike. Its intense gravitational pull has often been backed by computer simulations to understand how this cosmic giant impacts the orbits and climates of other celestial bodies. A recent study explored Jupiter's gravitational influence on Earth's climate throughout the course of its early history, enabling scientists to refine their search for habitable planets outside the solar system. Step 1: Exploring Jupiter's gravitational pull on other planets The starting point of this research revolved around Jupiter's gravitational force and how it could potentially affect the position and tilt of other planets in the solar system. This investigation was conducted using in-depth computer simulations, which took into account the distance and position of each planet in relation to both Jupiter and the Sun. Step 2: Analyzing the impact of Jupiter's orbit on Earth's tilt and orbit With a particular focus on Earth, the experts delved into the specific effects that Jupiter's orbit might have on our planet's tilt and orbit. These parameters are crucial as they play a major role in determining Earth's climate. The simulations revealed that Jupiter's orbit surprisingly had no significant impact on the Earth's tilt and orbit. Step 3: Evaluating the influence of Jupiter's gravity on Earth's early climate While the effect of Jupiter's gravity on Earth's tilt and orbit may have been negligible, its influence on Earth's early climate remained unclear. As climate conditions are an essential factor in determining the habitability of planets, this aspect of the study bears great importance in understanding how Jupiter's gravity might have shaped Earth over time. Step 4: Applying findings to the search for habitable exoplanets The knowledge gained from this analysis not only aids in understanding the role Jupiter played in Earth's developmental stages but also informs astronomers' ongoing quest to discover habitable planets outside our solar system. By utilizing these findings, researchers can now narrow down their search criteria and better identify exoplanets with the potential to support life. In conclusion, Jupiter's gravity may not have a significant impact on the tilt and orbit of other planets, including Earth, but its influence on their climatic conditions remains uncertain. The results of this study, however, offer valuable insights for astronomers seeking habitable exoplanets in the vastness of space. The research contributes to the understanding of celestial mechanics and raises further curiosity about the unique and wondrous world of outer space."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: After the meeting, who was emotional?

Movie title: The Remains of the Day Context: In 1950s England, Mr Stevens (Anthony Hopkins), the butler of Darlington Hall, receives a letter from Miss Kenton (Emma Thompson), who worked with him as housekeeper during the years prior to the Second World War. Twenty years later, Lord Darlington (James Fox) has died and his stately country manor has been sold to a retired American Congressman, Mr. Lewis (Christopher Reeve). Kenton reveals that her marriage has failed and that she is nostalgic for the days when she worked at the house. Stevens (now one of the few remaining servants from the Darlington era) goes to visit Miss Kenton, ostensibly to persuade her to return to service.The film flashes back to Kenton's arrival as housekeeper. At the time, Darlington Hall was frequented by many politicians of the interwar period, men who decided important affairs of state while there. Stevens, loyal and perfectionistic, calm and efficient, had to manage the household so that the servants seemed almost invisible, and he took great pride in his skills and his profession. He clashed with Miss Kenton, his equal in the household hierarchy, but displayed only understated irritation with her and others. Indeed, his utter focus and emotional repression were most fully displayed when his own father, also an employee, was dying; Stevens continued his duties without pause.Miss Kenton was equally efficient and strong-willed but warmer and less repressed. Relations between the two eventually warmed and Kenton even teased Stevens. It becomes clear that she had fallen in love with him, and perhaps he with her, though his feelings are left ambiguous. She tried to break through the wall, but Stevens' coldness was too formidable. Finally, she struck up a relationship with another man and married him, leaving the house just before the outbreak of World War II. Before her departure, she insulted Stevens, clearly out of distress that he had never expressed any emotional interest in her, but he still refused to be moved.

It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change.

First, I read through the context provided by the user: \\"Jordan and Tracy were going to the store and Jordan asked Casey to get the keys.\\" This suggests that Jordan's immediate next step is likely dependent on whether Casey is successful in getting the keys. 2. Then I break down the given question: \\"What will Jordan want to do next?\\" This is asking for a prediction of Jordan's next course of action based on the context given. 3. Now, I analyze each answer choice in relation to the context and the question: A: 'think about the keys': This does not seem like a logical next action for Jordan as Jordan has already asked Casey to get the keys. Therefore, Jordan wouldn't need to think about the keys again unless Casey was unsuccessful. B: 'go to the store': This does seem like a logical next action for Jordan. In the context provided, Jordan and Tracy were intending to go to the store. Jordan asking Casey to get the keys implies that the keys are likely for a vehicle that they intend to use to go to the store. C: 'buy things': While this is ultimately likely to be an action that Jordan takes, it is not the immediate next step. Before Jordan can buy things, they have to go to the store first. 4. Based on my analysis, I conclude that option B: 'go to the store' best answers the question according to the context provided, as it's the most logical and immediate next action for Jordan after getting the keys.

The incident raised safety concerns of a different sort. A routine cheerleading stunt went awry as a cheerleader was thrown into the air then, shockingly, 'dropped by her teammates' as she plummeted towards the ground. Witnesses of the terrifying incident said she landed on her neck, the impact leaving her immobile on the field for several anxiety-ridden minutes. The cheerleader was promptly attended to by the medical staff present at the stadium. She was carefully stretchered off the field and immediately transferred to a nearby hospital for an onslaught of tests. Though the severity of her injury was uncertain at the time, the incident was disturbing enough to cast a temporary pall over the game. Not surprisingly, concerned football fans took to social media to voice their apprehensions. Match-goers and the broader online community alike turned to Twitter to express shock, empathy, and concern for the unidentified cheerleader. Amongst the outpouring of reactions was that of Madison Kirk, who grimly noted the gravity of the situation, saying, 'It is pretty serious.' Numerous individuals, deeply shaken by the event, offered their prayers and well-wishes for her speedy recovery, taking to their social media accounts to express their concern and solidarity. Fans were somewhat relieved later on, courtesy of an official announcement from a Ravens spokesperson. The official assured worried followers that the cheerleader's tests were precautionary, and thankfully, initial results came back clear. The troubling incident once again brought the safety protocols of such stunting practices under scrutiny. However, for the moment, the focus remains on the cheerleader's recovery and well-being.

'Election confessions' reveals how depressed Americans are about this weird 2016 race How are you feeling about the election? That's not a question people hear all that often. Even less common is the chance to answer honestly in public.

To submit, people can send a text, a photo of text or drop a voicemail at 424-353-2016.

The first solution to any problem is that you realize the problem. Most of the time, difficult people do not realize they are difficult. They think what they do is just normal. But do you know how to cope with difficult people? The best way is not to care what they said. If this does not help, think about the following: *Difficult people are easy to be very angry, and you just happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. *Difficult people do not even hear the words you say, but are only guessing the meaning of your words according to their own thought.

Here are possible answers to this question: - box of crackers - face - rug - table - floor I believe the correct choice is \\"table\\", here's why:","completion":"The correct choice indeed is \\"table,\\" and there are several reasons that support this answer. First, let's examine each of the options and understand the context in which they might be applicable. 1. Box of crackers: While it is conceivable that crumbs might accumulate on a box of crackers, it is not the primary role of a busboy to attend to such matters. Busboys are typically responsible for clearing and cleaning tables, not handling or arranging food items. 2. Face: It seems highly unlikely and inappropriate for a busboy to wipe crumbs off a person's face, as this would be seen as a violation of personal space. Additionally, it would be unexpected for a busboy to perform such an intimate gesture. 3. Rug: If the restaurant has a rug or a carpeted area, it might accumulate some crumbs over time. However, a busboy would not be responsible for such tasks in a restaurant setting. They are primarily responsible for clearing and preparing tables. This duty might fall upon the cleaning staff or possibly the servers in some scenarios. 4. Table: The primary role of a busboy in a restaurant is to clear and clean tables once guests have completed their meals. Following the clearing of used dishes, it would be logical for the busboy to wipe any remaining crumbs off the table in preparation for the next customers or the next course. 5. Floor: Again, the busboy’s main responsibility is related to tables, not floors. While crumbs might undoubtedly fall to the floor during a meal, this is a task that would typically be taken care of by the cleaning staff members, not busboys. Based on the analysis of each option, the most fitting choice in this scenario is \\"table\\". The busboy's primary responsibility is to ensure that the dining table is cleared of any dishes, glassware, utensils, and crumbs, ensuring a clean and pleasant environment for the next customers or the next course of the meal. It is both logical and aligned with general restaurant operational protocols for the busboy to wipe all the crumbs off the table after dinner was finished and the dishes were cleared."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Another tale of woe from me… When I met my ex, I was in foster care. I was a very confused 17 year old, and she took an interest in me, and we would talk about all my problems with my own family, and everything that was going wrong with me. I even ‘came out’ to her at one point. We spent a lot of time together and gradually, I thought I might not be gay after all, as I had feelings of love for her. Eventually, we started dating and I tried to suppress my gay feelings. Eventually, I proposed. We were engaged for just over a year and I got married at the age of 19. I have to admit, when the wedding plans got firmed up and much closer to the date, I started to feel that I was in fact still gay but so much money had already been spent, and plans made that I was too afraid to pull out. Don’t get me wrong, I still love my ex wife a heck of a lot, but as my very best friend. I hate to use the phrase, but with everything that has gone on with me the last few years, she has been ‘my rock’. We separated after about 8 years, when our daughter was 7 years old, and I told her why. I just couldn’t go on living the lie. I hate myself for doing it to her. Selfishly, I wouldn’t change things though, as I have my daughter and I love her, and I love being a parent.

What is the answer to this question? where did the oregon trail start and stop?","completion":"The Oregon Trail was a significant 19th-century route for pioneers and settlers in the United States. Running approximately 2,170 miles (3,490 kilometers), the trail spanned from the Missouri River in the east to Oregon's Willamette Valley in the west. The purpose of the trail was to facilitate the westward expansion of the United States by connecting its eastern frontier with the fertile lands in the west. The starting point of the Oregon Trail was in Independence, Missouri. Independence was a key location for several reasons. First, it was situated at the edge of the American frontier at the time, making it a natural launching point for westward exploration. Second, it was located on the Missouri River, allowing supplies and settlers to be transported upstream from St. Louis. Finally, it was a bustling center of commerce and trade, offering ample opportunities for pioneers to purchase or trade for the supplies and livestock they would need for their journey. As the pioneers set out on the Oregon Trail from Independence, they traversed the present-day states of Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon. Their journey took them across rivers, prairies, mountains, and deserts. It was a challenging route marked by unpredictable weather, treacherous terrain, and hostile Native American tribes. The Oregon Trail's endpoint was in the Willamette Valley in Oregon, particularly around Oregon City, which is now a part of the Portland metropolitan area. This region was known for its fertile land, mild climate, and abundant natural resources. The promise of free land and the potential for prosperity in the Pacific Northwest motivated thousands to undertake the arduous journey along the Oregon Trail. During its peak in the 1840s to the 1860s, as many as 400,000 pioneers traversed the Oregon Trail in search of a better life, new opportunities, and the prospect of acquiring land under the Preemption Act and the Homestead Act. The completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 eventually led to the decline of the Oregon Trail, as settlers could now travel west more quickly and easily by rail. Today, many historical sites, monuments, and museums commemorate the events and the journey along the Oregon Trail, making it an important and enduring symbol of American expansion and pioneer spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Based on the information provided in both sentences, it is difficult to determine the definitive truth value of the second sentence in relation to the first. However, we can analyze the information provided and infer possible meanings and scenarios. In Sentence 1, it appears that the speaker and their companion(s) are searching for someone's office (presumably in a building). However, the speech is quite disjointed, suggesting that they might be unsure, confused, or hesitant about their search. They mention considering the location and distance of the office in relation to the person they're seeking, but they never explicitly state that they found or even continued looking for the office. It's possible that their uncertainty or lack of information may have led them to abandon their search at some point. Alternatively, it could also mean they are in the process of searching for the office and haven't found it yet. Sentence 2, on the other hand, clearly states that the speaker and their companion(s) did not bother to look for the office. This seems to be in direct contradiction to the first sentence, but the lack of specificity and clarity in the first sentence leaves room for uncertainty. There are a few possible interpretations: 1. If the search described in Sentence 1 did not eventuate in actually finding the office or was never fully initiated because of the uncertainty, one could argue that the second sentence is true, because they did not thoroughly look for the office. 2. If the search described in Sentence 1 was ultimately successful or is currently ongoing, then the second sentence would be considered false, as they are indeed looking for the office. 3. A third possibility could be that the speaker changed their mind between the first and second sentences – for example, after initially searching for the office, they may have decided against pursuing it further, thus rendering both sentences true based on the information available at the time each sentence was spoken. In conclusion, without further context or clarification, we cannot definitively determine the truth value of the second sentence in relation to the first. The disjointed nature of the first sentence makes it difficult to ascertain whether a search was actually carried out or ongoing, leading to ambiguity when trying to compare the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. - Extreme metal is a loosely defined umbrella term for a number of related heavy metal music subgenres that have developed since the early 1980s. It has been defined as a \\"cluster of metal subgenres characterized by sonic, verbal and visual transgression\\". The term usually refers to a more abrasive, harsher, underground, non-commercialized style or sound associated with the speed metal, thrash metal, death metal, black metal and doom metal genres. With the exception of doom metal, all of these genres are characterized by fast tempos, attesting to their roots in hardcore punk, which has also fused with extreme metal in the forms of crossover thrash, crust punk, grindcore, sludge metal and metalcore. Though many extreme sub-styles are not very well known to mainstream music fans, extreme metal has influenced an array of musical performers inside and outside of heavy metal. - Hellbastard are a crust punk band, formed in 1984/5 in the United Kingdom. Members \\"Scruff Lewty\\" \\"Phil Laidlaw\\" and \\"Scotty\\" formed Hellbastard, which was to be a combination of Crass-like politics and the music of Slayer. In 1990, after several EPs and full-lengths, the group appeared on the Combat-Earache compilation album, \\"Grindcrusher\\", with the song \\"Justly Executed\\", from the Earache Records \\"Natural Order\\" LP. - Dystopia is the third and final LP by sludge metal / crust punk band Dystopia . It was recorded in 2004 - 2005 and was released in early 2008 . - Southern rock is a subgenre of rock music and a genre of Americana. It developed in the Southern United States from rock and roll, country music, and blues, and is focused generally on electric guitar and vocals. Although the origin of the term Southern rock is unknown, \\"many people feel that these important contributors to the development of rock and roll have been minimized in rock's history.\\" - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics. - Melvins are an American rock band that formed in 1983 in Montesano, Washington. They have mostly performed as a trio, as well as a quartet with two drummers in recent years. Since 1984, vocalist and guitarist Buzz Osborne and drummer Dale Crover have been constant members. The band was named after a supervisor at a Thriftway in Montesano, Washington, where Osborne also worked as a clerk. \\"Melvin\\" was despised by other employees, and the band's members felt it to be an appropriately ridiculous name. Their early work was key to the development of both grunge and sludge metal. - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Fish species are expected to shrink in size by up to 24% because of global warming, say scientists. The scientists argue that failure to control greenhouse gas emissions will have a greater effect on marine ecosystems than previously thought. Previous research has suggested that changing ocean temperatures would affect both the distribution and the reproductive abilities of many species of fish. This new work suggests that fish size would also be heavily affected. The researchers built a model to see how fish would react to lower levels of oxygen in the water. As ocean temperatures increase, so do the body temperatures of fish. But, according to lead author, Dr William Cheung, from the University of British Columbia, the lower level of oxygen in the water is key. Warmer waters could decrease ocean oxygen levels and greatly reduce fish body weight. On the other hand, rising temperatures directly increase the metabolic rate of the fish's body function. This leads to an increase in oxygen demand for normal body activities. So the fish will run out of oxygen for growth at a smaller body size. The research team also used its model to predict fish movements as a result of warming waters. The group believes that most fish populations will move towards the Earth's poles at a rate of up to 35km per decade. \\"So in, say, the North Sea,\\" says Dr Cheung,\\" one would expect to see more smaller-body fish from tropical waters in the future.\\" Taking these factors into consideration, the research team concludes that fish body size will shrink between 14% and 24%, with the largest decreases in the Indian and Atlantic oceans. When compared with actual observations of fish sizes, the model seems to _ what's actually happening in the seas. The researchers looked at two case studies involving North Atlantic cod and haddock. They found that recorded data on these fish showed greater decreases in body size than the models had predicted. Dr Alan Baudron, from the University of Aberdeen, UK, believes smaller-sized fish could seriously...

They also want the existing restriction of five hits in the last furlong, or after the last jump, abolished. However, the riders are not opposed to the total maximum number of strokes in a race remaining at eight on the Flat or seven over jumps. The dispute over tougher regulations nearly led to a strike on Monday. But that threat receded when the Professional Jockeys Association (PJA) the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) on 17 October to possibly 'amend' some of the newly implemented whip regulations. A main difference between the PJA's proposal and the new rules, which were introduced on 10 October, is that there would be no forfeit of riding fee or prize money. On Saturday, Belgian jockey Christophe Soumillon was stripped of his £50,000 winnings from Champions Day at Ascot. PJA chief executive Kevin Darley said: \\"There is now a process of proper consultation and discussion involving jockeys which should have happened before the original announcement by the BHA last month. \\"Had we been properly consulted over some of the important details that relate directly to jockeys prior to that announcement we feel that we would not be in the position we are today.

Initially, jockeys Frankie Dettori and AP McCoy believed that the new rules were a positive step forward. However, in a joint statement, the two jockeys have now said: \\"In hindsight we would like to have given more thought and consideration to the new rules before commenting. \\"We didn't give them properly informed approval and we really do wish the BHA would stop saying that we did.\\" Meanwhile, former champion Flat jockey Ryan Moore has called for a complete return to the old rules. \\"You can't put a number on what is abuse, you could hit a horse once and it could be abuse and you could hit a horse 20 times and it wouldn't be,\\" he told Racing UK.

Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. Tony and Greg are brothers.

Go through IVF (Intro Vitro Fertilization.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Twinning Your Bundle of Joy: Exploring Medical Options to Increase Your Chances of Twins Introduction The dream of having a baby can be a cherished aspiration for many. For some, the prospect of being blessed with twins can be an immense source of joy and excitement. The concept of twins, both identical and fraternal, has been gaining more curiosity in recent years. However, conceiving twins does not solely depend on hereditary factors, and there may be medically-assisted routes available to increase chances of having a twin pregnancy. This article will explore various methods that doctors may employ to help couples in their quest for a duo bundle of joy, including the use of the oral medication Clomid and delving into the intricacies of In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). The Role of Medical Assistance in Conceiving Twins While family genetics undoubtedly play a significant role in the occurrence of twins, taking charge of one's fertility and exploring medically-assisted options can optimize the likelihood of twin conception. These methods often involve the assistance of a fertility specialist or gynecologist who can guide couples through the available options and assist in formulating a suitable and personalized plan for a hopeful twin pregnancy. Oral Medication \\"Clomid\\" In the realm of fertility and conception, the drug Clomid (Clomiphene Citrate) has gained a reputation as an effective treatment option to induce ovulation, primarily in women struggling with infertility. Clomid is an ovary-stimulating drug whose primary purpose is to encourage egg production in the ovaries. Consequently, the increased ovulation rate can enhance the possibility of having twins. Clomid stimulates the production of multiple eggs by inhibiting estrogen-receptor activity in the hypothalamus. This prompts the release of the pituitary gland hormone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), which then stimulates the growth of ovarian follicles and triggers the release of ripe eggs. The use of Clomid for increased twin prospects has garnered promising results, with research indicating a 5% to 8% twin pregnancy rate among women undergoing Clomid treatment. It's important to note that the likelihood of having twins upon taking Clomid relies on several factors, including age, ethnicity, and other individual aspects. In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) If you are considering IVF, it's essential to know there is a considerable monetary and emotional investment required for the procedure. IVF is an intricate process involving the fertilization of eggs outside the woman's body, creating embryos that are subsequently implanted into her uterus. This process increases the odds of conception, particularly among women struggling with infertility issues. A crucial aspect of IVF that increases the likelihood of twin conception is the practice of implanting multiple embryos into the womb. This method is employed to enhance the chances of successful implantation. Multiple embryo transfers do come with inherent risks, including the possible outcome of higher-order multiple pregnancies, such as triplets or quadruplets. It's worth noting that the rate of twin pregnancies resulting from IVF is significantly higher than that of natural conception. According to studies, the twin rate for women who undergo IVF ranges from 20% to 40%, depending on the number of embryos transferred and other individual factors. Final Thoughts Navigating the journey of conception and fertility can be an overwhelming experience with numerous paths available in the quest for a twin pregnancy. Enlisting the help and expertise of a doctor to guide you through options such as Clomid therapy or undergoing IVF can increase the chances of bringing home not one, but two bundles of joy. It's crucial to weigh the potential risks and benefits before embarking on any fertility treatment to ensure the healthiest and happiest outcome for both mother and babies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With escalating conflicts and economic despair in many parts of the world, millions of people have been forced to leave their homes in search of safety and better opportunities. One such group of refugees, hailing from Senegal, has recently decided to return to their homeland after spending years in Italy. This article seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of this decision, exploring the motives and factors influencing their return, as well as the challenges and prospects they may encounter upon arriving back at home. 1. The Background: Senegalese Migration to Europe Over the past decade, a steady flow of Senegalese migrants has embarked on perilous journeys towards Europe. Their reasons for fleeing their homeland are diverse, including political instability, economic hardship, as well as the desire to access higher education and employment opportunities. Italy, in particular, has been one of the main destinations for Senegalese refugees, due to both its geographical proximity to Africa and its historical ties with the African continent. 2. Challenges Faced by Senegalese Refugees in Italy Despite arriving on European soil with hopes for a better future, Senegalese refugees in Italy have faced numerous challenges. Many encounter difficulties in obtaining legal residency and are thus rendered vulnerable to exploitation in the informal labor market. Furthermore, the lack of adequate housing and social support has often forced refugees to live in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, making it even more challenging to integrate into Italian society. Additionally, the increasing political debate on immigration in Italy has greatly impacted the lives of Senegalese refugees. The rise in anti-immigrant sentiment, manifested in policies such as the notorious security decree by former interior minister Matteo Salvini, has further marginalized these already vulnerable individuals by limiting access to social services and exacerbating their isolation from the rest of society. 3. Senegalese Refugees Choosing to Return Home Faced with the harsh realities of life as an undocumented migrant in Italy, a growing number of Senegalese refugees have opted to return to their homeland. This decision is fueled by several factors, including: - Failure to achieve a viable livelihood and stability in Italy - The feeling of isolation and the desire to be reunited with families in Senegal - Limited prospects for gaining legal residency and the constant fear of deportation - Negative experiences of discrimination and stereotyping in Italian society 4. Challenges and Prospects for Returning Migrants in Senegal While the decision to return to Senegal offers hope for a sense of belonging and emotional support, the reality of reversing one's fortunes remains a daunting task. The repatriated Senegalese face numerous challenges upon their homecoming, including: - High levels of unemployment and limited economic opportunities in a struggling economy - Stigmatization and discrimination due to their perceived status as 'failures' or 'unpatriotic' - Limited access to education and skills training to facilitate their reintegration into society Despite these challenges, some programs and initiatives have been developed to support returning Senegalese migrants. Organizations, such as the International Organization for Migration (IOM), are offering assistance in the form of skill-building workshops, financial resources, and psychosocial support to help facilitate a smoother transition back into Senegalese society. Moreover, returning migrants, equipped with the experiences and skills they have acquired abroad, have the potential to contribute significantly to the Senegalese economy. For instance, they may bring back expertise in a range of sectors, from agriculture to technology, fostering innovation and development in their home country. Conclusion The decision of Senegalese refugees to return to their homeland from Italy highlights the magnitude of the challenges they face as migrants in Europe. While this move certainly presents a range of difficulties, it also offers hope for a better future for these individuals and their families. With appropriate support and resources, both globally and locally, returning refugees have the potential to positively impact the socioeconomic landscape of Senegal. This, in turn, may contribute to addressing the root causes of the refugee crisis and promote sustainable development for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who wants a date with a gorgeous girl? , can you please find it? In his first leading role Ben Mendelsohn plays Danny Clark, a bumbling eighteen-year-old guy. He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world. A Jaguar XJ6 and a date with the gorgeous Joanna Johnson (an early role for then 17-year-old Claudia Karvan). Get these and his life will be complete. Unfortunately for Danny, when he finally gets the courage up to ask Joanna out, he somehow manages to promise her a ride in his new Jaguar. She is not particularly impressed by cars, but still agrees to his invitation. The problem is, Danny does not own a Jaguar. His form of transport is his recently received birthday present - and it most certainly is not a Jaguar. His eccentric parents have decided to pass on their pride and joy to Danny for his use. Their 1963 Nissan Cedric has been in the family for years and is immaculate but extremely uncool. Danny is aghast at the thought of driving around in a car as dorky as a Cedric and, with the promise of a date with Joanna and the need for a Jaguar in a hurry, decides to trade in the old Nissan. He heads out to search the car yards to find his dream machine. The answer is:","completion":"Danny Clark is the full name of the person who wants a date with a gorgeous girl, Joanna Johnson."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Tämä taktiikka esti yhteisön toiminnan pitkäksi aikaa ja jätti epämiellyttävän jälkivaikutelman. Saksan liittovaltion panos yhteisörahoitukseen viiden entisen itäisen osavaltion kehityksen tukemiseen näyttää olevan katoava suure. Yhteisörahoituksen osuutta alueiden kehityksessä on aina pidettävä merkittävänä, mutta nyt tuntuu siitä tulevan merkityksetön. Tämä ei ole ainoastaan tulonlähde alueille, vaan myös väline, joka auttaa varmistamaan johdonmukaisen kansallisvaltioiden yhteistyön yhteisön kehitykselle. Thatcher aikanaan käytti eriarvoisuuden ja syrjinnän kysymystä Yhdistyneen Kuningaskunnan ja Euroopan yhteisön rahoituksen välillä pitkittyneenä pelimerkkinä, estäen yhteisötasolla välttämättömät päätökset ja kokoukset. Thatcherin politiikka loi esteitä Euroopan yhteisön toiminnalle ja nimenomaan sen jäsenten välisten taloudellisten resurssien jakamiselle, mikä loi eripuraa ja ongelmia yhteistyössä. Saksan hallituksen muuttaessa suuntaa ja omaksuessaan tämän taktiikan, ne näyttävät haluavan pakottaa Euroopan yhteisön uudelleentarkastelemaan rahoitusjärjestelyjään ja etuoikeuksiaan. Tämä voi estää puolestaan yhteisiä päätöksiä ja aiheuttaa toiminnan hidastumista yhteisön sisällä. Thatcherin aikaisen taktiikan kaltaisen lähestymistavan omaksuminen Saksan hallituksen taholta voidaan nähdä jälkivaikutuksineen pettymyksenaiheena, sillä näin toimien voidaan jättää pysyviä arpeja Euroopan yhteisön yhteistyölle ja suhteellisen hyvälle maineelle. Tällä hetkellä on tärkeää, että neuvottelut ja poliittiset keskustelut jatkuvat kansallisvaltioiden ja Euroopan unionin välillä, jotta päästäisiin rakentavaan ratkaisuun yhteisön kehityksen ja resurssien jakamisen osalta."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},q={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],D={key:0},z={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",q,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
