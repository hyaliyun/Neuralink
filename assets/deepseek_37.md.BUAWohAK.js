Movie title: Tender Mercies Movie plot: Mac Sledge (Robert Duvall), a washed up, alcoholic country singer, awakens at a run-down Texas roadside motel and gas station after a night of heavy drinking. He meets the owner, a young widow named Rosa Lee (Tess Harper), and offers to work in exchange for a room. Rosa Lee, whose husband was killed in the Vietnam War, is raising her young son, Sonny (Allan Hubbard), on her own. She agrees to let Mac stay under the condition that he does not drink while working. The two begin to develop feelings for one another, mostly during quiet evenings sitting alone and sharing bits of their life stories.Mac resolves to give up alcohol and start his life anew. After some time passes, he and Rosa Lee wed. They start attending a Baptist church on a regular basis. One day, a newspaper reporter visits the hotel and asks Mac whether he has stopped recording music and chosen an anonymous life. When Mac refuses to answer, the reporter explains he is writing a story about Mac and has interviewed his ex-wife, Dixie Scott (Betty Buckley), a country music star who is performing nearby.After the story is printed, the neighborhood learns of Mac's past, and members of a local countrywestern band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves in the middle of the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).Mac returns home to a jealous Rosa Lee and assures her he no longer has feelings for Dixie, who he describes as \\"poison\\" to him. Later, Harry visits Mac to tell him, seemingly at Dixie's urging, that the country music business has changed and his new song is no... The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the movie \\"Tender Mercies,\\" Mac's ex-wife is Dixie Scott, portrayed by Betty Buckley. Dixie is a country music star who is still actively performing in the industry while Mac has left his past behind. Mac and Dixie's relationship is identified as a difficult one, where he refers to her as \\"poison\\" to him. Furthermore, Dixie warns Mac to stay away from their daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin), indicating the ongoing tension and unresolved issues between them. In the context of considering an investment in a film, Mac's complicated relationship with his ex-wife Dixie is highly significant. It adds a layer of depth and conflict to the character of Mac, and to the overall plot. The fact that Dixie is depicted as a currently thriving country music star juxtaposes with Mac's transformed life as a reformed alcoholic living with his new wife, Rosa Lee. These contrasting paths that both characters have taken since their separation provide a rich source of tension and dramatic conflict, which could potentially make this film more appealing to audiences and critics. As Dixie is a prominent character in the film and key to understanding Mac's past, the portrayal of her character could significantly impact the film's success. Therefore, if you're considering investing in this film, you should pay close attention to who is cast in this role and how this character is approached by the director and screenwriter. In addition, the character of Dixie provides a bridge between Mac's past and present life, and her introduction into the story evokes feelings of intrigue, tension, and suspense amongst viewers. It offers an insight into Mac's depth as a character, as well as the impact of his past on his present life. Therefore, a well-developed and well-portrayed Dixie character could strengthen the film's narrative and overall emotional impact. For investing in this proposed film, think about not just the characters and the plot, but also other factors like the creative team (their past work, reputation, and artistic vision), the potential audience for this type of story, marketing and distribution plans, and the financial projections and potential return on investment. It often helps to consult with experts in film finance and production, ideally those with experience in the genre or type of film in question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer: Who was the first American in space","completion":"The first American in space was astronaut Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr. Born on November 18, 1923, in East Derry, New Hampshire, Shepard made history on May 5, 1961, when he flew aboard the Mercury-Redstone 3 (also known as Freedom 7) spacecraft during the Mercury Program. His flight marked a significant milestone in the United States' journey toward human space exploration. Shepard's spaceflight came nearly a month after Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to venture into space, on April 12, 1961. The USSR's achievement of sending a man to space ignited fierce competition between the two countries during the Cold War era, fueling the well-known space race. Before becoming an astronaut, Shepard attended the United States Naval Academy and served as a naval aviator. He later became a test pilot, showcasing exceptional flying skills. In 1959, he was selected by NASA as part of its first group of astronauts, named the Mercury Seven. The group included other notable astronauts such as John Glenn and Virgil \\"Gus\\" Grissom. Alan Shepard's historic flight aboard Freedom 7 lasted just over 15 minutes and reached a maximum altitude of 116 miles (187 kilometers). The spacecraft followed a suborbital trajectory rather than placing him into orbit around Earth. During the flight, Shepard experienced brief weightlessness and tested the manual control of the spacecraft, proving that humans could indeed function effectively in the space environment. The successful mission made Alan Shepard a national hero and an invaluable icon in the history of American space exploration. He went on to fly again in 1971 during NASA's Apollo 14 mission, becoming the fifth person to walk on the moon. Shepard retired from NASA in 1974 with the rank of rear admiral in the U.S. Navy. He passed away on July 21, 1998, at the age of 74. Alan Bartlett Shepard Jr.'s pioneering role in American space history, from his status as the first American astronaut in space to his lunar expedition, remains an inspiring testament to human ambition and the power of exploration in expanding our understanding of the universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were requesting he be restrained with leather ones. I had not done any restraining and was asked to assist a woman counselor to show me the ropes (no pun intended). When we arrived in the patients room, I was shocked to see a man in his early 20’s flailing around spasmodically on the bed with his gums bleeding in between his teeth. The nurse informed us that the patient was dying of a liver disease and his body and brain had become toxic, causing delirium. The counselor instructed me to hold down his arms and she placed him in leather restraints which were fastened to the side of the bed. The most upsetting thing which to this day I can not remove from memory was this man literally snapping his jaws at me like a mad animal with traumatized bloody gums from biting so hard on the cloth restraints. There was nothing I, or anyone could do, except keep him restrained from hurting himself or others. It is the kind of witness to suffering I had never experienced before, and I felt almost relieved when the nurse quietly said, “ He will die before morning. “ I suppose what is so traumatic about witnessing such situations is the utter sense of helplessness. I was a trained therapist, and in this situation, I was unable to do anything, and was rendered powerless.

Hypothesis: Jake only has unofficial pets.","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, the hypothesis \\"Jake only has unofficial pets\\" is false. Let us break down the information provided in detail: - Jake had a brother with a snake, which initially belonged to his brother. - The brother never took care of the snake. This implies that the snake was not receiving proper care and attention when it was with Jake's brother. - Jake eventually took over its (the snake's) care. This shows that Jake started caring for the snake and taking responsibility for its well-being. - It soon became Jake's official pet. This statement explicitly contradicts the hypothesis because it indicates that the snake is considered as Jake's official pet. - He (Jake) kept it (the snake) for many years. This reinforces the idea that the snake was Jake's official pet, as he cared for it long term and took responsibility for it.

Every three years, under King Deucalion's order, eight youths are taken from the village to the capital of the Minos' Empire. There, they are placed in an underground labyrinth to be sacrifices to the Minotaur, the Minoan god. Theo, son of Cyrnan, the village chieftain, is haunted by the loss of his love, Fion, in an earlier sacrifice. A leprous prophetess tells him that Fion is still alive in the labyrinth. Against his father's wishes, he replaces one of the sacrifices and is taken to the Minos Empire capitol. Other captives are Danu (Theo's best friend), Morna (Danu's love interest), Tyro (who initially resents Theo because of his standing), Didi (Tyro's love interest), Vena, Ziko and Nan. After the group are dropped into the labyrinth, the Minotaur immediately begins hunting them and kills Nan. The survivors are approached by Queen Raphaella, Deucalion's sister and unwilling lover, who offers them a way out. Vena does not believe her, and when she attempts to leave the group, the Minotaur impales her with its horn. The rest of the group evade the Minotaur and, led by Raphaella, they get to a chamber at the center of the labyrinth. There, the monster lies asleep on its victims's remains, and a heavy wooden door leads out of the labyrinth. Raphaella had arranged for her servant Ramaya to open the door from the other side, but Deucalion catches the servant and has her executed. Desperate, the group attempt to break down the door. The noise wakes the Minotaur, which kills Ziko and splits up the group. Theo, Danu, and Morna encounter Turag, a villager from a previous offering. Turag has managed to elude the Minotaur thus far, but has become slightly insane over the years. Looking at the map of the labyrinth Turag has drawn, Theo learns of Fion's supposed location and goes off alone to find her.

Ask a question about Egypt.","completion":"What were the primary factors that led to the success and longevity of the ancient Egyptian civilization? Ancient Egypt is one of the most fascinating and enduring civilizations in history, and its success and longevity can be attributed to various factors. The following elements played a significant role in shaping the ancient Egyptian civilization, allowing it to thrive culturally, socially, and economically for centuries: 1. Geography and Natural Resources: Egypt benefitted greatly from its strategic location along the Nile River, which provided fertile land, a steady water supply, and abundant resources like papyrus (used for writing) and fish (used for food). The Nile also made travel and communication much more accessible, allowing for easier dissemination of ideas, goods, and people. The surrounding deserts and seas provided natural barriers for protection against foreign invasions, granting the civilization relative peace and stability. 2. Agriculture: Ancient Egyptians were able to harness the annual Nile floods to create and sustain some of the most fertile agricultural land in the ancient world. Sophisticated irrigation and crop rotation systems enabled them to grow various crops, including wheat and barley (used for bread and beer), flax (used for clothing), and fruits and vegetables (used for sustenance). This agricultural abundance supported a large population and helped fuel economic growth. 3. Centralized Government: Pharaohs, who were considered to be both divine rulers and political leaders, governed ancient Egypt. This centralized system allowed for efficient management of resources, infrastructure development, and coordination of large-scale projects like the immense temples and pyramids. The bureaucracy also promoted stability and the smooth transition of power from one dynasty to another. 4. Religion: The belief system of ancient Egypt was deeply embedded in its culture and was intricately connected with the government. The pharaoh and the priest class were responsible for maintaining harmony and balance by performing religious rituals and ceremonies. This unity of religion and state contributed to the overall stability and organization of the civilization. 5. Advanced Architecture and Engineering: Ancient Egyptians built impressive structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza, the Temple of Karnak, and the Sphinx. The knowledge and skill needed for these feats illustrate their mastery of engineering and architecture. These structures also had religious and cultural significance, which encouraged public participation and reinforced societal cohesion. 6. Art, Literature, and Education: Ancient Egypt was rich in artistic and literary achievements. Their writing system, hieroglyphics, allowed them to create records of events, religious texts, and administrative documents. Innovations in art, medicine, and astronomy also contributed to the rich intellectual heritage of their civilization. 7. Trade and Economy: Ancient Egypt prospered through a combination of domestic agricultural production and international trade.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. You are given a background paragraph that describes one or more causal or qualitative relationships such as a relationship in economics or a scientific law and a story that makes use of the concepts or the relationship described in the provided paragraph. You are also given a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph and the story. You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story. In order to correctly answer the given question, you need to understand the relationship mentioned in the background paragraph and should be able to use it to understand that in the story. Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Background Paragraph: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays. Story: Bill and Paul were farmers. Bill used insecticides to get read of aphids, while his buddy farmer Paul didn't. Question: Which farmer used a strong water jet to kill aphids? Output:","completion":"The task asks you to identify which character in the story used a strong water jet to control aphids. The guidelines given in the prompt mention that you need to understand the relationship between the information given in the background paragraph, the story, and the question. Start by reading and understanding the background paragraph. This provides important information about aphid control - that it can be difficult due to their rapid breeding and that one possible method is the use of a strong water jet. This piece of information is relevant to the question because it ties directly into the method mentioned in the question. Then move on to the story. The story mentions two farmers, Bill and Paul, and specifies that Bill used insecticides to control aphids. It does not give any information about the methods used by Paul, which could indicate that he used different methods from Bill, possibly one of the other methods mentioned in the background paragraph such as a strong water jet. To answer the question, combine your understanding of the background paragraph and its advice on aphid control with the information from the story and the roles of the two farmers. The question asks, \\"Which farmer used a strong water jet to kill aphids?\\" Given that Bill has already been identified as using insecticides, the answer would have to be Paul, despite it not being explicitly stated in the story. Understanding that your answer must be a direct copy and pasting of a piece from the prompt, and since Paul's name is mentioned in the story, your output would be \\"Paul\\"."},{"prompt":"I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. good morning How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","completion":"Good morning! In order to provide a detailed and long answer for describing the sentiment of the tweet, I would need the actual content of the tweet. However, I can provide you with general guidelines on how to determine the sentiment of any given tweet. Sentiment analysis is a process of determining the emotion, opinion, or tone expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet. The sentiment of a tweet can be classified into three main categories: 1. Positive Sentiment: If a tweet contains positive emotions, compliments, or supportive content, it can be regarded as having a positive sentiment. Users might share their successes, happy moments, appreciation or gratitude towards others, or express their love for a certain brand or product. 2. Negative Sentiment: A tweet with negative emotions, complaints, or critical content is considered to have a negative sentiment. Examples include users expressing anger, frustration, disappointment, or dislike towards a person, service, product, or event. Negative tweets can have a strong impact on brand reputation and influence public perceptions. 3. Neutral Sentiment: A neutral tweet doesn't express strong emotions or opinions. It may simply convey factual information, general observations, or casual conversations where the user does not exhibit a clear emotional response or stance. To determine the sentiment of a tweet, you can follow these steps: 1. Read the tweet carefully and identify the main message or topic. 2. Check for emotional language, such as adjectives and adverbs, that indicate the user's emotions or opinions. 3. Look for emojis or emoticons that may provide clues about the sentiment. 4. Determine if the tweet contains sarcasm, irony, or humor, as these can affect the intended sentiment. 5. Assess the overall tone of the tweet, considering its context, target audience, and purpose. 6. Categorize the tweet as positive, negative, or neutral based on your assessment. Keep in mind that sentiment analysis can be subjective, and different people might interpret the same tweet differently. Some AI tools and algorithms are available for automated sentiment analysis of social media content, which can provide more consistent results and help analyze large datasets more efficiently. Once you provide the content of the tweet, I can help you analyze its sentiment more accurately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \\"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \\"gentleman in white\\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel. When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization. Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross. The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following statements best describes the actions and motivations of Henry Dunant, the founder of the Red Cross?

Question: Question: what is the name of an investigation with controlled variables I found the following answer on Google: This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control measurements and the other measurements. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is partially correct. The name of an investigation with controlled variables is called a Controlled Experiment or Controlled Scientific Investigation. A controlled experiment is designed to test the relationship between a cause and an effect while eliminating the influence of extraneous variables. This is done by comparing the effect of one or more manipulated variables (called independent variables) on a dependent variable while controlling for all other relevant variables within the experimental setup. The controlled variables are kept constant to ensure accurate comparison, which in turn increases the reliability of the results. The control measurements, as mentioned in the answer you found, serve as a baseline to compare the outcomes of the experiment. In a controlled experiment, there are often two groups: the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group is exposed to the manipulated independent variable(s), while the control group is kept under normal or standard conditions, without being exposed to the manipulated variables. Comparing the results from both groups helps researchers observe any differences in the dependent variable, allowing for a clearer understanding of causality and minimizing confounding factors. In summary, a Controlled Experiment or Controlled Scientific Investigation is an investigation with controlled variables, designed to test cause and effect relationships while minimizing the influence of confounding factors. Control measurements, as mentioned in the Google answer, play an essential role in providing a baseline for comparison and enhancing the reliability of the results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They need positive encouragement, which will help them believe that they can succeed in their lives. This will also give them opportunities to explore and try out new things. If parents yell at their children, the emotional development of them can be badly affected. Though parents think they are protecting their children at all times, the children will not feel safe when they are yelled at. It can be a very bad experience for children. This can make it difficult for children to enjoy parents' presence if they are being yelled at. A person needs to be a good listener and also should learn to give others a chance to talk. When a child grows up with parents who often yell, this will not happen. When parents often yell, their children will also learn the same thing and they will find it natural not to listen to anyone.

She came to this country with her family on a tiny ship during World War I when she was only 8 years old. During the trip she survived stormy seas,little food, and an attack by a German U-boat. After getting here,her large family worked hard to build a new life in America. They never had much money but were rich in love. One day,when I was about 5 or 6 years old, my parents and brothers went on a trip. It was just me and Nanny in the house for the weekend. Nanny seemed so happy to be taking care of me all by herself. She made me a special breakfast that first morning. However, all I could do was to complain about how the food was not how Mom always made it. Nanny quietly put down the plate and went into the living room. I followed a minute later and saw that she had tears in her eyes. It was the first time I had ever seen my strong and proud grandmother cry and I was the one who had caused it. I walked over to Nanny, climbed on her lap, and for the first time in my short life I did something else too. I apologized without being told to and asked Nanny to forgive me.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who threw more touchdown passes, Brett Favre or Tarvaris Jackson?","completion":"Title: Brett Favre vs. Tarvaris Jackson: A Tale of Touchdown Passes Introduction: There has always been a keen interest in the National Football League (NFL) regarding the stats and performances of players. In the case of quarterbacks, one key statistic that fans, commentators, and analysts often focus on is the number of touchdown passes they have thrown. This data point paints a picture of the effectiveness of a quarterback in leading his team to score points and ultimately secure victories. In this article, we explore the careers of two notable quarterbacks, Brett Favre and Tarvaris Jackson, to determine who has thrown more touchdown passes during their time in the NFL. Brett Favre: Brett Favre, nicknamed \\"The Gunslinger,\\" had a celebrated career in the NFL that spanned 20 seasons from 1991 to 2010. Favre spent the majority of his career with the Green Bay Packers before short stints with the New York Jets and the Minnesota Vikings. He is known for his tenacious playing style, impressive records, and passionate approach to the game of football. Throughout his prolific career, Brett Favre showcased his arm strength and remarkable ability to throw touchdown passes. Favre's high level of play and consistency led him to set numerous NFL records, including the most consecutive starts by a quarterback (297) and, until recently, the most career passing yards (71,838). However, for the purpose of this analysis, we are particularly interested in his touchdown pass record. During his time in the league, Brett Favre threw a staggering 508 touchdown passes. This incredible feat was an NFL record until it was later surpassed by Peyton Manning in 2014 and subsequently by Tom Brady. Nevertheless, Favre's total touchdowns remain the third-highest in NFL history, and his impact on the game cannot be overstated. Tarvaris Jackson: Tarvaris Jackson, on the other hand, had a more modest career in the NFL. Playing from 2006 to 2015, Jackson spent six seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, one season with the Buffalo Bills, and three seasons with the Seattle Seahawks. While he may not have attracted the same level of attention as Favre, Jackson’s role as a backup and occasional starter made him an essential part of his teams' offensive strategies. Although Tarvaris Jackson did not amass the same lofty records as Brett Favre in his career, he still managed to carve out a place for himself in the NFL by displaying a strong work ethic and a willingness to learn from coaches and teammates. Throughout his playing days, Jackson threw a total of 39 touchdown passes in the regular season – a respectable achievement for a player who embraced his role as a backup quarterback and contributed to his team's success. Conclusion: When comparing the touchdown pass statistics of Brett Favre and Tarvaris Jackson, it becomes abundantly clear that Favre had thrown significantly more touchdown passes over the course of his career. With an astounding total of 508 touchdowns, Favre's accomplishments on the gridiron far outshine the 39 touchdown passes thrown by Jackson, who found success as a valued backup quarterback. Though their careers may have taken different paths, both Brett Favre and Tarvaris Jackson brought their unique skills and styles to the NFL, and their names will forever be etched in the annals of the league's history. In the end, the comparison between Favre and Jackson highlights the importance of a quarterback's ability to throw touchdown passes as a meaningful benchmark to evaluate their impact on and contributions to the game of football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer to this question? where does mechanical digestion occur in the digestive system?","completion":"Mechanical digestion is a crucial component of the digestive system as it involves the physical breakdown of ingested food into smaller pieces, which will then be further broken down chemically for absorption and utilization by the body. Mechanical digestion occurs in several locations throughout the digestive system, including the mouth, stomach, and small intestine. 1. Mouth: The process of mechanical digestion starts in the mouth. As food enters the mouth, it is mechanically broken down by the grinding and tearing action of teeth, as well as the muscular movement of the tongue. There are four different types of teeth, each with a specific role: a. Incisors - located in the front; responsible for cutting and biting b. Canines - located at the sides; designed for tearing and shredding c. Premolars - found behind the canines; used for crushing and grinding d. Molars - located at the back; serve to crush and grind food The tongue assists in maneuvering the food to be efficiently chewed and mixed with saliva, a fluid secreted by the salivary glands. Saliva contains enzymes that initiate chemical digestion, as well as moistening the food to form a bolus, which is easier to swallow. Chewing and the subsequent formation of a bolus result from a combination of voluntary and involuntary (reflexive) actions. 2. Stomach: After leaving the mouth, the bolus travels down the esophagus through peristalsis, which are coordinated muscular contractions, and enters the stomach. The stomach plays a significant role in mechanical digestion by churning and mixing the ingested food. The thick muscular walls of the stomach contract, and the three layers of muscles (longitudinal, circular, and oblique) work together to create an intense churning motion. This mechanical mixing helps break food particles down further and mixes it with gastric juices to form a liquified mixture called chyme. Chyme will be gradually released into the small intestine, where further mechanical digestion and absorption occur. 3. Small Intestine: Mechanical digestion continues in the small intestine, primarily through segmentation. Segmentation is a rhythmic contraction of the smooth muscles lining the walls of the small intestine. This process repeatedly squeezes and mixes the chyme, breaking it down into smaller particles. The chyme is also exposed to various enzymes and bile for further chemical digestion. The small intestine contains villi (tiny, finger-like projections) and microvilli (minute extensions on the surface of villi) that increase its surface area for efficient absorption of nutrients. The contractions of the gastrointestinal smooth muscles propel the digested food forward, facilitating nutrient absorption by the villi and microvilli. In summary, mechanical digestion begins in the mouth with the action of teeth, tongue, and saliva. It continues in the stomach through churning and mixing, breaking down food particles and forming chyme. Finally, the small intestine carries on mechanical digestion by way of segmentation, leading to the absorption of nutrients by the body. This combination of mechanical and chemical actions ensures that the food we eat is broken down and made readily available for our body's energy and growth needs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Robots Can Be Better Surgeons in the Operating Room When doctors first approached Hormuz Irani, a surgical oncologist based in Bakersfield, Calif., to suggest he participate in the hospital’s robotic-surgery training program, he resisted. He’d been performing laparoscopic surgery since 1995 and heard that the Da Vinci robot was bulky, expensive, and time-consuming. But when he actually started using what he refers to as the “workhorse,” he saw the future of surgery. The optics were clearer. Tremors from his hand vanished because the robot moved in a fluid motion. Smaller incisions left his patients with less pain and shorter healing times. The arms of the robot swiveled 360 degrees, allowing it to do things the human wrist cannot—sew backward, for example, or sew underneath tissue. For more on medical technology, watch this video: “And it’s ergonomic, so you’re not hunched over a patient,” Irani says. “That’s definitely a big plus because we all end up with back, neck, and wrist issues.” The Da Vinci Surgery System was approved by the FDA in 2000, and many more technological advancements have been made since then. Irani sees no sign of that progress slowing, and unlike before, he’s looking forward to it. “A robot could be that much more advantageous to use in the future,” Irani says. “Better, lighter, cheaper.” This article is part of the Future of Work article from Fortune’s July 1, 2016 issue.

Summary:","completion":"Robotic surgery using the Da Vinci Surgery System offers significant benefits for both surgeons and patients, according to Hormuz Irani, a surgical oncologist based in California. After initial doubts, Irani found that the robot's clearer optics, fluid motion that eliminated tremors and ability to swivel 360 degrees led to smaller incisions, reduced pain and faster healing times for patients. Additionally, the technology is more ergonomic for surgeons, preventing long-term back, neck and wrist issues. As the technology improves, Irani expects robotic surgery to become even more advantageous with better, lighter, and cheaper systems in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Imagine that you are the first person ever to see Hawaii. What would be the first thing you would set foot on? The beach, naturally. There are hundreds of miles of beaches on the twenty islands of Hawaii. These islands cover 1,600 miles and are about 2,300 miles west of California. Most of them are covered with fine white sand. They are thought to be among the finest beaches in the world. Another wonderful thing about the beaches of Hawaii is the water temperature. The year-round average temperature of the water at the famous Waikiki Beach is 230C! The same is true of air temperature. In fact, there are no real seasons in Hawaii. There is a difference of only two or three degrees between the hottest day of summer and the coldest day of winter. That's why the Hawaiians don't have a word for weather in their language. Perhaps the nicest thing about Hawaiian beaches are the waves. The earliest settlers in Hawaii, the Polynesians, quickly learned how much fun it was to ride the waves. They developed a sport which is now very popular on the islands called body surfing. You go out into the ocean, wait for a big wave to come towards you, jump on it, and ride it all the way to the beach. Now imagine once again that you are the first person ever to set foot in Hawaii. What do you think would be the second beautiful thing you would notice? Would it be those strange triangles rising out of the water hundreds and hundreds of meters high? What are those beautiful things? They are volcanoes , of course. These volcanoes are not just a part of the islands. They made the islands at first. Because of them the islands are still growing. The most famous volcano on Hawaii is Mauna Loa. It is the world's most active volcano. It has been erupting for thousands of years. Even when it isn't erupting, smoke comes out of the earth from a thousand little holes. In 1950 Mauna Loa erupted for twenty-three days. That erupting produced the greatest amount of lava in modern history. In 1960 it erupted again. That time it added a kilometer of beach to the island. Because Mauna Loa has erupted so often, it has become the biggest (but not the tallest) mountain in the world. These volcanoes could be dangerous to the population of Hawaii. In fact, Hilo, the second largest city in Hawaii, is built just under Mauna Loa. The volcano could erupt at any time. Most people believe that it will erupt sometime in the next twenty-five years. But the people of Hilo do not seem worried. They live with the danger as part of their lives. 1. How many islands does Hawaii have? 2.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Extensive mammographic density is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer and makes the detection of cancer by mammography difficult, but the influence of density on risk according to method of cancer detection is unknown. METHODS We carried out three nested case-control studies in screened populations with 1112 matched case-control pairs. We examined the association of the measured percentage of density in the baseline mammogram with risk of breast cancer, according to method of cancer detection, time since the initiation of screening, and age. RESULTS As compared with women with density in less than 10% of the mammogram, women with density in 75% or more had an increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0 to 7.4), whether detected by screening (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0 to 6.2) or less than 12 months after a negative screening examination (odds ratio, 17.8; 95% CI, 4.8 to 65.9). Increased risk of breast cancer, whether detected by screening or other means, persisted for at least 8 years after study entry and was greater in younger than in older women. For women younger than the median age of 56 years, 26% of all breast cancers and 50% of cancers detected less than 12 months after a negative screening test were attributable to density in 50% or more of the mammogram. CONCLUSIONS Extensive mammographic density is strongly associated with the risk of breast cancer detected by screening or between screening tests. A substantial fraction of breast cancers can be attributed to this risk factor..

The website www.space.com lists the disadvantages of living in space. Here are some of them. When astronauts work outside the station during spacewalks, they have to wear special gloves. The gloves are very tight. They can hurt the astronauts' fingernails and even make them fall off. In space, you don't have many choices in what you eat. It's hard to get fresh fruits and vegetables. It is not OK to eat bread because it leaves crumbs . Crumbs could fly around everywhere. In space, it is impossible to have a good shower because water can fly all over the ship and break the machines. Astronauts have to use a special water-shooting gun and a washcloth. Astronauts lose their bone strength quickly during their stay in space. So far, there is no way to solve this problem. They do exercise while they're in space to try to keep their bones strong as long as possible. Perhaps the hardest part of life in space is the feeling of loneliness. Astronauts sometimes have to spend weeks and even months away from Earth. They miss their friends and families. Options: A By taking medicine. B By doing exercise. C By taking a good rest.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible without the aid of a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. and the situation: Stargazers across the world wait for 2020 when newly discovered very bright Neil's comet would start to pass through the inner solar system On December 21, 2020.

Product review: This is one of the best records in metal history, but why they make this remaster? It sounds bad and...PLEASE BUY THE ORIGINAL RECORDING, DATED IN 1984, WHICH IS A 5 ABSOLUTE STARS ALBUM. Answer:","completion":"This review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The review has delivered strong points criticizing the remastered version of the product which raises serious questions about its quality. I would consider the reviewer's comments as they seem to have enough knowledge on the topic. However, it's essential to evaluate the review critically since opinions on subjective matters like music can differ drastically among individuals. Primarily, the reviewer emphasises that this is a remaster of a well-known record which, according to them, does not stand up to the quality of the original recording. The vehement language used - 'Horrifying remasters' - indicates a significant degree of disappointment, suggesting the changes made in the remastered version have altered or distorted the elements that were appreciated in the original record. As a prospective buyer, it implies that the product might not deliver what is expected, which could diminish my eagerness to purchase it. Moreover, the reviewer advises readers to buy the original recording from 1984, stating it as an '5 absolute stars album'. This further cements the comparison that the remaster is inferior to the original. In this context, it is clearly recommended to seek out the original version rather than purchasing the remastered version, making the purchase of this product less attractive. However, as a consumer, it would be important to consider other reviews and perspectives as well. While this individual found the remaster horrifying, others may consider the alterations an improvement. Layering personal preference regarding music interpretation and recording quality over this review might give a more rounded view. For instance, if I generally enjoy remastered versions because of stylistic reasons, this review might not decrease my tendency to buy the product as significantly. To conclude, this review generally leans towards decreasing the chances of buying the product due to its criticism towards the remastered version and preference for the original. However, personal preference, contrasting reviews and further research on the remastered product should also play a significant role in making a final purchase determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The scheme to bore through the Peak District to improve links between Sheffield and Manchester is feasible, but further investigation is needed. Such a tunnel would result in quicker journey times and avoid delays caused by poor weather in the winter months. Highways England, which produced the report, said a more in-depth study will be ready by the autumn of 2016. The government study looked at the feasibility of tunnelling under the A628 Woodhead Pass, in a scheme which would reportedly cost £6bn. The document says it is possible the tunnel could cut current road journey times by up to 30 minutes and avoid the delays caused by bad weather over the Pennines . The planned new link between Sheffield and Manchester would \\"include a tunnelled section, which could range from between 20-30km (12.4 -18.6 miles), making it one of the longest road tunnels ever built.\\" The authors say: \\"The construction of a new strategic road link between Manchester and Sheffield is technically feasible, although it is likely to include a tunnel (or series of tunnels) that could be longer than any road tunnel constructed in Europe to date.\\" The paper's preliminary findings include: \\"The development of a combined road and rail corridor through the tunnelled section could offer some additional benefits, although road and rail would need to occupy separate tunnel bores and we have not yet established the operational case for this type of solution.\\" Although the paper only looks at the early ideas for such a scheme, Highways England said no means of funding the plan had yet been identified, but there could be a toll levied on tunnel users. The report says: \\"We have not had time yet to do any transport modelling of benefits and costs from a trans-Pennine tunnel. \\"The analysis presented in this report is purely to determine whether there is a case to do more intensive work on investigating tunnel options.\\" Highways officials said the tunnel would need to have an operational life of 120 years and \\"anticipate quite radical changes in technology and tunnel use\\". \\"Our initial conclusion is that, in tunnel sections additional bores would be required to accommodate rail alongside road. \\"Light rail could, in principle, share road space with highway traffic, but low operating speeds and the fact that this mode is more suited to dense urban areas, may make it undesirable.\\" The options in the report are separate from the Department of Transport's £15bn package to transform major roads across England.

If Both cover packages are basically bullish on the stock market., can we conclude that \\"Both cover packages are worthless on the stock market. \\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Both cover packages are worthless on the stock market.\\" just because both cover packages are basically bullish on the stock market. Being bullish means that one has an optimistic outlook for the stock market and expects it to increase in value over time. This sentiment can stem from various factors, including strong economic fundamentals, positive company news, or an encouraging macroeconomic environment. While the cover packages might share a similar outlook, it doesn't inherently mean that they have no value or relevance in the stock market. To better assess the worth of both cover packages in the stock market, we can consider the following factors: 1. Quality of research and analysis: Consider the depth, accuracy, and relevance of the research and analysis provided in each cover package. Thorough and well-researched information can be invaluable to investors, regardless of the bullish sentiment. Check if the information is based on rigorous analytical models, data-driven insights, and a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. 2. Diversification and risk management: Analyze whether both packages provide diverse investment strategies and have adequate risk management techniques in place. A bullish outlook should still include strategies for mitigating and managing risks, enabling investors to protect their investments during downturns. 3. Expertise and credibility: The expertise of the professionals behind the cover packages is crucial in determining their worth. Knowledgeable experts with proven track records can provide valuable input and advice based on years of experience, increasing the usefulness of the cover packages. 4. Timeliness and adaptability: Assess whether both cover packages offer frequent updates and analysis based on new information, indicators, and market trends. Rapidly changing markets may require timely strategies and insights, so the adaptability of the packages can be a key point in determining their worth on the stock market. 5. Customer reviews and support: Look for customer reviews and testimonials to gauge the satisfaction of other investors who have used the cover packages. Quality customer support and easily accessible resources such as educational content and webinars may also contribute to their overall worth. In conclusion, the bullish sentiment of both cover packages is just one aspect of their overall worth in the stock market. A deeper analysis of their research quality, risk management, credibility, adaptability, and customer support is required to accurately assess their value. If these factors align positively, then the cover packages can indeed offer valuable support to investors in their trading and investment activities, regardless of their shared bullish outlook."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: More is spent on jobless in U.S., but benefits near end By Dennis Cauchon, USA TODAY More than 3 million Americans could lose unemployment benefits by the end of July even as the government spends record amounts to compensate the jobless, a USA TODAY analysis shows. The growing number of unemployed workers without benefits comes as Congress argues whether to again extend jobless benefits. The number of people collecting benefits will fall from 10.5 million to 7 million at the end of July if Congress doesn't extend the payments. About 400,000 Americans are exhausting their benefits every week, saving the government 2 billion since June and an estimated 34 billion through November. Unemployment insurance has played a bigger role in this recession — the longest since the Great Depression— than in previous downturns, the USA TODAY analysis finds. This extraordinary response has helped as many as 11 million people at one time — a record — while driving the program's cost to an annual rate of 145 billion in the first quarter. That's more than double what was spent in any previous recession, after adjusting for inflation. Congress has extended unemployment benefits in every recession since the 1950s. The current extension — up to 99 weeks — far exceeds the previous longest extension of 65 weeks in 1975. Economist Chris O'Leary of the non-partisan Upjohn Institute for Employment Research says jobless benefits have never been scaled back with unemployment near 10%. \\"An extension seems appropriate,\\" he says. Labor expert James Sherk of the conservative Heritage Foundation says a more limited extension is needed. \\"Two years is excessive,\\" he says. \\"If you've gone that long without work, there's a range of other anti-poverty programs available.\\" How unemployment benefits have changed: • Higher payments. Cash benefits were paid at a record annual rate of 14,025 per person in the first quarter, about 2,000 more in inflation-adjusted dollars than when the recession started. • Broader coverage. About 70% of unemployed people have gotten benefits in this recession, more than in earlier recessions. • New benefits. A subsidy helps one in seven jobless workers keep medical insurance through former employers. Those benefits, worth about 3,000 for workers who qualify, end when a person's unemployment insurance expires. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Mike (Matt Long), Shelby's ex-boyfriend, has a new girlfriend, Elizabeth (Jessica Stroup), and they are preparing to go to Mt. Bliss, Mike's hometown, because the football team is going to be retiring his jersey. Shelby has problems with the bank about the bowling alley she inherited when her mother died and still believes that she and Mike are still an item. After the football game Mike and Elizabeth decide to go to Shelby's bowling alley. When Shelby sees Mike she kisses him, but Mike tells her that he has a new girlfriend. Shelby befriends Elizabeth and after a few tequila shots, a drunk Elizabeth says she is going to meet Mike's parents after. Shelby then tells her that Mike's parents are over judgmental, making Elizabeth nervous. Wanting to give a good first impression to Mike's parents, Elizabeth decides to go to a motel and sleep her intoxication off, so gets driven to the nearest one from Mike's policeman cousin Billy. As she arrives at check-in, the man behind the counter tells her that there are not any rooms left because of the homecoming football games and the nearest motel is four miles away. Mike goes home to see his mother, who tells him that one of her friends said his new girlfriend got drunk at the alley. Mike tells her that since Elizabeth wanted to make a good impression, she decided to stay at a motel.

Given the context: What does Carson need to do before this? Select from: [-] needed to stop playing soccer [-] practice soccer [-] needed to spend many years practicing The answer is:","completion":"Carson needed to spend many years practicing soccer. In order to achieve a high level of skill in soccer and be good enough to earn a full scholarship to the school of his choice, Carson needed to spend many years dedicated to practicing and honing his skills. This required dedication, discipline, and constant improvement in various aspects of his game. To begin with, Carson must have started playing soccer at a young age, learning the basic rules and techniques of the game. This early foundation allowed him to develop muscle memory, coordination, and understanding of the sport, which enabled him to perform fundamental skills such as passing, shooting, and dribbling with ease. As Carson grew older and continued to practice, he needed to focus on specific areas of the game that would ultimately set him apart from other players. This included working on his individual skills like ball control, shooting accuracy, and physical fitness. Ball control is an essential skill for any soccer player since it allows them to keep possession of the ball and create scoring opportunities for their team. Shooting accuracy is crucial for a player to score goals consistently, a valuable asset for any team. Physical fitness, on the other hand, ensures that a player can maintain a high level of performance throughout the entire match, as well as helping prevent injuries. In addition to individual skills, Carson also needed to develop a strong understanding of the tactical side of soccer. This involved learning various formations and strategies employed by his team and the opposition and understanding his role within these systems. Soccer is a team sport, and being able to work effectively with teammates is essential for success. This required Carson to develop effective communication skills and show a high level of adaptability on the field. Moreover, Carson had to participate in competitive matches and tournaments, both locally and against teams from other regions. These competitive environments helped Carson not only apply and test his skills under pressure but also get noticed by scouts and coaches, which ultimately contributed to his chances of securing a scholarship. To maintain his high level of performance and ensure that he kept improving throughout the years, Carson needed a mindset focused on constant learning and growth. This meant analyzing his performances after each game, seeking feedback from his coaches and teammates, and addressing any weaknesses identified. By doing this, he was able to refine his game and ensure that he remained a top-level soccer player. Finally, Carson had to maintain a healthy lifestyle and discipline, which included proper nutrition, regular exercise, and managing stress effectively. A soccer scholarship is highly competitive, and maintaining peak physical and mental condition is paramount to achieving success. In summary, Carson needed to spend many years practicing and mastering various aspects of soccer to reach the skill level required to earn a full scholarship to the school of his choice. This was achieved through hard work, dedication, and relentless focus on improvement in both his individual skills and his ability to work as part of a team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Meredith was born in 1907 in Cleveland, Ohio, the son of Ida Beth (nee Burgess) and Dr. William George Meredith, a Canadian-born physician, of English descent. His mother came from a long line of Methodist revivalists, a religion to which he adhered throughout his lifetime. Meredith graduated from Hoosac School in 1926 and then attended Amherst College (class of 1931). He left Amherst, and became a reporter for the Stamford Advocate. Early in his career, Meredith attracted favorable attention, especially for playing George in a 1939 adaptation of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and as war correspondent Ernie Pyle in The Story of G.I. Joe (1945). He was featured in many 1940s films, including three -- Second Chorus (1940), Diary of a Chambermaid (1946), and On Our Merry Way (1948) -- co-starring then-wife Paulette Goddard. He also played alongside Lana Turner in Madame X. As a result of the House Committee on Un-American Activities investigation, Meredith was placed on the Hollywood blacklist, and was largely absent from film for the next decade, though he remained involved in stage plays and radio during this time. Meredith was a favorite of director Otto Preminger, who cast him in Advise and Consent (1962), The Cardinal (1963), In Harm's Way (1965), Hurry Sundown (1967), Skidoo (1968), and Such Good Friends (1971). He was in Stay Away Joe (1968), appearing as the father of Elvis Presley's character. In 1975, he received critical acclaim for his performance as Harry Greene in The Day of the Locust and received nominations for the BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Academy Award for best supporting actor. Meredith then played Rocky Balboa's trainer, Mickey Goldmill, in the first three Rocky films (1976, 1979, and 1982). Though his character died in the third Rocky film, he returned briefly in a flashback in the fifth film, Rocky V (1990). His portrayal in the first film earned him his second consecutive nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Meredith played an old Korean War veteran Captain J.G. Williams in The Last Chase with Lee Majors. He appeared in Ray Harryhausen's last stop-motion feature Clash of the Titans (1981), in a supporting role. Meredith appeared in Santa Claus: The Movie (1985), and was a voice actor in G.I. Joe: The Movie (1989). In his last years, he played Jack Lemmon's character's sex-crazed 95-year-old father in Grumpy Old Men (1993) and its sequel, Grumpier Old Men (1995). Meredith directed the movie The Man on the Eiffel Tower (1949) starring Charles Laughton, which was produced by Irving Allen. Meredith also was billed in a supporting role in this film. In 1970, he directed (as well as co-wrote and played a supporting role in) The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go, an espionage caper starring James Mason and Jeff Bridges.

Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Two teams of students studied Earth's atmosphere in class. They also started studying Venus' atmosphere.

He repeated the operation three times, and returned home happily with 60 dollars.

Instead of giving up when faced with adversity, he manages to double his money and repeats the process until he has a considerable sum.

Now, let's simplify the equation by combining the f terms. 1289*f - 11953*f is the same as -10664*f, so the equation becomes: 1,139,770 = -10664*f - 86590 Still with me? Awesome! Now, we're going to add 86590 to both sides of the equation to isolate the f term: 1,139,770 + 86590 = -10664*f This gives us: 1,226,360 = -10664*f To find the value of f, we need to divide by -10664: f = 1,226,360 / -10664 The answer is: f = -115 And that's it!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. First Thoughts: The Four Years War So these insurance cancellation notices. I hear a lot about them. What's the deal? Let's start with the very basics here. About 15 million people purchase health insurance policies on the individual market. That's about 5 percent of the population. When they do so, they typically purchase a 12-month contract with an insurance company. And when that contract runs out, both the individual and the insurance plan have an escape hatch. The individual can decide to no longer purchase the plan -- and the insurance company can decide to no longer offer the plan. Most individuals don't stay in the individual market very long: One study, published in the journal Health Affairs, found that 17 percent of individual market subscribers purchased the same plan for two straight years or longer. There are some restrictions on how insurance companies can terminate products. HIPAA, a health law passed in the 1990s, does require that insurance companies offer subscribers the opportunity to renew their policy, so long as they continue to pay monthly premiums. If they want to discontinue a subscriber's policy, the insurance plan must provide 90 days notice and \\"the option to purchase any other individual health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer for individuals in that market.\\" And these are the notices that insurance plans are sending out right now, to hundreds of thousands of subscribers: notices saying that they do not plan to offer the policy anymore, and information about what policies will be available. So why is this happening right now? Some -- or maybe even most -- of the plans offered on the individual insurance market right now don't meet certain requirements in the health-care law. They may not offer preventive care without co-payment, for example, or leave out coverage of maternity care, one of the health-care law's 10 essential benefits. Some of these plans have stuck around for a little bit. The health law allowed plans that existed back in March 2010, when it became a law, to keep selling coverage. These are known as \\"grandfathered plans:\\" They don't meet the health law's requirements, but as long as they don't change much, insurers can keep offering them. Insurance companies typically do like to change their insurance plans, making changes to cost-sharing or the benefits they offer. That means that grandfathered plans have disappeared. We don't have great data about how quickly this is happening in the individual market, but we do see it in this Kaiser Family Foundation survey of the employer market. These cancellations are, essentially, a lot of grandfathered plans exiting the insurance marketplace. From an insurance company's vantage point, grandfathered plans are a bit of a dead end: They can't enroll new subscribers and are really constrained in their ability to tweak the benefit package or cost-sharing structure. There's not a whole lot of business sense, for a managed care company, in maintaining a health plan that doesn't meet the health law's new requirements. How many people are going to get cancellation notices? It's hard to put an exact number on this, given that insurance plans are the ones who decide whether or not to continue offering an insurance product. Experts haveestimated that somewhere between half and three-quarters of those who currently buy their own policies will not have the option to renew coverage, which works out to around 7 to 12 million people. What does this have to do with Obamacare? Pretty much everything: Since the health-care law required insurance companies to change their plans, this is a direct result of the Affordable Care Act. What do they look like? Michelle Malkin posted a copy of her notice last month, which you can take a look at here. In general, these are pretty much the dull, bureaucratic forms that you would imagine an insurance plan sending out. The federal government did draft some sample language for them to use, although it doesn't really address the fact that the insurance plan isn't being renewed. How did nobody see this coming? President Obama has repeatedly said, since the health law passed, that if people like their insurance they could keep it. Which is a weird promise to make when one of the key goals of the health-care law is to change individual market insurance coverage. There are lots of insurance policies, especially on the individual market, that are really bare bones. Some argue they shouldn't even be called insurance coverage, because their coverage is too sparse to insure against financial ruin. One report from the Obama administration, issued in 2011, found that 62 percent of individual market plans don't offer maternity care. Eighteen percent do not cover mental health benefits and 9 percent do not pay for prescription drugs. The health-care law requires insurance plans to cover all of those things, and then some. This includes spending at least 80 percent of subscriber premiums on medical care (leaving 20 percent for administration and profits), covering 10 benefit categories and providing preventive care without any co-payment. That means insurance companies cannot, under the Affordable Care Act, keep selling the plans that they used to sell -- the ones that don't cover prescription drugs and maternity care. And that means that some people who liked purchasing coverage without maternity care and prescription drugs won't be able to keep those plans. The cancellation notices are a feature of the Affordable Care Act, not a bug. The idea was to make insurance coverage more robust -- and that means cancelling policies that offer less thorough coverage. Who thought that was a good idea? The drafters of the Affordable Care Act! The whole idea of the insurance expansion isn't to get Americans to purchase anything called \\"insurance.\\" It's to get them to purchase a specific kind of insurance, a plan that is relatively comprehensive and helps protect against financial ruin. If Americans were going to be required to buy a product, the reasoning goes, it should be one that can actually do some good. Of course, not everyone agrees with this; some contend that shoppers should be able to continue buying less robust insurance policies and have the option of taking on more financial risk. Does a cancellation mean I'm going uninsured? Nope -- as mentioned earlier, insurance plans are required by law to tell you about other options they offer if they discontinue their policy. That's what the sample language from the administration, above, essentially does. Individuals with discontinued policies will have the option to purchase through the new insurance marketplaces (well, if they start working a little better) or they can do so outside the new marketplaces, pretty much like they have in years past. This will vary a lot from person to person. Some people who are buying a bare-bones plan right now will likely see higher premiums under Obamacare. They'd be getting more benefits -- but paying more in premiums. Some people will get financial help buying that more robust insurance; people who earn less than 400 percent of the federal poverty line (about 45,000 for an individual) can use a tax subsidy to purchase their plan. For more on premiums under the Affordable Care Act, you should read this great piece from Ezra. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The Four Years War is about health insurance cancellation notices, which are being sent to millions of people who have insurance plans that don't meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare). The health law has certain requirements that insurance plans must follow, like covering preventive care without co-payments and including coverage for essential benefits such as maternity care. Many existing plans don't meet these requirements, so they're being canceled and replaced with new plans that do meet the requirements. This is happening because the goal of the Affordable Care Act is to improve insurance coverage and make it more comprehensive, even though it may mean some people will have to pay more for their insurance. If your insurance plan is canceled, you'll have the option to purchase a new one that meets the requirements, either through the new insurance marketplaces or outside of them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Logic test: Bill throws a boulder and a balloon. The balloon falls much slower than the boulder meaning it (A) weighs more (B) weighs less A:","completion":"The answer your students should choose between \\"balloon\\" and \\"boulder\\" in this logic test is \\"balloon\\" which corresponds to option B (weighs less). Let's break down the scenario to better understand the logic: Test Scenario: Bill throws a boulder and a balloon. Observed Fact: The balloon falls much slower than the boulder. The task given to students is to deduce the logical conclusion from the observed fact and choose the correct answer between \\"balloon\\" and \\"boulder\\". According to the forces acting on an object in free fall, primarily gravity and air resistance, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the acceleration due to gravity working on it. A heavier object experiences greater gravitational force, which in turn results in higher acceleration. However, air resistance can also affect the speed at which an object falls, with a larger and lighter object (such as a balloon) encountering more air resistance and ultimately falling at a slower speed. The given logic test presents two options: Option A: The balloon weighs more. Option B: The balloon weighs less. Because the balloon falls slower than the boulder, students are asked to analyze the relationship between weight and the speed at which an object falls. If the balloon weighed more, it would experience a greater gravitational force and, consequently, fall faster. However, this scenario contradicts the observed fact. Therefore, option A is not the correct answer. On the other hand, option B supports the observed fact that the balloon falls more slowly due to it weighing less than the boulder. The lighter weight of the balloon means it experiences less gravitational force and, when combined with the larger air resistance it experiences, results in a slower fall. This aligns with the observed fact and displays the logical conclusion that the students should arrive at. So the correct answer for this logic test is \\"balloon” corresponding to option B (weighs less)."},{"prompt":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the building that Viscount Grey de Wilton laid the first stone for? , can you please find it? Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house. The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument. The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896. The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane. For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Populations may show different patterns of growth. The growth pattern depends partly on the conditions under which a population lives. Two common growth patterns are exponential growth and logistic growth. Both are represented in Figure below . Choices: - migratory and logistic - exponential and economical - organic and inorganic - exponential and logistic A: Answer:","completion":"The two common growth patterns of population mentioned in the paragraph are exponential growth and logistic growth. The growth pattern of a population depends on the conditions under which a population lives. As stated, both exponential growth and logistic growth are represented in Figure below. Let's explore these two growth patterns further: 1. Exponential growth: It occurs when the resources available to a population are abundant, and the population size increases at a constant rate over time. In exponential growth, the number of individuals added to the population during each time period is proportional to the current population size. It is also known as unregulated or unrestricted growth, as there is no limit to the population size and growth rate. The exponential growth can be represented by the formula: N(t) = N(0) * e^(r*t) Where N(t) is the population size at time t, N(0) is the initial population size, e is the base of natural logarithms, r is the intrinsic growth rate, and t is time. 2. Logistic growth: In contrast to exponential growth, logistic growth occurs when the resources available to a population are limited, and the population size reaches an equilibrium. In this case, the population growth rate gradually slows down as the population approaches its carrying capacity (the maximum number of individuals that can be sustained by the available resources). Logistic growth is also known as regulated or restricted growth. The logistic growth can be represented by the formula: N(t) = (K * N(0) * e^(r*t)) / (K + N(0) * (e^(r*t) - 1)) Where N(t) is the population size at time t, N(0) is the initial population size, e is the base of natural logarithms, r is the intrinsic growth rate, K is the carrying capacity, and t is time. In summary, the correct option from the provided answers is \\"exponential and logistic,\\" as these are the two common growth patterns of population discussed in the paragraph. These growth patterns depend on the conditions under which a population lives, with exponential growth representing abundant resources and unrestricted growth, and logistic growth representing limited resources and a state of equilibrium."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can buy sets of cards, or make your own, and carry them with you wherever you go. There's no question this is useful and because you can use them in short bursts, it's not too much for you. It can be fun. I don't recommend drilling for hours at a time with flashcards. If you want to use flashcard software, things get even better. There are many packages out there for maintaining and drilling flashcards. I recommend VTrain though there are many others. One stands out, however: SuperMemo. Similar to Pimsleur, SuperMemo is engineered according to a carefully researched methodology in order to test you on a card the very minimum number of times you need to see it for it to stick. When you look at a card, you give some feedback to the software on whether you got it right and how easy you found it. It uses this information, and that of your previous attempts, to decide when you will be shown the card next. It's smart and it really works. If you're like me, the news is even better! I have a version of SuperMemo that runs on my PalmOS phone. Wherever I am, if I have my phone handy, I have thousands of flashcards with me too. Honestly, it would be worth purchasing a cheap Palm device only for this. You can pick one up for 20 or even less on eBay or elsewhere. Consider it, at least.

Severus Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Draco's mother, Narcissa, to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails. 16-year-old Harry accompanies Albus Dumbledore to visit former Potions professor Horace Slughorn, who has gone into hiding but agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts. Dumbledore then takes Harry to the Burrow, where Harry reunites with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

She'll sit in it for stretches of time together while I walk around doing things that need doing, or will fall asleep in it when I can't get her to go any other way.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: There are some great philosophical questions. What is the purpose of life? What happens when we die? And WHY DO THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS BAD???

Glad I did because (SPOILER?) the last line is the crowning stupidity of the whole dopey, dismal scenario.It is not even worthy of second feature status at a third rate drive-in in off season.

In recent years, downtown retail options have increased with the opening of new stores such as Urban Oufitters, J Crew, Origins, American Apparel, Gant Clothing, and an Apple Store, joining older stores such as Barnes & Noble, Cutlers Records, and Raggs Clothing. In addition, downtown's growing residential population will be served by two new supermarkets, a Stop & Shop just outside downtown and Elm City Market located one block from the Green. The recent turnaround of downtown New Haven has received positive press from various periodicals. How has the media perceive most of these changes to the Downtown area?","completion":"The media has generally perceived the changes to the Downtown New Haven area in a positive light, highlighting the successful revitalization efforts that have greatly improved the quality of life for both residents and visitors. Numerous periodicals and news outlets have provided coverage of the transformation, noting how it has led to economic growth and an enhanced sense of community. Several key areas that the media has focused on include: 1. Economic growth: Media coverage has often emphasized the positive impact of new commercial establishments, such as Urban Outfitters, J Crew, Origins, American Apparel, Gant Clothing, and the Apple Store, on the local economy. These retailers not only bring in revenue and customers, but also contribute to increased property values and tax revenues. Furthermore, the opening of Stop & Shop and Elm City Market supermarkets cater to the daily needs of the growing residential population, further enhancing the appeal of the area. 2. Revitalized cultural and nightlife scene: The media has also praised the growth of the restaurant, nightlife and entertainment industries in the Downtown area. This has not only made the area more attractive to visitors and residents alike but also increased opportunities for new businesses and job creation. The result is a vibrant, bustling atmosphere that attracts people of all age groups and cultures, which can lead to further development and growth. 3. New residential options: The influx of apartments and condominiums surrounding the New Haven Green has received substantial attention from the media as it signifies a shift in the way people are choosing to live in urban centers.

Step 1: To find 's', we need to get 's' by itself. We have the equation -2031728 = -129*s - 2025407 Step 2: Let's add 2025407 to both sides to cancel it out from the right side of the equation. It would be like saying, if you have 3 cookies and I take away 3, you have none left.

To find 's', we need to get rid of the -129 that is multiplied by s on the right side. It's like dividing your candies into equal parts. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -129: (-636321) / (-129) = -129*s / -129 This gives us: s = 4932 And there you have it! So 's' in our equation is 4932. Isn't math fun?

This is the second best burger in the U.S. B&B Burger & Beer was a Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich venture. They had other jointly owned establishments in town, so this provided B&B with enhanced access to stellar ingredients. The beef was a prime example. The beef blend (50% Brisket and 50% Chuck) was ground and blended fresh daily onsite from hand-selected sides of beef from Niman Ranch. The beef was broken down, ground, and blended by the on-site butcher. Yes, these guys had a guy picking out the sides of beef for the burgers. Niman Ranch beef is 100% Angus, vegetarian diet, and no hormones/antibiotic free. The burgers came out at 6 ounces each. The Drive Thru was two 3-ounce patties, and my burger was a single 6-ounce patty. The beef was splendid. The flavor hit us in a rush of sear, beef, salt and pepper, complex mineral notes, and a little blood. The texture was firm and then creamy. The burger patty was perfectly juicy with no trace of oiliness. The beef resembled Stracciatella cheese in its complexity and delicate texture, but the beef brought a sledgehammer of flavor to the palate. This was one of those bites that made me smile and slow down as I savored eat bite. The Drive-Thru Burger was very similar to my Bar Burger, except that burger had twice the sear and twice the cheese. I will be getting that burger on my next visit. The beef was perfect. B&B Burger & Beer is now on my list of top burgers in the country. It edged out the burgers at BurGR on the merit of the sear. This burger was on par with the spectacular cheeseburger at The Brindle Room in NYC. I found myself already missing the burger as took my last few bites.

Summarize this article: When purchasing men’s jeans, look for inseam measurements on the back label. They will typically be listed with waist size first and inseam second, so a pair of pants marked 34x32 will have a 34 in (86 cm) waist and a 32 in (81 cm) inseam. Women’s jeans rarely list the inseam, so you may have to consult a store attendant, make a conversion using the brand’s sizing chart, or measure the seam yourself. Websites like Search By Inseam allow you to find the inseam measurements for popular pant brands. Though compact shoes and sneakers won’t make a significant difference, high heels and similar shoes may. In general, add between .5 and 1 inch (1.3 and 2.5 cm) to your inseam measurement to accommodate raised shoes. If possible, measure your inseam while wearing the raised shoes to get a more precise number. Over time, jeans made from cotton, linen, and wool may shrink, something that will affect the inseam. If purchasing a name brand pair, search online for information on how much you should expect the pants to shrink. If necessary, purchase pants with an inseam that is about .5 inches (1.3 cm) too large, giving the legs room to shrink. Summary:","completion":"When buying jeans, look at the label on the back to find the sizes. For men's jeans, you'll see the waist size and then the inseam length, like 34x32. For women's jeans, it can be tricky because they don't always show the inseam length, so ask someone who works at the store or use a special chart to figure it out. You might need to add a little bit of length if you wear high shoes. Sometimes, jeans can get smaller after wearing and washing them, so check if the jeans you're buying might shrink and maybe buy a slightly bigger size."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen, July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work. At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \\"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\\" She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed 25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992. Chicago is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art. Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \\"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \\"feminine\\". Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively. What did the do there?","completion":"At the Feminist Art Program at Fresno State College and later at the California Institute of the Arts, Judy Chicago and her students engaged in a groundbreaking exploration of art from a feminist perspective. They aimed to develop a new approach to art that represented and celebrated women's experiences, histories, and contributions to society. To achieve these goals, they undertook various activities and created impactful artworks that have left a lasting mark on the art world. Here's a brief overview of what they did: 1. Skill Development:Chicago taught various artistic skills including needlework, painting, sculpture, and other traditional and non-traditional art forms to empower her students to express their unique feminine perspectives in their work. They also experimented with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. 2. Collaborative Art Projects: The students in the program worked together on collaborative projects that highlighted women's shared experiences and challenged the societal norms and expectations surrounding womanhood. One such project was Womanhouse, created in collaboration with Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space dedicated to presenting art from a female point of view. 3. Reading and Discussion Groups: Chicago and her students held regular reading and discussion groups focused on women's life experiences, feminist theory, and women's history. These discussions helped inform their artistic expression and deepen their understanding of the female experience. 4. Renovation and Maintenance of the Studio Space: The students and Chicago contributed to the renting and refurbishing of an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. By collaborating on the creation and maintenance of their workspace, the students in the program established an environment that was truly supportive of women artists. 5. Founding the Los Angeles Woman's Building: In 1973, Judy Chicago, alongside Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building—an art school, workshop, and exhibition space exclusively for female artists. The establishment of the Woman's Building provided women artists with a supportive and nurturing environment in which to create, learn, and exhibit their work. 6. Developing and Displaying Feminist Art: Under Chicago's guidance and mentorship, students in the program produced a variety of feminist artworks that explored themes such as gender, identity, power, and control. These artworks often incorporated traditional feminine art forms and materials, like needlework and fabric, alongside more conventionally \\"masculine\\" techniques like welding and pyrotechnics. By doing so, the artists effectively subverted traditional gender norms and expectations in the art world. 7. Influencing Future Generations: The Feminist Art Program played a significant role in the broader feminist art movement of the 1970s and, in turn, has left a lasting impact on generations of artists who came after them. The program has inspired and influenced numerous artists and art educators to continue examining the role of women in art, culture, and society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs. I am facing a new situation today: Two cities had different energy source. Big city burned fossil fuels cut forests and cleared land, while Blue city used alternative sources of energy. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which city cleared more lands? A:","completion":"From the information provided in the background article and the given situation, it can be deduced that Big City cleared more lands than Blue City. To support this conclusion, let's analyze the activities mentioned for each city: Big City: 1. Burned fossil fuels: When fossil fuels are burned for energy production, they release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates that Big City relied heavily on non-renewable energy sources. 2. Cut forests and cleared land: These activities, especially when combined with burning, again contribute significantly to the increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. By cutting forests and clearing land, Big City decreased the number of autotrophic organisms (such as plants), which actively uptake carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Blue City: 1. Used alternative sources of energy: Blue City opted for alternative, likely renewable, energy sources, such as solar, wind, or hydro power. These sources produce minimal or no carbon dioxide emissions, and as a result, have less impact on the environment and the atmosphere. Considering these activities, it becomes evident that Big City cleared more lands than Blue City. Their dependence on burning fossil fuels, coupled with the removal of forests and land clearance, are strong indicators that Big City took actions resulting in a higher carbon dioxide output. On the other hand, Blue City's efforts to adopt alternative energy sources reflect a more environmentally friendly approach, which would likely involve minimal or no land clearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - Carposinidae , the \`\` fruitworm moths '' is a family of insects in the lepidopteran order . These moths are narrower winged than Copromorphidae , with less rounded forewing tips . Males often have conspicuous patches of scales on either surface ( Dugdale et al. , 1999 ) . The mouthparts are quite diagnostic , usually with prominent , upcurved \`\` labial palps '' , the third segment long ( especially in females ) , and the second segment covered in large scales . Unlike Copromorphidae , the \`\` M2 '' and sometimes \`\` M1 '' vein on the hindwings is absent . The relationship of Carposinidae relative to Copromorphidae needs further investigation . It is considered possible that the family is artificial , being nested within Copromorphidae ( Dugdale et al. , 1999 ) . The Palearctic species have been revised by Diakonoff ( 1989 ) . - A pupa (Latin \\"pupa\\" for doll, plural: \\"pupae\\" or \\"pupas\\") is the life stage of some insects undergoing transformation. The pupal stage is found only in holometabolous insects, those that undergo a complete metamorphosis, going through four life stages: embryo, larva, pupa and imago. - The Lepidoptera is an order of insects that includes moths and butterflies (both called lepidopterans). 180,000 species of Lepidoptera are described, in 126 families and 46 superfamilies, 10% of the total described species of living organisms. It is one of the most widespread and widely recognizable insect orders in the world. The term was coined by Linnaeus in 1735 and is derived from Ancient Greek (scale) and (wing). The Lepidoptera show many variations of the basic body structure that have evolved to gain advantages in lifestyle and distribution. Recent estimates suggest the order may have more species than earlier thought, and is among the four most speciose orders, along with the Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Coleoptera. - Caterpillar is the common name for the larvae of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths). - Copromorphoidea, the \\"fruitworm moths\\" is a superfamily of insects in the lepidopteran order. These moths are small to medium-sized (1050 mm. in wingspan) and are broad-winged bearing some resemblance to the superfamilies Tortricoidea and Immoidea. The antennae are often \\"pectinate\\" especially in males, and many species of these well camouflaged moths bear raised tufts of scales on the wings and a specialised fringe of scales at the base of the hindwing sometimes in females only; there are a number of other structural characteristics (Common, 1990; Dugdale et al., 1999) . The position of this superfamily is not certain, but it has been placed in the natural group of \\"Apoditrysia\\" \\"Obtectomera\\" (Minet, 1991), rather than with the superfamilies Alucitoidea or Epermenioidea within which it has sometimes previously been placed, on the grounds that shared larval and pupal characteristics of these groups have probably evolved independently. It has been suggested that the division into two families should be abandoned (e.g. Holloway et al., 2001). - Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or illumination for concealment, either by making animals or objects hard to see (crypsis), or by disguising them as something else (mimesis). Examples include the leopard's spotted coat, the battledress of a modern soldier, and the leaf-mimic katydid's wings. A third approach, motion dazzle, confuses the observer with a conspicuous pattern, making the object visible but momentarily harder to locate. The majority of camouflage methods aim for crypsis, often through a general resemblance to the background, high contrast disruptive coloration, eliminating shadow, and countershading. In the open ocean, where there is no background, the principal methods of camouflage are transparency, silvering, and countershading, while the ability to produce light is among other things used for counter-illumination on the undersides of cephalopods such as squid. Some animals, such as chameleons and octopuses, are capable of actively changing their skin pattern and colours, whether for camouflage or for signalling. - Copromorphidae, the \\"tropical fruitworm moths\\" is a family of insects in the lepidopteran order. These moths have broad, rounded forewings, and well-camouflaged scale patterns. Unlike Carposinidae the mouthparts include \\"labial palps\\" with the second rather than third segment the longest. The position of the enigmatic New Zealand genus \\"Isonomeutis\\" in this family in uncertain, as it lacks the flimsy cuticle of the pupa characteristic of other Copromorphoidea. With other unusual structural characteristics of the caterpillar and adult, it could represent the sister lineage of all other extant members of this superfamily (Dugdale et al., 1999). The genus \\"Sisyroxena\\" from Madagascar is also notable for its unusual venation and wing scale sockets (Dugdale et al., 1999). - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A conservative blogger is in jail -- arrested for allegedly breaking into a Mississippi nursing home to photograph U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's ailing wife, who is suffering from dementia. \\"It's the worst,\\" says the narrator of a new Cochran campaign ad airing in the final stretch before the June 3 primary, not so subtly pointing the finger at his GOP Senate challenger, Chris McDaniel, trying to stir up voter disgust. This race, one of the nastiest so far this election year, has gotten even deeper in the Mississippi mud than that. Cochran supporters argue the reason the blogger and tea party activist took Mrs. Cochran's picture was to feed questions about the senator and his longtime aide, Kay Webber. Cochran: Quiet pragmatist faces re-election challenge. Conservative outlets that back McDaniel have been all over the fact Cochran rents a basement apartment in Webber's D.C. home, and that Webber has traveled extensively with Cochran on the taxpayer's dime. McDaniel's campaign often forwards these reports to its media email list, while the Cochran campaign calls her trips with the senator part of her job and suggestions of anything untoward are sexist. New ads in nasty Mississippi primary. This Republican primary was supposed to be about the big struggle of ideas within the GOP: a 36-year Senate veteran being challenged by a young tea party-backed opponent who calls the senator a big-spending, out-of-touch Republican too entrenched in Washington. Now McDaniel is fending off questions about whether his campaign was involved in trying to photograph Cochran's sick wife. \\"Our campaign had absolutely no connection to that whatsoever, and the evidence has shown that. What we're doing right now -- we're talking about the issues,\\" McDaniel told CNN in an interview. The next Ted Cruz? But what gave ammunition to Cochran allies is that McDaniel's story about when he found out about the break-in has been inconsistent. When we asked for clarification, McDaniel wouldn't go there, replying, \\"Look, we're going to focus on his record.\\" Three more arrested in Mississippi Senate primary scandal. If McDaniel has his way, he would be the next Ted Cruz, going to the Senate to shake things up -- stick to conservative principles, compromise be damned. \\"We don't have six more years of the status quo,\\" he said. \\"I am not going to Washington D.C. to be a member of the cocktail circuit or to make backroom deals. I'm going up there to fight and defend the Constitution. We don't have time to waste. So with all due respect I would suggest they join me in this fight because they've been silent far too long,\\" he told us. \\"He and I are very different with our ideology. He's a guy that believes in big government. He believes in big spending. He believes in increasing taxes. He believes in increasing his own pay. I am not that guy,\\" McDaniel said. For the tea party movement nationwide -- after a string of primary losses this election year from Kentucky to Idaho -- McDaniel has been its great hope of 2014, the candidate with the best chance of toppling an establishment Republican. Things were looking good for McDaniel earlier this year, especially after Cochran stumbled by telling a local reporter here that \\"the tea party is something I don't really know a lot about.\\" Millions of dollars pouring into Mississippi against Cochran come from a who's who of national tea party groups nationwide: Citizens United, Club For Growth, Senate Conservatives Fund, Tea Party Patriots and Freedomworks. The Sunlight Foundation, a nonprofit group that tracks money in politics, says outside groups have spent 7.6 million on the race, much of it for McDaniel and against Cochran. 2014 midterms: Key races. Fighting back against tea party challenges. But like other Republican incumbents this year, Cochran and his allies are fighting back hard. Henry Barbour, nephew of former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman Haley Barbour, formed a super PAC called Mississippi Conservatives to help Cochran. They have been airing aggressive ads slamming McDaniel as extreme, inconsistent and out of touch with Mississippi's needs. Other traditional GOP groups like the Chamber of Commerce have also come in with ads supporting Cochran, like they have for GOP incumbents in other states this year. Still, Cochran's four decades in Washington have won him loyal supporters. On Memorial Day, Cochran attended an event in Vicksburg. He was invited by the Democratic mayor, George Flaggs, who called him a \\"mentor\\" and \\"great friend.\\" Flaggs told CNN he intends to vote for Cochran in the GOP primary since Mississippi law allows Democrats and others not registered as Republicans to participate. He said Cochran fights hard for Mississippi's needs and calls his seniority -- ranking Republican on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, a big plus for the state. \\"He's a leader; he's a statesman, and he's what we need in Washington. So stay as long as he wants to stay,\\" Flagg said. Republican Briggs Hopson serves with McDaniel in the Mississippi state Senate, and told CNN he likes McDaniel but that Cochran is the \\"best person for Mississippi right now.\\" \\"Seniority can be a plus. People can lose touch and get lazy and all those things but I don't think that's the case with Senator Cochran. He's been responsive to the needs in Mississippi for many years,\\" Hopson told CNN. 'Those days are over' When we put those bipartisan sentiments to McDaniel he responded with an emphatic, \\"come on!\\" \\"I say name one fight Senator Cochran's lead against Barack Obama. Name one time he's raised his voice in defense of conservatism. Name one time he's fought back the liberal agenda. Name one piece of legislation he's authored in 42 years that benefited the conservative cause. Name one thing that he's been outwardly aggressive about. And they can't name one,\\" McDaniel told CNN. \\"Look, there may have been a time for that in 1973 when he first went to Washington. Maybe when Richard Nixon was president that was the thing people did. Those days are over.\\" We wanted to ask Cochran himself why he thinks he should get another six years, after serving 36 in the U.S. Senate and six before that in the House. But Cochran is trying to run out the clock and avoid unforced errors -- and going to head-scratching extremes to avoid talking to reporters like us. We tried to catch Cochran after his event in Vicksburg, but when an aide came out and saw us waiting, they did a bait and switch -- the car they told us Cochran was getting into screeched away without him, while he snuck out another door and left in another car, leaving reporters in the dust. Special coverage: 2014 midterms. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses a highly contentious Republican primary in Mississippi, where conservative blogger and Tea Party activist Chris McDaniel is challenging long-time Senator Thad Cochran. The race, originally meant to focus on ideas within the GOP, has been marred by scandal and mudslinging, including allegations that a McDaniel supporter broke into a nursing home to photograph Cochran's ailing wife. McDaniel's campaign has denied any involvement in this affair and both candidates are backed by significant outside funding. McDaniel aims to be the next Ted Cruz, a staunch conservative unwilling to compromise, while Cochran's long Senate tenure has earned him a great deal of loyalty and support in Mississippi.

Process: - Water from the surface seeps below the soil - The water comes into contact with the rock below - The rock over the years carves through the rock - The space in the rock becomes larger and forms into a cave - As more rather rushes through the cave becomes a cavern. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more space rock in space happens, how will it affect the space in the rock gets bigger. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the given process The original process describes the formation of a cave from water seeping into the ground, interacting with the rock, and gradually carving a cavern as more water rushes through. Process: 1. Water seeps below the soil surface 2. Water comes into contact with rock 3. Rock gets eroded and carved by water over time 4. Space in rock becomes larger and forms a cave 5. As more water rushes through, the cave becomes a cavern Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The hypothesis states that there is more space rock in space, and questions how it will affect the space in the rock getting bigger. Step 3: Analyze if the perturbation affects the process (directly or indirectly) A. Water seeping below the soil surface The presence of more space rock in space does not directly or indirectly affect the water seeping below the soil surface. Water seepage depends on factors like rainfall and soil porosity, which are not influenced by space rocks. B. Water comes into contact with rock Having more space rock in space does not impact the water coming into contact with the rock below the soil. This interaction depends on the depth and composition of the rock layer, which is not related to space rocks. C. Rock gets eroded and carved by water over time While space rock might affect Earth's overall geological processes, its effect on the local erosion and carving of a specific rock is negligible. The influence of space rocks on Earth's rock erosion is inconsequential compared to the primary factors that cause erosion, such as water and wind. D. Space in rock becomes larger and forms a cave and a cavern The presence or increase of space rocks in space will not have a direct or indirect effect on the formation of caves and caverns. These formations depend on the local geological conditions, such as the type of rock, water flow, and time, which are not affected by space rocks. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation (increase of space rocks in space) does not have a direct or indirect effect on the process of water seeping into the ground, interacting with rocks, and forming caves and caverns. The main factors involved in cave formation (water flow, rock type, and time) are independent of space rocks and their presence in space."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In the movie \\"Mystic River,\\" directed by Clint Eastwood and based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, the main suspects and individuals involved with the investigation are: 1. Dave Boyle (Tim Robbins): As you mentioned in the plot summary, Dave comes home one night with blood on his clothes and an injured hand. His wife, Celeste, notices inconsistencies in his story about fighting a mugger. Due to this suspicious behavior and his history of childhood trauma, Dave becomes a primary suspect in Katie's murder. 2. Brendan Harris (Tom Guiry): Brendan is secretly dating Katie, which makes him a possible suspect as well. The police might investigate him as a potential suspect in the case, especially if they discover that they had secret plans the day after Katie's disappearance. 3. Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn): Although Jimmy is Katie's father, his criminal background and connections to former associates in crime could bring up suspicions about his potential involvement in the murder. 4. Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon): As a detective working on the case, Sean may find himself suspected by his colleagues, especially if they learn about his strained relationship with his wife. They may question whether his personal life is affecting his judgement and the integrity of the investigation.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Step 2: Evaluate each choice (i) Can be worn as a hat Wearing a broom as a hat does not seem to contribute to the function of cleaning. In fact, it may prove challenging to use the broom for sweeping if it is worn as a hat. (ii) Can have a hat hung on it This choice allows a hat to be hung on the broom, which does not seem to directly enhance the cleaning function. However, it does not hinder the broom's primary function either. It could also help in storing the hat while using the broom for cleaning. Step 3: Determine the better solution Based on the evaluation, choice (ii) can have a hat hung on it, is the better solution for the goal of using a broom. This option does not hinder the primary function of the broom and could even provide additional utility in storing a hat.

If \\"Two women playing field hockey.\\", can we conclude \\"Two women swimming in the ocean.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Two women swimming in the ocean.\\" based on the given statement, \\"Two women playing field hockey.\\" The reason is that these are two entirely different activities and contexts. Let's analyze both situations in detail to understand why we cannot reach this conclusion. 1. Two women playing field hockey Field hockey is an outdoor team sport played on a grass or turf field, with the objective of scoring goals by hitting or pushing a small ball using a hook-shaped stick. The involvement of two women in this activity implies that they are both participating in a field hockey match or practice. It could be a professional game, a recreational event, or a friendly match among friends. In this scenario, we can infer several aspects: - The two women are most likely wearing appropriate clothing, such as shorts, a sports shirt, and protective gear like shin guards and mouthguards. - They are using field hockey sticks, specifically designed for this sport, and playing with a ball. - They are likely following the rules of field hockey, which dictate how the game is played, including team size, field markings, and goal-scoring requirements. - The level of physical activity for both women might be moderate to high, as field hockey involves constant running, maneuvering, and competing against opposing team members. 2. Two women swimming in the ocean Swimming in the ocean suggests a recreational or leisure activity wherein the two women might be having a relaxing time in the sea, swimming, and enjoying the water. It could also be that they are practicing their swimming skills or engaging in water sports like surfing, snorkeling, or scuba diving. In any case, the context is very distinct from playing field hockey. Some aspects we can infer from this scenario: - The women are likely wearing appropriate swimwear (e.g., swimsuits or wetsuits), depending on the specific activity and water temperature. - Their purpose for swimming can range from exercise to relaxation or even learning a new water-based skill. - The activity level might differ significantly from playing field hockey, as swimming involves various techniques and levels of physical exertion. Given these distinct differences between the two scenarios, it is not possible to conclude that \\"Two women swimming in the ocean.\\" based solely on the information that \\"Two women playing field hockey.\\" The activities, equipment, attire, and environments are entirely different, making it an invalid conclusion in this case."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: \\"Hey, guy.\\" \\"No, this is Ray.\\" He smiled, leaned back in his chair. It was, of course, Pete. Pete was the night shift guy at Crossroads Detox across town. Ray called it the Jesus Shop because it was wholly supported by a contingent of local churches who saw addicts as a potential ministry. Apparently Jesus saved--not only from sin and hell, but also from Dark Eyed Jim Beam. Pete was a relatively innocuous born again fundie who volunteered his time two or three nights a week. When he was not saving the world, his Clark Kent was actually a steady CPA job with the local H&R Block. He'd been pulling shifts for about six months, knew nothing about drugs beyond that bad people used them to escape their problems and that they were tools of Satan, and he always needed Ray's advice about one thing or another. This arrangement was not problematic as Pete had long ago given up trying to convert him. Pete was also the only guy in the city who was, as Ray figured it, making less money than he was at such an hour. In return for Ray's magnanimity, Pete had done Ray's taxes for free last year. They had never actually met, though Ray had faxed him the tax forms and Pete had faxed back a photo of his two pre-teen daughters and his geriatric Lab. \\"What's the problem?\\" Ray asked. \\"I have a recalcitrant.\\" That's what he called them, the drunk and definitely disorderly.

Article: Thousands of cities around the globe turned off their lights for an hour to mark Earth Hour 2014, a symbolic show of support for the environment organized by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Since the movement began in Sydney, Australia, in 2007, it has spread to more than 7,000 cities across more than 160 countries. Singapore continues to hold one of the world's largest lights-off events, drawing around 9,000 people this year to Marina Bay Sands, a commercial center typically awash in electricity. To mark the event actors Andrew Garfield, Jamie Foxx, Emma Stone and a group of other famous stars from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie were in town. Other iconic landmarks that fell dark included the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok's Wat Arun temple, the Empire State Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Sydney Opera House, Red Square in Moscow, the Bird's Nest in Beijing and Hong Kong Harbor. As the movement has grown, more organizations and business have committed to switching off their lights in support of efforts to reduce their environmental footprint. In Singapore, at least 600 organizations and companies agreed to either switch off their lights or participate in movements to use fewer plastic bags, take shorter showers, turn up their air-conditioning units or switch to LED lighting. This year the World Wide Fund for Nature, which first launched worldwide Earth Hour, also launched Earth Hour Blue, a crowdfunding platform aimed at raising money for environmental projects around the globe.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 3129*c = -5233*c + 1061974 for c, we will first add the terms with c on one side of the equation and isolate the term without c on the other side. Here are the steps to do that: Step 1: Add 5233*c to both sides of the equation to eliminate the c term from the right side: 3129*c + 5233*c = -5233*c + 5233*c + 1061974 8362*c = 1061974 Step 2: Now, we have an equation in the form of Ac = B, where A = 8362 and B = 1061974. To find the value of c, we will simply divide both sides of the equation by A (8362): c = 1061974 / 8362 By performing the division, we get: c ≈ 126.894 (rounded to three decimal places) So, the solution to the equation 3129*c = -5233*c + 1061974 is c ≈ 126.894."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael McDermott, 68, from Waterford, Ireland, was found guilty last month. His crewmates, David Pleasants, 57, from Grimsby, and Gerald Van de Kooij, 27, from Amersfoort, Netherlands, were sentenced to 14 years and 12 years respectively at Bristol Crown Court. Their boat was intercepted and brought into Falmouth, Cornwall in August 2016. Pleasants and Van de Kooij had previously pleaded guilty but the three were sentenced together. For more on The Bianca and other Cornwall and Devon stories Their trawler, the Bianca, had cocaine weighing 939kg, with a street value of more than £80m, when it was seized by National Crime Agency (NCA) and Border Force officers on August 18 last year. It was the biggest single seizure of cocaine in the country last year. Thirty-eight bales of cocaine were found hidden under bags of sand and gravel in the boat's fish hold, in what is believed to be the third biggest-ever haul of the drug in British waters. It is believed the drugs were taken on board from another boat off the southern coast of Ireland. Speaking after McDermott's trial, Mark Harding, senior investigating officer from the NCA's border investigation team, said: \\"This was a huge quantity of cocaine, the biggest single seizure made in the UK in 2016. \\"Michael McDermott used his specialist skills as a sailor to attempt to evade border controls.

The mighty fane, with its three massive towers, rises majestically over the red roofs of the town. Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

Process: - Electromagnet creates magnetic field with electricity - Conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electric current gets introduced from power source - Flows through the wire - Magnetic field gets created in the wire - And the metal gets magnetized - When turned off it is no longer magnetic. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more copper wire is wound happens, how will it affect a STRONGER electromagnet. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis proposed states that more copper wire is wound around the core of the electromagnet, and we'd like to determine if this perturbation would have a direct or indirect effect on the overall process by leading to a stronger electromagnet. To reiterate, the process of creating an electromagnet involves: 1. A conductive copper wire is wrapped around a piece of metal, typically an iron or steel core. 2. An electrical current is introduced to the copper wire from a power source. 3. This current flows through the wire, producing a magnetic field within the wire and in the vicinity of the metal core. 4. The metal core becomes magnetized due to this magnetic field. 5. When the current is turned off, the metal core loses its magnetism. Now, let's analyze the proposed perturbation of increasing the amount of copper wire wound around the core and its potential effects on the process. A stronger electromagnet can be achieved by amplifying one or more factors that contribute to the strength of its magnetic field. There are three main factors: 1. The amount of current flowing through the wire. 2. The number of turns (loops) of the wire around the metal core. 3. The type of material used as the metal core. The perturbation hypothesis focuses on the second factor – the number of turns of copper wire around the metal core. By increasing the number of turns of wire, the resulting magnetic field created in and around the wire will be cumulatively stronger. This is because each turn of wire contributes to the overall magnetic field, and as more turns are added, the magnetic field lines become denser within the metal core. As a result, the core becomes more strongly magnetized. Hence, the proposed perturbation indeed has a direct effect on the process of creating an electromagnet. Increasing the amount of copper wire wound around the core, and consequently the number of turns, will lead to a stronger magnetic field. This, in turn, will create a stronger electromagnet as more of the metal core material becomes influenced by the enhanced magnetic field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (Urdu/Punjabi: myN mHmd nwz shryf, born 25 December 1949) is a Pakistani businessman and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan from 2013 until he was disqualified for life from office by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in 2017. He had previously served as the Prime Minister twice in the 90s (1990-93 and 1997-99) and the Chief Minister of Punjab from 1985 to 1990. He is Pakistan's longest-serving prime minister. Born into the upper-middle class Sharif family in Lahore, he is the son of Ittefaq and Sharif Group founder, Muhammad Sharif, and the elder-brother of three-time elected Punjab Chief Minister, Shehbaz. On 7 November 1990, the newly elected prime minister announced his nuclear policy and in public television, Sharif responded that: \\"The peaceful [atomic] programme of which... it would be accelerated to accommodate growing [nuclear] [e]nergy needs and to make up for rising [oil] prices. And, of course, (Pakistan) will to construct new nuclear power plants.\\" On 26 November, Sharif authorised talks with the US to solve the nuclear crises after the US had tightened its embargo on Pakistan, prompting Sharif to send his government's Treasure Minister Sartaj Aziz to held talks on Washington. It was widely reported in Pakistan that the US Assistant Secretary of State Teresita Schaffer had told the Foreign Minister Shahabzada Yaqub Khan to halt the uranium enrichment programme. In December, France's Commissariat a l'energie atomique agreed to provide a commercial 900MW power plant, but plans did not materialise as France wanted Pakistan to provide entire financial funds for the plant. On December, the financial embargo was placed and the country's economy felt a distress that prompted Sharif to replace his Treasure minister. Sharif then used Munir Ahmad Khan to have convinced IAEA to allow Pakistan for a nuclear plant in Chashman where Khan intensively lobbied in IAEA for the nuclear power plant. In December 1990, IAEA allowed Pakistan to established CHASNUPP-I, signed with China; the IAEA also gave approval of upgrading of the KANUPP-I in 1990. During his first term, Sharif intensified his non-nuclear weapon policy and strictly followed the policy of deliberate nuclear ambiguity which was also continued by Benazir as well. Responding to US embargo, Sharif publicly announced that: \\"Pakistan possessed no [atomic] bomb... Pakistan would be happy to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) but it must be provided \\"first\\" to India to do the same.\\" Sharif intensified his move to enhance the Pakistan's integrated nuclear development and authorised projects that seemed to be important in his point of views.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? its sheer dynamism","completion":"The phrase \\"its sheer dynamism\\" can generally be considered as positive, but its precise meaning depends heavily on the context in which it is used. To analyze the phrase, let's break it down into two main components: \\"sheer\\" and \\"dynamism.\\" 1. Sheer: Sheer is an adjective usually used to emphasize the degree or extent of a particular quality. In this instance, it accentuates the level of dynamism. It can convey the sense of something being pure, intense, or extreme, implying that there is no ambiguity or doubt about the level of dynamism being described. 2. Dynamism: Dynamism is a noun that refers to the quality of being dynamic, energetic, forceful, or vigorous. It suggests active change, progress, and growth. It is often associated with powerful movement, innovation, and forward-thinking approaches. Now, combining these two components, we can see that \\"its sheer dynamism\\" refers to an almost unadulterated or intense degree of energy, activity, and progress. This association with intense force and enthusiasm is generally seen as positive due to the implication of success, growth, and accomplishment. The phrase suggests that the subject (denoted by \\"its\\") is remarkable and deserving of attention and praise based on its strong dynamic qualities. However, context plays a crucial role in determining whether the phrase will be regarded as positive or negative. In situations where the energy and vigor are seen as desirable traits, the phrase will be viewed positively. For example, when describing a thriving business environment or a captivating work of art, \\"its sheer dynamism\\" would likely be perceived as an attribute contributing to the subject's appeal and success. On the other hand, if the intense level of activity and forcefulness are perceived as harmful, chaotic, or overwhelming, the phrase could take on a negative connotation. For instance, if the description relates to an unmanageable workload or a volatile social situation, the phrase might not be viewed as entirely positive due to the possible negative effects of such excessive energy. In conclusion, \\"its sheer dynamism\\" can generally be considered a positive phrase as it highlights exceptional energy, progress, and activity. However, it is essential to pay attention to the context and subject in question, as the precise interpretation may differ based on the situation and desired outcome."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The planet Sirius 6B, once a thriving mining hub, has been reduced to a toxic wasteland by a civil war between the mining company, known as the New Economic Bloc (NEB), and the Alliance, a group of former mining and science personnel. Five years into the war, Alliance scientists created and deployed Autonomous Mobile Swords (AMS) â artificially intelligent self-replicating machines that hunt down and kill NEB soldiers on their own. They are nicknamed \\"screamers\\" because of a high-pitched noise they emit as they attack. Screamers track targets by their heartbeats, so Alliance soldiers wear \\"tabs\\" which broadcast a signal canceling out the wearer's heartbeat and rendering them \\"invisible\\" to the machines. A fragile stalemate is in effect between the two exhausted, poorly supplied, and undermanned armies. A message guaranteeing safe passage through NEB territory to discuss a truce is recovered from a dead NEB soldier, killed by screamers as he approached the Alliance compound. When Alliance commanding officer Joe Hendricksson (Weller) reports this development to his Earth-based superiors, he is told that such a meeting won't be necessary; peace negotiations are already underway on Earth. Not true, says Private \\"Ace\\" Jefferson (Andrew Lauer), newly arrived from Earth.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive.

Q: Sentence: In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited Düsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \\"a very agreeable day\\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzińskis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \\"a perfect musician\\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodziński family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzińska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her. Question: Where were Frédéric's parents located at when he saw them for the final time in 1835? A:","completion":"Frédéric's parents were located in Carlsbad when he saw them for the final time in 1835."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Teen self-harmed after Vic prison transfer A juvenile offender harmed himself after he was sent to a Victorian adult maximum security prison before it was ready to house children. Lawyers for 12 youth offenders are challenging the state government's decision to transfer them to Barwon maximum security prison after riots at two youth detention facilities. The teens are among a group of offenders as young as 16 transferred to the Grevillea unit within Barwon prison in November after riots damaged the Malmsbury and Parkville youth detention facilities. One of the 40 teens transferred to the Grevillea unit used a piece of equipment to self-harm before authorities had finished removing items of risk, the Victorian Supreme Court heard on Tuesday. These items are still being removed, a Department of Health and Human Services manager says. Grevillea is being operated as a youth remand centre and youth justice custodial centre by the DHHS. The department's director of secure services, Ian Lanyon, admitted issues with Grevillea's facilities have resulted in behavioural problems. \\"There were some infrastructure issues at Grevillea that had meant that some clients' behaviour had escalated,\\" he told the trial. Mr Lanyon confirmed access to sunlight and recreational areas were temporarily restricted while renovations to the unit's facilities were completed. Some juveniles were in lockdown for 23 hours a day, or spent more time inside their cells than outside them. Several of the 40 youths who were transferred to Grevillea are accused of being ringleaders in the Malmsbury and Parkville riots. None have been found guilty of rioting charges, and all the youths are on remand for other alleged offences. Mr Lanyon said he did not speak to the juveniles about their transfer, or to their lawyers. Matthew Belleville, who signed off on the group's transfer, told the court he had never been to Grevillea. \\"The basis on which I thought they should be transferred was that they had engaged in rioting behaviour,\\" the acting general manager of the Parkville youth justice facility said. Mr Belleville also said he was unaware the teens had been warned they would be met with capsicum spray, tear gas, firearms and dogs if they acted up. Counsel for the youths, Brian Walters QC, said the teens had received a note warning them that \\"any violent, dangerous or destructive behaviour, including property damage\\" could result in intervention from Barwon prison's riot squad. The Human Rights Law Centre and the Fitzroy Legal Service say Barwon prison is no place for children because they cannot access the educational or rehabilitation programs usually provided in youth detention. The trial before Justice Greg Garde will resume on Wednesday. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"A juvenile offender self-harmed after being transferred to an adult maximum security prison in Victoria, Australia, which was not yet prepared to house children.

TEXT: \`\` you 're probably right . '' at the door , sybel turned to me one last time and said , \`\` i 'm glad you made it back . i really am . but you 'll find it 's changed out there . it 's no longer the same place . '' \`\` what do you mean , it 's","completion":"changed?'' I asked, my curiosity piqued by Sybel's statement. She sighed and looked at me with a mixture of sadness and concern. \`\`Well, where do I start?'' she mused, as she leaned against the door frame. \`\`The world you remember has been altered in many ways. The passage of time, coupled with the events that have taken place while you were away, has caused a shift in the social, political, and economic landscape. People's perspectives and priorities have evolved, and with that, the world has transformed into something quite different from the one you knew before.'' I furrowed my brow in confusion, trying to imagine what could have caused such a metamorphosis. Sybel took a deep breath and continued. \`\`First, the political landscape has altered drastically. Long-standing alliances have crumbled, and new powers have emerged to fill the vacuum left behind. Conflicts between nations have given rise to social unrest, with many people displaced from their homes, seeking refuge in different parts of the world. This has led to a rise in nationalism and xenophobia, as well as increased division within societies.'' \`\`On the other hand, there are also movements focused on unity and cooperation – those who believe in the power of community and solidarity to overcome the many challenges that the world faces. This struggle between opposing ideologies has created a vastly different political climate than the one you remember.'' I listened intently, trying to absorb the enormity of these events. Sybel gave me a moment before continuing. \`\`Economically, the gap between the rich and the poor has widened. Technological advancements have brought about an automation revolution, changing the job market and displacing many workers. This has led to fierce competition for careers and resources, further dividing societies on the basis of wealth and privilege.'' \`\`In many parts of the world, people struggle to access basic necessities like clean water, food, and shelter, while others enjoy lavish lifestyles. This disparity has given rise to social movements that challenge the status quo, seeking to redistribute wealth and establish more equitable systems.'' I could see the weight of these words on her face, the disappointment and frustration she felt with these developments. She pressed on. \`\`The environment has also suffered immensely. Climate change is an ever-present threat, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly common. Disappearing ice caps, rising sea levels, and devastating natural disasters have taken their toll on the world population and ecosystems alike.'' \`\`There are many who have recognized the need for urgent action and are working tirelessly to combat climate change, preserve endangered species and habitats, and promote a more sustainable way of life. But still, there are others who deny the reality of our global crisis, obstructing meaningful change and perpetuating the destructive status quo.'' Sybel paused, her expression a combination of disappointment and determination. She locked her gaze with mine. \`\`It's a lot to take in, I know. The world you return to may not be the same one you left behind, but it's important to remember that with change comes opportunity. There is still beauty, hope, and inspiration out there – it's up to us to seek it, embrace it, and use it to make a difference in our lives and those of others.'' \`\`So, while the world has indeed changed, so, too, can we adapt and contribute to a brighter future. It's up to you to find your place in this new world and be part of the change you wish to see.'' With that, Sybel smiled softly, offering me both encouragement and comfort in the face of such overwhelming revelations. She stepped back from the door, nodding for me to step out and embrace this transformed world. And as I ventured forth, I took her words to heart, vowing to make a difference, no matter how small, in a world that was no longer the same, but still brimming with possibilities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The University of Kansas men's basketball team squeaked by Ohio State late Saturday night, setting up an an NCAA tournament championship showdown with top-seeded Kentucky. Hours earlier, Kentucky defeated Louisville in its own semifinal. The Wildcats and the Jayhawks will play Monday night for the title at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. Both teams squared off earlier in the year with Kentucky pulling off a 75-65 win. Under coach John Calipari, Kentucky posted a 32-2 record over the course of this season -- with its only losses coming at the hands of Indiana and Vanderbilt, the latter coming in the Southeastern Conference tourney. It entered the 68-team NCAA tournament as the No. 1 seed in the South bracket, and the favorite to win it all in the eyes of many pundits. The team was led by Anthony Davis, a freshman who was recently named the Associated Press college basketball player of the year. But a win in Saturday's contest against Kentucky's in-state rival, Louisville, was hardly a given. The Cardinals, for one, had a head coach with a national title to his credits -- Rick Pitino, who ironically won that distinction in 1996 as head coach at Kentucky. Louisville entered the NCAAs with momentum after winning the Big East Tournament. The Cardinals battled the Wildcats tough throughout Saturday's game, tying the score, 49-49, at one point early in the second half. But the Wildcats eventually pulled away, winning by a 69-61 margin. Ohio State and Kansas entered the night's second tilt as No. 2 seeds, having both defeated the top seeds in their brackets -- Syracuse and North Carolina, respectively -- in the Elite Eight. The Jayhawks were paced by forward Thomas Robinson, this season's lone unanimous AP All-American pick. On the other side of the court was the Buckeyes' Jared Sullinger, who himself earned first-team honors for the second straight year. On Saturday night, Ohio State jumped ahead early, carrying a 34-25 advantage into the half. But Kansas stormed back after the intermission, notching the game up at 38-38 with 14 minutes left in the game. The rest of the game was nip-and-tuck, with rarely more than a few points separating the two teams and several lead changes in the final minutes. Kansas edged ahead with just over a minute to go and held on, thanks to some pivotal free throws and an Ohio State lane violation call, for a 64-62 victory. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The University of Kansas men's basketball team won a close game against Ohio State, and will play in the championship game against Kentucky. Kentucky had earlier won a game against Louisville. Both Kansas and Kentucky are very good teams with talented players.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera.

They rang louder when a title card referred to America's Civil War as the 'War Between the States' (the circumlocution preferred by die-hard southerners). Jesse James -- thief, slave-holder and murderer -- is described as a quiet, gentle farm boy. How dishonest is this movie? There is NO mention of slavery, far less of the documented fact that Jesse James's poor widdered mother owned slaves before the war, and that Jesse and his brother Frank actively fought to preserve slavery. According to this movie, all those Civil War soldiers were really fighting to decide whether Missouri is a northern state or a southern state ... that's ALL. (Missouri: It's a candy mint! It's a breath mint!) Black people are entirely absent from this movie, except for two glimpses of a pair of beggars, one of whom wears a \\"HELP THE POOR\\" sign that's very implausibly typeset instead of handwritten. (Some shots of 19th-century newspapers are inaccurate too, with 20th-century type fonts.) This film has a weird flashback structure. There's some very impressive stunt riding (and some fine work by stunt horses), and one excellent montage. I savoured one line of dialogue: 'Some of those boys will never taste beans again.' The movie gets a few facts straight: Agnes Moorehead, as Jesse's mother, conceals her right arm in the scenes following the raid by the agents of Pinkerton (here called 'Remington') in which Jesse James's real-life mother suffered injuries requiring the amputation of her lower arm. Some errors here are pardonable: during his bushwhacking days, the real Jesse James accidentally shot off part of his left middle finger, but Robert Wagner (in the title role here) does not have a stumpfinger. I've seen a photo of Jesse James's real wife; if she had looked half as glamorous as Hope Lange looks in this movie, Jesse James might have stayed home more. There's plenty of revisionism here, and most of the male actors wear 1950s hairstyles. But many of this movie's errors were avoidable. Jesse James's mentor William Quantrill is mentioned several times, but all the actors mispronounce his name. We see Jesse and his wife moving into an elaborate two-storey house (where he will soon die) after paying a rent of 18. Actually, Jesse James's last residence (at 1318 Lafayette Street, St Joseph, Missouri) was a simple one-storey cottage, renting for 14. There was no upper storey ... so, when Jesse James is killed, his wife could not come running from upstairs as Hope Lange does here. (She was actually in the kitchen.) One continuity error: Robert Wagner (with no stunt double) does an impressive job of taking a slug to the jaw and falling over while his hands are tied behind his back ... but when he gets up, the rope binding his wrists has vanished. The screenplay does some weird and unnecessary juggling of dates. Following the Northfield robbery attempt, Jesse says he expects to get home by his birthday. The actual Northfield bank raid by the James Gang (7 September, 1876) was two days AFTER Jesse James's birthday. (Maybe he meant next year's birthday.) Later, we see Jesse and his wife moving into their St Joseph home on a fine summer day, while Jesse tells her what he plans to do when Christmas Eve arrives ... but in real life, Mr and Mrs Jesse James moved into that house on 24 December, 1881 ... so this scene should *BE* on Christmas Eve! These errors were entirely avoidable. Some of the fictionalisations here don't make sense. According to this movie, the Northfield bank raid failed because one (fictional) henchman was late in cutting the telegraph wires. If this had actually happened, it would indeed have hampered the James Gang's getaway ... but it wouldn't have affected the robbery itself, which failed for other reasons. There are good performances here by Jeffrey Hunter (as Frank James), Moorehead, Alan Hale Jnr (as Cole Younger) and by stage actress Marian Seldes in a rare screen role. I was disappointed by Robert Wagner, normally an under-rated actor. Elsewhere, Wagner has proved his impressive range by convincingly portraying heroes, villains and morally ambiguous characters. Here, he can't seem to decide whether to depict Jesse James as a goodie or a baddie ... so he doesn't much bother. John Carradine phones in his performance in a brief role as a fictional jackleg preacher who baptises Jesse and his wife at their wedding. In fact, Jesse James was baptised in childhood by his uncle, a Methodist minister ... but perhaps this second baptism is a topping-up. Jesse James was no Robin Hood. (I doubt that Robin Hood was Robin Hood either, but that's another story.) There is not one single documented instance of Jesse James ever sharing his loot with anyone beyond his own family. After some of his hold-ups, he didn't even split the swag with the rest of his gang. In this movie, Jesse gets gunned down right after he vows to give up his bandit ways forever. In reality, the night before his death, Jesse James and the Ford brothers stole horses that Jesse planned to use the next day in a robbery of the Platte City bank. As preparation for most of his robberies, Jesse James stole horses from local farmers ... the same poor folk who (in the inaccurate legends) were supposedly the beneficiaries of his largesse. I cringed at one scene here, in which the fictional Jesse James is so gol-durn refined that he disapproves of an oil painting which tastefully depicts nudes. 'The True (not much!) Story of Jesse James' is wilfully dishonest about a thieving murderer, and likewise dishonest about the Civil War. For the very impressive stunt work, one good montage and a few fine acting turns, I'll rate this obscenely dishonest movie 2 points out of 10.","completion":"The correct sentiment for this text is: - negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Barely containing his disgust, Meyers' A Closer Look segment focused on the bullying, silencing and coercing those powerful men like Weinstein and Trump engage in as well as the \\"toxic culture of male entitlement.\\" The host first took on Trump, positing that \\"[we] have a president who built his political career almost entirely on bullying — his campaign and now his presidency has in many ways been a performance of dominance, a performance that in many cases has been explicitly misogynous,\\" he explained, citing the example of Trump's behavior towards the mayor of San Juan, Carmen Yulín Cruz, who Trump called \\"not a capable person.\\" \\"I'm sorry, she's not a capable person?\\" Meyers asks. \\"What did you do after the hurricane?\\" Meyers says of Trump. \\"You took a week to send FEMA, you reminded them about their debts, and then you showed up two weeks after that and shucked paper towels like a teenager at the break room at Costco.\\" Meyers then takes it one step further. \\"This is what male entitlement looks like,\\" he says. \\"A woman of color literally wading through floodwaters to help her constituents, being attacked by a powerful man so incompetent, he probably floods his own bathroom because he forgets to turn the faucet off.\\" Seguing into his take-down of Harvey Weinstein — who was ousted from The Weinstein Co. earlier this week after separate reports from The New York Times and The New Yorker broke, detailing claims of sexual harassment and rape against him, prompting several more women to come forward — Meyers said, \\"Donald Trump is perhaps the most famous example of this kind of abuse of male power, but he is by no means the only one.\\" Referring to Weinstein, Meyers continued, \\"This entire ordeal is yet another window into the entitled mind of powerful, predatory men who are used to operating without consequence. Weinstein thought he could escape the fallout of the allegations against him as he did for so many years, even though those accusations were horrifying.\\" Meyers also condemned Weinstein and his team's initial response to the allegations, in particular, former adviser Lisa Bloom's comments that Weinstein was just \\"an old dinosaur learning new ways.\\" \\"Dinosaurs don't learn new ways, they go extinct,\\" Meyers says to applause from the audience. \\"They didn't survive because they learned to type. If you're a dinosaur, then this is your Ice Age, buddy, and unlike real dinosaurs, no one is ever going to try and bring back Harvey Weinstein.\\" Watch the clip below. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Seth Meyers, a late-night show host, made a joke telling his audience that they need to choose between supporting him or President Trump because his show always makes fun of Trump.

She hits a bad bump driving home drunk on a dark road. Later, hearing noises in the garage, she finds a bleeding man, mangled and impaled on her jeep's bumper. Not calling 911, she tries to help, but he suddenly attacks. Panicked, she hits him with a golf club. After that, she buries his body in a shallow grave in the woods off Clover Rd. The next day, Mary covers up the crime (before parents return from a weekend trip); she scrubs off the blood but doesn't get the dent fixed (a suspicious cop at the auto shop scares her off, then she detours for her grandmas parrots at airport cargo). Mary starts coming apart. Irrational, she crashes on a tree to camouflage the small dent with a bigger dent. Later the news reveals the missing man is kindergarten teacher Timothy Emser (Kevin Corrigan), bipolar and unstable when he vanished. Strange things occur in Mary's house, making her feel toyed with by someone unseen; she descends into paranoia. It transpires that Rick (Christopher Shand), her boyfriend, gets involved in the cover up and goes to retrieve incriminatory evidence (a blanket) off the corpse, but is killed, replaced in Emser's grave. It becomes clear Emser survived. Unhinged, he returns to make Mary live through the same nightmare she inflicted on him. He stalks Mary many ways. The parrots squawk strange phrases, which alert Mary. At one point, she falls down the stairs, impaling a screw driver in her thigh. Emser surprise attacks, biting and stabbing her, and she passes out.

Surrounded by farmland, Wooster's planning commission chose to extend the community into these farm areas in the form of residential and commercial areas. Picture this--corn fields, old trees, clean air, country roads, and wildlife are all part of the area. Within four years, the people living on this farm step outside on their front porch to view an extensive shopping center containing Wal-Mart, McDonald's, Wendy's, TCBY, and a Cinemark movie theatre. The once quiet road is now a city street with traffic lights, busy with automobiles day and night. The air smells of car exhaust and fast food. Some destruction of farmland is unavoidable when a city expands. Instead of expanding outward, planning commissions should consider interior _ of a city. Tearing down unusable buildings could remodel many areas inside the city. In addition, commercialized buildings could extend upwards to avoid unnecessary use of land. Environmentally, commercial expansion is harmful to the land. Besides forms of pollution, wildlife, including both plants and animals, is put at risk.

The Martin County Sheriff's Office announced on social media that local deputies and the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force captured 24-year-old Bradley Andrew Kilpatrick Tuesday night about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of West Palm Beach, Florida. Kilpatrick was being held in the Walker County jail on marijuana and drug paraphernalia charges when he and 11 other prisoners fled Sunday night. Walker County Sheriff James Underwood says prisoners used peanut butter to change the numbers above a door and trick a new employee into opening another door that led outside. They then used their jail uniforms and blankets to climb over a razor wire topped fence. The other inmates were captured within 12-hours of the escape. ||||| The last remaining inmate of the 12 who escaped from Walker County Jail on Sunday has been captured at a home near West Palm Beach in Florida. The Walker County Sheriff's Office said Brady Andrew Kilpatrick, 24, was captured as of 6:28 p.m. on Tuesday. The Cordova man was in jail for possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia and second-degree possession of marijuana. The Martin County Sheriff's Office in Florida said on social media that a team of local deputies and agents with the FBI Violent Crimes Task Force flooded the neighborhood where Kilpatrick was trying to hide, which was located about 20 miles North of West Palm Beach. Kilpatrick told authorities who he was during his arrest, according to a video posted by the Martin County Sheriff's Office. Kilpatrick was one of the 12 inmates who used peanut butter to cover a door number and tricked a young jailer at 6:30 p.m. Sunday night, Sheriff James Underwood said. \\"Changing numbers on doors with peanut butter -- It may sound crazy, but these kinds of people are crazy like a fox.\\" Underwood said during a news conference on Monday. \\"He thought he was opening the cell door for this man to go in his cell, but in fact he opened up the outside door.\\" The inmates then climbed up a 12-foot fence. Some of them were cut by the razor wire, but none of them were seriously injured. All of them met at an undisclosed location after the escape. By Monday afternoon, 11 of the inmates were taken into custody thanks to the help of other inmates and multiple law enforcement agencies. The following six inmates were captured within 90 minutes of their escape when law enforcement went to the location where the inmates agreed to meet: John Richard Hunter, 26, Christopher Cole Spain, 18, Kristopher Keith Secrest, 20, Quadrekas Latoddrick Key, 21, Timothy Chaz Cooper, 28, and Steven Sanford Hartley, 27.

Înțelegerea și gestionarea situațiilor dificile este esențială pentru a menține pacea, armonia și bunăstarea în societate. Solidaritatea reprezintă empatia, compasiunea și ajutorul pe care îl oferim celorlalți în vremuri de dificultate. Fără solidaritate, putem permite ca frustrările și provocările să creeze diviziuni și să deterioreze conexiunile dintre oameni. Solidaritatea este importantă atât la nivel individual, cât și la nivel de comunitate sau național. La nivel individual, arătarea solidarității înseamnă să fim prezenți și să oferim sprijin emoțional și practic prietenilor și familiei noastre atunci când se confruntă cu situații dificile. La nivel de comunitate sau național, solidaritatea poate fi demonstrată prin acțiuni colective, cum ar fi protestele pașnice sau campaniile de strângere de fonduri, care susțin cauze și inițiative juste. De asemenea, este important să recunoaștem că solidaritatea nu este doar o reacție la dificultățile actuale, ci și o investiție într-un viitor mai bun pentru toți. Prin împărtășirea de resurse, de timp și de efort, lucrăm împreună pentru a construi o societate mai rezistentă și mai cooperantă, în care oamenii își pot rezolva diferendele în mod pașnic și just, fără a apela la violență sau la excluderea celorlalți. Solidaritatea ne permite să facem față unor probleme complexe și interconectate, cum ar fi inegalitatea economică, discriminarea sau schimbările climatice.

Everything changed when his family was brutally murdered by a notorious criminal, Vincent \\"The Viper\\" Valente, who was also the kingpin of an underground crime syndicate. Jack was devastated and devastated, but the justice system failed him, as The Viper had his web spread throughout the city, manipulating law enforcement and the judicial system. Swearing revenge against Valente, Jack decided to quit his job as a lawyer and take matters into his own hands. He hoped that one day, his dual life would collide, ultimately leading to Valente's downfall. Jack pursued his childhood dream of becoming a professional baseball player, joining the struggling team, the Springfield Sluggers. Bound by his love for his family, Jack worked tirelessly to balance his new life as a baseball player while secretly gathering intelligence on The Viper's illicit operations. His dedication started to pay off as he infiltrated the crime syndicate's ranks by sharpening his skills on and off the field, uncovering a vast network of corrupt officials and criminals. As Jack became a rising star in the baseball world, he used his newfound fame as a platform to expose Valente's corruption. He slowly gained allies in his fight for justice, including a rookie journalist named Sarah, determined to expose the truth behind the syndicate's influence on the city. As the baseball season progressed and Jack's popularity soared, so too did his proximity to the crime syndicate. The Springfield Sluggers made it to the championship game, drawing the attention of The Viper himself who planned to fix the game and profit from the gambling.

Question: You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Handle broke here too Product review: After a week, the spigot button on the handle fell apart and would no longer work. This teakettle is a piece of junk. Don't be fooled by a good price. Answer:","completion":"The review described would more than likely significantly decrease the chances of buying the product for multiple reasons. Firstly, the title itself hints at an issue with the product's handle, suggesting it's not an isolated case but a recurring problem as it says 'Handle broke here too'. This might make a potential customer think about product's quality control issues and the possibility that it is a design or manufacturing flaw that impacts many or all units of the product. Secondly, the main content of the review notes the issue of a main component of the product (the spigot button on the handle) falling apart after just a week of usage. This signifies poor durability and potentially poor materials used in production. The user calls the teakettle 'a piece of junk'. This characterization is strong negative language and it emphasizes their dissatisfaction with the product - length of usage versus the quick rate of depreciation. It also implies that the product failed to meet their expectations or the standards claimed by the manufacturer. Lastly, the review ends with a warning to other prospective buyers to not be 'fooled by a good price'. This suggests that while the product might be priced attractively or competitively, the reviewer believes that the value for money is not there due to the issues with quality and durability. All of these points contribute towards creating a sense of distrust in the product's quality and decrease the likelihood of purchasing it. It's important to take note that this is based on one review so it could be a single negative instance in a sea of positives.

Mycenaean Greece, a period between approximately 1600-1100 BC, represents one of the early stages of Greek civilization. This period laid the foundation for many aspects of Greek culture, including religion and mythology. The Mycenaean people were heavily influenced by the earlier Minoan civilization, but their religion was also shaped by Indo-European belief systems and those of the surrounding regions. The Mycenaean religion, like those of later Greek antiquity, was polytheistic, which means they worshipped multiple gods and goddesses. One notable surviving aspect of Mycenaean heritage is the names of these gods and goddesses, which were passed down and incorporated into later religious systems, particularly the Olympian Pantheon. The Olympian Pantheon refers to the classical collection of the twelve principal gods and goddesses of Greek mythology. These deities held central roles in Greek religious beliefs and were considered to reside on Mount Olympus, the highest peak in Greece. The Olympian Pantheon was an important part of Greek religion, culture and literature, and its influence can still be observed in art and architecture around the world. In the sentence provided, three major figures of the Olympian Pantheon are mentioned: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. Zeus was the king of the gods and the ruler of the sky. His brothers, Poseidon and Hades, governed the oceans and the underworld, respectively. These gods, among others, held significant roles in Greek religious practices and were believed to have the ability to influence the lives of ancient Greeks, thus demonstrating an ancestral tie. Other prominent figures from Mycenaean Greece who became part of the Olympian Pantheon include Hera, Athena, Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Demeter, Hermes, and Hestia. These gods and goddesses had various roles and responsibilities, and each one was associated with a unique set of customs, symbols, and rituals. In conclusion, the sentence provided gives a valid answer to the question about figures for the established religion that is based on ancestral ties. Mycenaean Greece's religious heritage has had a significant influence on later Greek mythology and the Olympian Pantheon, which played a crucial role in shaping Greek culture, traditions, and belief systems. Among the mentioned figures are Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, as well as many other gods and goddesses of divine lineage, emphasizing the ancestral connections and traditions that comprise the roots of Greek mythology."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This vibrant and auspicious colour holds deep cultural and historical significance within Chinese society and is believed to bring luck, joy, and prosperity to the couple's life. In Chinese culture, red not only represents love and fertility, but also wards off evil spirits, making it the ideal choice for celebrating such an important and meaningful occasion as a wedding. The history of red wedding dresses in China dates back to the earliest dynasties when the colour was associated with virtues of loyalty, honour, and righteousness. Over the years, as different empires ruled over China and transformed the country, the symbolism and importance of the colour red persisted, further embedding itself into the customs and practices of the Chinese people. During traditional Chinese weddings, brides usually wear a long-sleeved gown known as a qipao or cheongsam. This dress is made from silk and is intricately embroidered with various symbols and patterns, such as dragons, phoenixes, flowers, and other auspicious elements, typically in gold and silver thread. These designs represent the balance and harmony of the bride and groom's union, as well as their wishes for a happy and prosperous life together. The qipao is also typically adorned with beads, sequins, or pearls to amplify its elegance and formality. Traditionally, the bride's hair is also ornamented with a red headpiece or veil known as a xiape, which conceals her face until the groom lifts it during the wedding ceremony. This act symbolizes the beginning of their life together and the unveiling of their love, respect, and commitment to each other. It is also common for Chinese brides to wear multiple outfits during the day of the wedding. After wearing the red dress for the traditional wedding ceremony, some brides may change into a white Western wedding dress for the reception or more formal dinner. This change reflects the cultural shift due to globalization and often symbolizes a blending of the traditional Chinese and contemporary Western customs and values. Lastly, out of respect for their families, many Chinese couples pay homage to their ancestors by participating in a tea ceremony, during which they usually don traditional Chinese red wedding attire. The tea ceremony involves the couple serving tea to their parents, grandparents, and sometimes other relatives as a sign of gratitude for their guidance and support. In conclusion, the traditional colour of a wedding dress in China is red, symbolizing good fortune, love, and protection against evil. Today, the use of red wedding dresses remains a popular and meaningful custom for many Chinese brides, helping to maintain and preserve the rich cultural heritage and values of the Chinese community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What city contained the Antonia Fortress?, using the article: The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.

Fact 2: Botulism affects the nervous system. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"what does botulism affect?\\" with the following options: - humans - the skin - plants - our planet - neurons - people - insects - animals Answer:","completion":"Botulism affects neurons in the nervous system. Before providing a comprehensive answer, let us first delve deeper into both facts. Fact 1: Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. Neurons are specialized cells that transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. They form the fundamental building blocks of the nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Neurons communicate with each other through synapses, gaps between adjacent neurons where electrical or chemical signals are exchanged. These signals, otherwise known as nerve impulses, facilitate the regulation of various body functions such as muscle movement, digestion, and the processing of thoughts and memories. Fact 2: Botulism affects the nervous system. Botulism is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. These toxins are among the most powerful known to science and interfere with the normal functioning of the nervous system. Specifically, they block the release of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which is crucial for nerve impulse transmission at the neuromuscular junction. When the release of acetylcholine is hindered, it leads to muscle paralysis and, in severe cases, respiratory failure and death. Now, let us examine each of the given options to understand how botulism interacts with them: - Humans: Botulism affects humans by targeting their neurons, leading to potentially severe nervous system impairments. - The skin: Botulism does not directly affect the skin; its primary target is the nervous system, resulting in muscle paralysis and other complications. - Plants: Botulism does not affect plants as its toxins specifically target the nervous system, which plants lack. - Our planet: Botulism has no direct impact on the planet as a whole. However, it can pose a significant health threat to humans, resulting in localized or individual consequences. - Neurons: Botulism directly affects neurons by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a critical neurotransmitter necessary for nerve impulse transmission. - People: Similar to humans, botulism affects people by interfering with the functioning of their nervous systems. - Insects: Although botulism primarily affects humans and animals, insects can act as vectors in transmitting Clostridium botulinum spores and toxins to human food sources. - Animals: Some animals, such as birds and mammals, can also be affected by botulism. It primarily impacts their nervous systems, just as it does in humans. Given these details, we can conclude that botulism affects neurons, which are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. By targeting neurons and blocking neurotransmitter release, botulism causes potentially life-threatening impairments in the affected individual's nervous system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Information: - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds. - Thyme is an evergreen herb with culinary, medicinal, and ornamental uses. The most common variety is \\"Thymus vulgaris\\". Thyme is of the genus \\"Thymus\\" of the mint family (Lamiaceae), and a relative of the oregano genus \\"Origanum\\". - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands.

Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas. - Plectranthus edulis, the Ethiopian potato, known as \\"Welayta dinich\\" in Amharic, is a species of annual plant in the Lamiaceae family. It is indigenous to Ethiopia, where it is grown for its edible tubers. The tubers are cooked before they are eaten. - Salvia hispanica, commonly known as chia, is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae, native to central and southern Mexico and Guatemala. The sixteenth-century \\"Codex Mendoza\\" provides evidence that it was cultivated by the Aztec in pre-Columbian times and economic historians say it may have been as important as maize as a food crop. It was given as an annual tribute by the people to the rulers in 21 of the 38 Aztec provincial states. - Marjoram (\\"Origanum majorana\\", syn. \\"Majorana hortensis\\" Moench, \\"Majorana majorana\\" (L.) H. Karst) is a somewhat cold-sensitive perennial herb or undershrub with sweet pine and citrus flavors. In some Middle Eastern countries, marjoram is synonymous with oregano, and there the names sweet marjoram and knotted marjoram are used to distinguish it from other plants of the genus \\"Origanum\\". It is also called pot marjoram, although this name is also used for other cultivated species of \\"Origanum\\". - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

It is native to temperate western and southwestern Eurasia and the Mediterranean region. - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world. - The flowering plants (angiosperms), also known as Angiospermae or Magnoliophyta, are the most diverse group of land plants, with 416 families, approx. 13,164 known genera and a total of c. 295,383 known species. Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth.

Many of the plants are aromatic in all parts and include widely used culinary herbs, such as basil, mint, rosemary, sage, savory, marjoram, oregano, hyssop, thyme, lavender, and perilla. Some species are shrubs, trees (such as teak), or, rarely, vines. Many members of the family are widely cultivated, not only for their aromatic qualities but also their ease of cultivation, since they are readily propagated by stem cuttings. Besides those grown for their edible leaves, some are grown for decorative foliage, such as \\"Coleus\\". Others are grown for seed, such as \\"Salvia hispanica\\" (chia), or for their edible tubers, such as \\"Plectranthus edulis\\", \\"Plectranthus esculentus\\", \\"Plectranthus rotundifolius\\", and \\"Stachys affinis\\" (Chinese artichoke). - In general use, herbs are any plants used for food, flavoring, medicine, or fragrances for their savory or aromatic properties. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from spices. \\"Herbs\\" refer to the leafy green or flowering parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while \\"spices\\" are produced from other parts of the plant (usually dried), including seeds, berries, bark, roots and fruits. - Chesterfield Islands (\\"îles Chesterfield\\" in French) is a French archipelago of New Caledonia located in the Coral Sea, 550 km northwest of Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia.

The plant overall resembles the stinging nettle, though the leaves are somewhat rounder. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Polynesia ( from \\"poly\\" \\"many\\" + \\"nsos\\" \\"island\\") is a subregion of Oceania, made up of over 1,000 islands scattered over the central and southern Pacific Ocean.

It is indigenous to Africa, where it is grown for its edible tubers. It is more difficult to cultivate than \\"Plectranthus rotundifolius\\", but able to give greater yields. Although the crop is similar to a potato it is from the mint family but it is still quite nutritious and useful. This crop can benefit many subsistence farmers since it is native, easy to grow, growing popularity in the market and quite nutritious. - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs. - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\"). - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.

Information: - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - Irises is one of many paintings and prints of irises by the Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh . Irises was painted while Vincent van Gogh was living at the asylum at Saint Paul - de - Mausole in Saint - Rémy - de - Provence , France , in the last year before his death in 1890 . It was painted before his first attack at the asylum . There is a lack of the high tension which is seen in his later works . He called the painting \`\` the lightning conductor for my illness '' because he felt that he could keep himself from going insane by continuing to paint . The painting was influenced by Japanese ukiyo - e woodblock prints like many of his works and those by other artists of the time . The similarities occur with strong outlines , unusual angles , including close - up views , and also flattish local colour ( not modelled according to the fall of light ) . He considered this painting a study which is probably why there are no known drawings for it , although Theo , Van Gogh 's brother , thought better of it and quickly submitted it to the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants in September 1889 , together with Starry Night Over the Rhone .

'' - Oil painting is the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder. Commonly used drying oils include linseed oil, poppy seed oil, walnut oil, and safflower oil. The choice of oil imparts a range of properties to the oil paint, such as the amount of yellowing or drying time. Certain differences, depending on the oil, are also visible in the sheen of the paints. An artist might use several different oils in the same painting depending on specific pigments and effects desired. The paints themselves also develop a particular consistency depending on the medium. The oil may be boiled with a resin, such as pine resin or frankincense, to create a varnish prized for its body and gloss. What entity does 'irises ' has the relation 'material used' with?

Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Paragraph : If there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, more ultraviolet radiation will be trapped and the Earth will heat up. Question: Tony drives an SUV that contributes many greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Evan rides a scooter that contributes few greenhouses gases to the atmosphere. Who likely contributes less to the Earth heating up Tony or Evan? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Evan likely contributes less to the Earth heating up than Tony based on the information provided in the paragraph. This conclusion can be drawn from understanding the impact of greenhouse gases on the atmospheric temperature and comparing the emissions produced by an SUV and a scooter. The paragraph informs us that if there are more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, more ultraviolet radiation will be trapped, and the Earth will heat up as a result. Greenhouse gases are responsible for the greenhouse effect, which is a natural process that occurs when certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat, maintaining the Earth's average temperature. However, when the amounts of these gases increase, due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, the Earth's atmosphere captures more heat, resulting in global warming and climate change. Now, let's compare the vehicles driven by Tony and Evan. Tony drives an SUV, which is a large, fuel-consuming vehicle that emits more greenhouse gases when compared to smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. SUVs usually have larger engines and weigh more than smaller cars, leading them to consume more fuel and release increased greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, Evan rides a scooter, which generally produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions due to its small size, lighter weight, and more efficient use of fuel. In conclusion, Evan, who rides a scooter, likely contributes less to the Earth heating up compared to Tony, who drives an SUV. This is because Evan's vehicle emits fewer greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which corresponds to the reduced trapping of ultraviolet radiation and lesser heating of the Earth. By choosing a more environmentally friendly mode of transportation, Evan helps in reducing the overall impact of greenhouse gases and mitigates the effects of global warming and climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which group had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation? Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. A:","completion":"Group B, which presented somatic mutations, had fewer organisms having mutations that can be passed to the next generation. This is because somatic mutations occur in the body cells of an organism and are not inherited by offspring.

On the other hand, Group A presented germline mutations, which occur in the sex cells, or gametes, and can be inherited by the offspring as these mutations are present in the resulting organism's DNA. Since germline mutations can be passed down to offspring, they have a higher likelihood of affecting the next generation compared to somatic mutations, which remain limited to the individual organism."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Dylan is said to have premiered \\"Hard Rain\\" at the Gaslight Cafe, where Village performer Peter Blankfield recalled: \\"He put out these pieces of loose-leaf paper ripped out of a spiral notebook. And he starts singing ['Hard Rain'] ... He finished singing it, and no one could say anything. The length of it, the episodic sense of it. Every line kept building and bursting\\". Dylan performed \\"Hard Rain\\" days later at Carnegie Hall on September 22, 1962, as part of a concert organized by Pete Seeger. The song gained added resonance during the Cuban Missile Crisis, just one month after Dylan's first performance of \\"Hard Rain\\", when U.S. President John F. Kennedy gave his warning to the Soviet Union over their deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba, . Critics have interpreted the lyric 'hard rain' as a reference to nuclear fallout, but Dylan resisted the specificity of this interpretation. In a radio interview with Studs Terkel in 1963, Dylan said, \\"No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen … In the last verse, when I say, 'the pellets of poison are flooding the waters', that means all the lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers.\\" Many people were astonished by the power and complexity of this work. For Robert Shelton, who had given Dylan an important boost in his 1961 review in The New York Times, this song was \\"a landmark in topical, folk-based songwriting. Here blooms the promised fruit of the 1950s poetry-jazz fusion of Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, and Rexroth.\\" Folk singer Dave Van Ronk later commented: \\"I was acutely aware that it represented the beginning of an artistic revolution.\\" Pete Seeger expressed the opinion that this song would last longer than any other written by Dylan., what would be the answer ?

Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm. He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre. Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained. Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece. In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.

This relation is given by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, which states: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where F is the force of gravity, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the two objects. Given the information in the paragraph, we can compare the gravitational pull of Earth and Asteroid A on an object. Since Rob detected that all of the asteroids (including Asteroid A) have less mass than Earth, we know that the mass of Earth (m1) is greater than the mass of Asteroid A (m2). Additionally, Asteroid A is farther from Earth than Asteroid B, meaning the distance between Earth and Asteroid A (rA) is greater than the distance between Earth and Asteroid B (rB). Even though we do not have the exact values for the masses and distances, we can conclude that Earth has a stronger gravitational pull on an object than Asteroid A based on the given information. First, let's compare the mass factor in the gravitational force formula. Since Earth's mass is greater than Asteroid A's mass (m1 > m2), this factor for Earth's gravitational pull will be stronger than that of Asteroid A. Next, consider the distance factor. Because Asteroid A is farther from Earth, the force of gravity between an object and Asteroid A would decrease due to the increased distance (rA > rB). This factor further implies that Earth's gravitational pull would be stronger. Combining the mass and distance factors in Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, it becomes evident that Earth's gravitational pull is stronger than that of Asteroid A. Thus, if Rob needs to find the object with a stronger gravitational pull in classical theory, he should choose Earth over Asteroid A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? a). no. b). yes.","completion":"a). No. These two questions inquire about different information. The first question asks about the best dog restaurant in the world, which implies a dining establishment catered specifically to dogs and their owners. These restaurants typically serve dog-friendly dishes, providing a unique and enjoyable experience for dogs and their human companions. One of the best dog restaurants worldwide is \\"Bark'N Brunch Cafe\\" located in Long Island, New York. This restaurant is renowned for its menu designed explicitly for dogs, which includes dog-safe treats like pupcakes, barkin' bowls, and pupcorns, among other delicious edible items. Additionally, it offers a casual atmosphere where dog owners can enjoy their meal while spending quality time with their furry companions. On the other hand, the second question inquires about the best restaurants in the world, which refers to dining establishments that serve excellent food and provide exceptional service and ambience for human diners. These restaurants are often awarded for their culinary achievements, creativity, and consistency, and may cater to a broad range of tastes and cuisines. Various renowned institutions in the culinary world determine the best restaurants worldwide, including the World's 50 Best Restaurants, Michelin Guides, and the James Beard Foundation. These establishments create annual lists to showcase the top venues. A few examples of the best globally recognized restaurants include: 1. Mirazur: Located in Menton, France, and led by Chef Mauro Colagreco, Mirazur has won numerous prestigious culinary awards and accolades. Mirazur is celebrated for its dishes that convey Mediterranean flavors, using local ingredients and innovative culinary techniques. 2. Noma: Situated in Copenhagen, Denmark, and headed by Chef René Redzepi, Noma is known for its new Nordic cuisine and its emphasis on experimentation, foraging, and sustainable sourcing. The restaurant has been at the forefront of the world's gastronomic scene and has claimed the top spot on the World's 50 Best Restaurants list multiple times. 3. El Celler de Can Roca: This restaurant is located in Girona, Spain, and is run by the Roca Brothers. Known for its avant-garde menu, El Celler de Can Roca intertwines molecular gastronomy with traditional Spanish flavors while mixing in international culinary techniques. In short, both questions are distinct, with the first looking for the best restaurant that serves dogs specifically and the second looking for places that cater to the highest standards of food, service, and experience for human diners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: A Lexus ad in Car and Driver or Fortune is pretty well targeted at affluent people who like fancy cars. Here is a hypothesis: Some Lexus ads are targeted toward rich people who like nice cars. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the premise. The premise states that a Lexus ad in Car and Driver or Fortune (both magazines) is well targeted at affluent people who like fancy cars. This indicates that Lexus ads in these magazines are specifically aimed at wealthy individuals who appreciate luxury automobiles. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that some Lexus ads are targeted toward rich people who like nice cars. This implies there are certain Lexus ads that are created with the intention of appealing to a wealthy audience with a penchant for high-quality vehicles. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis. Both the premise and the hypothesis touch upon Lexus ads that aim to reach an affluent audience with a preference for fancy or nice cars. The main difference is the specificity of the audience (magazine readers in the premise, unspecified in the hypothesis) and the level of targeting (well-targeted in the premise, simply targeted in the hypothesis). Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true – that a Lexus ad in Car and Driver or Fortune is well targeted at affluent people who like fancy cars – this subset of Lexus ads does indeed cater to the wealthy demographic mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, in the case of these particular ads, the hypothesis is supported by the premise. Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The premise provides evidence that there are Lexus ads which target rich people who like nice cars, specifically in the magazines Car and Driver and Fortune. Since the hypothesis claims that some Lexus ads are indeed targeting this demographic, the truth of the premise supports the truth of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The rebels, he said, had reserves of 150 combat vehicles, including tanks. An earlier mistranslation of his words suggested Mr Zakharchenko had said the vehicles were on their way from Russia. Russia has denied claims by Ukraine and Western reporters that military aid to the rebels has been crossing the border. More than 2,000 civilians and combatants have been killed since mid-April, when Ukraine's new government sent troops to put down an uprising by pro-Russian separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. A huge humanitarian aid convoy from Russia is stalled on the Russian side of the border about two hours drive from Luhansk, apparently awaiting inspection by Ukrainian border guards. Red Cross official Pascal Cuttat said on Saturday there were still no security guarantees in place for his staff to escort the lorries, although \\"technical conditions\\" had been agreed with Ukraine and Russia for crossing the border. On Friday Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu assured his US counterpart Chuck Hagel that there were no Russian military personnel involved with the convoy, nor would it be used as a pretext for a Russian military intervention. Journalists who were invited to inspect some of the 280 or so vehicles on Friday found humanitarian aid inside but also noticed that some of the lorries were not full to capacity. Mr Zakharchenko, who became the prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) last week, made the announcement to the rebels' parliament on Friday, with a video of his speech (in Russian) posted on YouTube.

He added that \\"ethnic Ukrainian\\" volunteers from Russia, not servicemen, were fighting for the rebels, along with \\"Turks; a great many Serbs; Italians and Germans; and even two Romanians\\". Ukraine said on Friday it had partially destroyed an armoured column that had crossed from Russia on Thursday evening. Two UK newspaper reporters witnessed the alleged incursion.

A medal may be awarded to a person or organization as a form of recognition for sporting, military, scientific, academic, or various other achievements. Military awards and decorations are more precise terms for certain types of state decoration. Medals may also be created for sale to commemorate particular individuals or events, or as works of artistic expression in their own right. In the past, medals commissioned for an individual, typically with their portrait, were often used as a form of diplomatic or personal gift, with no sense of being an award for the conduct of the recipient. - A gold medal is a medal awarded for highest achievement in a non-military field. Its name derives from the use of at least a fraction of gold in form of plating or alloying in its manufacture. - Hancock is a city in Houghton County, Michigan, United States and is located on Copper Island, which is part of the Keweenaw Peninsula, on the Keewenaw Waterway directly opposite Houghton, Michigan.

Squaw Valley was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). It was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so from 1956 to 1960 the infrastructure and all of the venues were built at a cost of US80,000,000. It was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to walk to nearly all the venues. Squaw Valley hosted athletes from thirty nations who competed in four sports and twenty-seven events. Women's speed skating and biathlon made their Olympic debuts. The organizers decided the bobsled events did not warrant the cost to build a venue, so for the first and only time bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program. The Soviet Union dominated the medal count winning twenty-one medals, seven of which were gold. Soviet speed skaters Yevgeny Grishin and Lidiya Skoblikova won two gold medals each.

Russia responded by beginning to drive out Tajik guest workers, a move that threatens Tajikistan's entire economy. In total, some 700,000 Tajik citizens work in Russia. In the past quarter, they sent home some 742 million in remittances . Overall, the money guest workers send back makes up half of the republic's government budget. The Alauddin Valley is in the Fann Mountains in eastern Tajikistan. The place long held an attraction for Russian writers and adventurers. Later, during the Soviet era, it was a popular tourist destination. Yet establishing a strong relationship with the people of the mountainous region is not easy. Men are seldom seen in the area. Nearly every family has at least one breadwinner working in Russia, if not more. The farm work falls to the women, who divide it up among themselves. Each summer, the village chooses the most experienced and skilled women to take all of the cows (up to 300 of them) to the summer pastures high up on in the mountains. The women spend four months there with their children since there is no one to leave the children with. They milk the cows and prepare products for the winter: cheese, butter and so on. These fermented goods get them through the winter when snow and avalanches cut off all contact with civilization. Residents here generally have two questions for visiting Russians. The first one is obvious: Is President Dmitri Medvedev going to limit the entry of Tajik guest workers? The second question is less obvious: Are there cows in Moscow? The Alauddin Valley's women truly can't imagine life without either.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea? Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea. When the painting was put up for sale in 2012, the auction house catalogue stated that it...

Heat supplies the energy that causes motion. The deeper you go into toward the Earths core, the hotter it gets. At the core it is really hot. All that heat tries to rise toward the surface. In the Mantle, the rock is partially melted and is able to move. As it is heated, the material in the mantle moves toward the surface. As the mantle material rises, it cools. When it reaches the Earths crust, it is mostly stopped. A little of the material can break through the surface, but not all. Instead, it begins to move horizontally. The mantle material moves horizontally away from a mid-ocean ridge crest. Toward the surface, the mantle material starts to cool. As it cools it sinks back down into the mantle. These areas are where deep sea trench occur. The material sinks back down to the core. The system operates like a giant conveyor belt. The motion due to heating and cooling is called convection.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that has received six APRA Awards ? , can you please find it? In writing Young Modern, Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning \\"Straight Lines\\". Joannou believed that Young Modern was simpler than Diorama but \\"still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements\\". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.Gillies notes that Silverchair will often \\"run the risk of losing fans\\" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in Diorama and Young Modern. However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact \\"that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect\\" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band \\"appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got\\" in their careers. The band have received six APRA Awards with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the 2008 ceremony.

In 1878 a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States. He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk. In the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of Chinese railroad workers to find out his whereabouts.

Build a movie plot around this: What is being signified when the entire universe is shown glowing very brightly then disappearing? The end of the world A:","completion":"Title: The Last Radiance Genre: Sci-fi/Adventure/Drama Plot: In the near future, Earth receives an unprecedented cosmic signal termed \\"The Luminous Entity\\" that forecasts doom through an intense burst of light, resulting in the cosmic event of the universe glowing brightly before disappearing. This event would signify the end of not just Earth, but the entire universe. As panic and chaos engulf the world, space agencies, governments, and scientists from all countries are forced to collaborate in an effort to prevent this catastrophic event. Our protagonist, Dr. Ada Lovelace, a renowned astrophysicist, recognizes the signal as a potential message, not merely a threat. She embarks on a quest to decipher the meaning of this cryptic message, believing it to hold the key to the survival of the universe. As governments and private space programs from around the world race against time to evacuate segments of humanity to a new potential safe haven, a planet known as Kepler-452b, a distant world that remains unaffected by the Luminous Entity, Ada forms an eclectic team of experts comprising of an ex-military strategist, a genius hacker, and an archaeologist who specializes in ancient civilizations. Together, Ada's team uncovers surprising evidence that the Luminous Entity is a cosmic phenomenon that was previously encountered by an ancient civilization that seemingly vanished from Earth several millennia ago. The ancient civilization had left behind a complex network of hidden artifacts and structures around the world, encoded with secrets to help humanity communicate with the Luminous Entity in order to save the universe from a repetitive cycle of destruction and creation. As humanity scrambles to chart its way to the stars and find a new home in Kepler-452b, Ada's team must decipher the ancient codes, unravel the mysteries surrounding the Luminous Entity, and ultimately confront the colossal cosmic being to plead for the existence of the universe. The climax of the movie sees the deciphering of the final message, unlocking an interstellar portal that allows the team to travel to the center of the Luminous Entity. As the cosmic being absorbs the knowledge and emotions of the human representatives, it acknowledges their determination to protect the universe. Empathizing with the resilience of humanity and its sincere desire to grow and evolve, the Luminous Entity halts the process of destruction. In the final act, as society is left to face the impact caused by panic and chaos on Earth, humanity turns a new leaf, having learned the importance of unity, cooperation, and the pursuit of knowledge. With the cosmic balance restored and the universe saved from destruction, the memory of the Luminous Entity lives on as a reminder of the power of compassion, unity, and the human spirit. The Last Radiance is a compelling story that blends cosmic forces and human emotions to explore the limits of human potential, the importance of solidarity, and the undying essence of hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges"},{"prompt":"Given the question: What's the answer to that question: what has been discovered on mars so far?

Answer:","completion":"Fritz Lang and Christophe Gans are not from the same country. They are both filmmakers known for their work in the cinema industry, but they come from different European countries. Fritz Lang, born Friedrich Christian Anton Lang, was an Austrian-German filmmaker who was born on December 5, 1890, in Vienna, Austria. Lang is considered one of the pioneers of German Expressionist cinema and directed several influential films during the early 20th century, including the groundbreaking science fiction epic, \\"Metropolis\\" (1927) and the crime thriller, \\"M\\" (1931). Lang's career spanned both the silent and sound eras in film. He later moved to the United States to escape the Nazi regime and continued working in Hollywood, where he directed film noirs and crime dramas such as \\"Scarlet Street\\" (1945) and \\"The Big Heat\\" (1953). On the other hand, Christophe Gans is a French film director, producer, and screenwriter. Born on March 11, 1960, in Antibes, France, Gans is particularly known for his work in the horror and fantasy genres. He made his feature directorial debut with the film \\"Crying Freeman\\" (1995), based on a Japanese manga. Gans gained international recognition with his work on the movie \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\" (2001), a French historical action film with elements of horror and fantasy. He is also known for directing the film adaptation of the popular survival horror video game, \\"Silent Hill\\" (2006). While both filmmakers have had an impact on the cinema industry and the genres in which they've worked, they are from different countries and cultural backgrounds, with Lang hailing from Austria and Gans from France. Their filmmaking styles and subject matter are reflective of their individual experiences and artistic preferences, creating distinctly unique bodies of work within the world of cinema."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Dissapointed Product review: I had to return the item because it was defective and the replacement came with missing parts. I was given a mere partial refund but I will think it twice before ordering again through Amazon. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"This review undoubtedly depicts the product in an unflattering light. A thorough analysis of the review reveals several negative aspects mentioned by the reviewer that contribute to this unfavorable representation of the product. Here are some key points that elucidate the unflattering portrayal: 1. Defective item: The reviewer initially received a defective product, which already establishes a negative perception of the item. Consumers anticipate receiving a fully functional and high-quality product when making a purchase. However, in this case, the delivered item did not meet the buyer's expectations, leading to dissatisfaction and disappointment. 2. Replacement issues: While the reviewer attempted to resolve the problem by requesting a replacement, they unfortunately faced another problem as the replacement item arrived with missing parts. This further aggravates the dissatisfaction and implies that this might not be a one-off issue, but rather a consistent flaw in the manufacturing or quality control process of the product. 3. Partial refund: The reviewer's dissatisfaction is exacerbated by the fact that they were only granted a partial refund upon returning the defective item. Ideally, a full refund should be provided in such cases to compensate for the inconvenience caused to the customer. A partial refund may lead the reviewer to feel that they were not adequately compensated for their troubles and that their customer rights were not fully respected by the seller. 4. Caution with future purchases: The effect of these negative experiences has proven significant enough for the reviewer to reconsider purchasing through Amazon in the future. This statement denotes a loss of trust in the platform and serves as a warning to other potential buyers who come across this review. As a result, the review clearly paints the product in an unflattering light, highlighting the negative experiences of the reviewer. These experiences, which entail receiving a defective product, encountering difficulties with the replacement item, and being inadequately compensated, generate a sense of dissatisfaction and disappointment. Consequently, any potential buyers reading this review may be deterred from purchasing the product, given the unfavorable impression it receives through this evaluation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The political landscape in the United States looks a bit different in the wake of Tuesday's Senate election victory by Democrat Doug Jones in Alabama. In an outcome few could have imagined several weeks ago, Jones defeated controversial Republican candidate Roy Moore, who had the backing of President Donald Trump. In the wake of Jones' victory, Democrats are more confident about success in next year's congressional midterm elections, and Republicans are looking for a way to rebound. Late Tuesday, Jones paid tribute to the voters and staffers who supported him in his longshot victory over Moore. \\"This campaign has been about common courtesy and decency and making sure everyone in this state, regardless of which ZIP code you live in, is going to get a fair shake in life!\\" he told supporters. Moore was unable to overcome allegations of sexual misconduct stemming back decades involving several women who were teenagers at the time while Moore was in his 30s. Moore stopped short of conceding the race, however, saying, \\"We have been painted in an unfavorable and unfaithful light. We have been put in a hole, if you will, and it reminds me of a [Bible] passage in Psalms 40, 'I waited patiently for the Lord.' That is what we have got to do.\\" Moore had the full backing of the president in the final days of the campaign after Trump initially held back his endorsement in the wake of the allegations against Moore. The president responded Wednesday to questions at the White House about the Alabama race and said that he had hoped for a different result. \\"I wish we would have gotten the seat. A lot of Republicans feel differently. They are very happy with the way it turned out,\\" he said. \\"But as the leader of the party, I would have liked to have the seat. I want to endorse the people who are running.\\" Jones won in large part because of a strong Democratic turnout, especially by African-Americans. Moore was hurt by a depressed Republican turnout and a write-in campaign that drained away votes. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage. That was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage. \\"Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies,\\" said Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc., Silver Spring, Md. It \\"may well be\\" that theft of business data is \\"as serious a strategic threat to national security\\" as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms, said Michelle Van Cleave, the White House's assistant director for National Security Affairs. The conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association, a joint industry-government trade group. Any secret can be pirated, the experts said, if it is transmitted over the air. Even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder. They need only position themselves near a company's satellite dish and wait. \\"You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time,\\" Mr. Matchett said, adding : \\"It's a pretty good bet they won't get caught.\\" The only way to catch an electronic thief, he said, is to set him up with erroneous information. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Who does the government and private security experts say is committing electronic theft?\\" is \\"Mr. Matchett\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Who do the government and private security experts say is committing electronic theft?\\" is not \\"Mr. Matchett.\\" The paragraph states that foreign and industrial spies, as well as disgruntled employees, are the ones committing electronic theft. Noel D. Matchett, a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and the president of Information Security Inc., is one of the security experts discussing the issue and raising awareness about the problem, not committing the theft himself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This place was just too weird for my taste. When I go to a theater I go for the movie not for all the circus of it. I liked the decor. The staff and manager were super nice and friendly. But they were way over staffed. I'm sure in a few months time they will realize the overhead costs vs the revenue. I think the owner tried too hard. When you first walk in it feels like a hotel lobby/airport. They announce the movie times like when you board an airplane. They should have had staff dress like pilots and stewardess lol The food is minimum 10 and about 12 for a salad. It felt like \\"restaurant\\" prices without the restaurant taste. I ordered a piu00f1a colada and it was served in a martini glass. When they finally called our movie time. We were told how great the seating was. When I saw I wasn't impressed. In fact I was disappointed. I work at a desk 40hrs a week. The last thing I wanna do is feel like I'm sitting at a desk on a Saturday night. We opted for the VIP type seating instead of the \\"desk\\" style seating. The chairs at the VIP seating were too hard. It was uncomfortable. After two hours my butt was numb. Then the service! I like that they tried to make it easier by serving you at your seat during the movie but when you have a theater full, it gets distracting. You have a light behind and in front of you so you can see the menu the entire time of the movie. Then you have wait staff passing in front of you a minimum of 15x throughout the movie. It was distracting!!! We didn't watch a movie for kids, but the minute I walked in the theater I knew that any movie that played with kids involved would be a circus. Especially with the executive chairs that roll and the tray table they would play with that throughout the movie. Not a good idea. I went to enjoy the movie and I noticed on the car ride home we talked about the theater and not once about the movie. I give this place a max of 3 years before they close it's doors.

The Kinks were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1964 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most important and influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned \\"You Really Got Me\\", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States. The Kinks started out playing the then popular R&B and blues styles; then, under the influence of The Kingsmen's \\"Louie Louie\\" recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds -- due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as \\"the original punks\\". Dave Davies was \\"really bored with this guitar sound - or lack of an interesting sound\\" so he purchased \\"a little green amplifier ... an Elpico\\" from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and \\"twiddled around with it\\", including \\"taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my AC30\\" (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and \\"got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the cone [from the centre to the edge] ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played and I thought it was amazing.\\" The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into the Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings--most notably on \\"You Really Got Me\\" and \\"All Day and All of the Night\\". From 1966 onwards, The Kinks came to be known for their adherence to traditions of English music and culture, during a period when many other British bands dismissed their heritage in favour of American blues, R&B and pop styles. Ray Davies recalled that at a distinct moment in 1965 he decided to break away from the American scene, and write more introspective and intelligent songs. \\"I decided I was going to use words more, and say things. I wrote 'Well Respected Man'. That was the first real word-oriented song I wrote. ... [I also] abandoned any attempt to Americanise my accent.\\" The Kinks' allegiance to English styles was strengthened by the ban placed on them by the American Federation of Musicians. The ban cut them off from the American record buying public, the world's largest musical market, forcing them to focus on Britain and mainland Europe. The Kinks expanded on their English sound throughout the remainder of the 1960s, incorporating elements of music hall, folk, and baroque music through use of harpsichord, acoustic guitar, mellotron, and horns, and creating some of the most influential and important music of the period. Beginning with Everybody's In Show-biz (1972), Ray Davies began exploring theatrical concepts on the group's albums; these themes became manifest on the 1973 album Preservation Act 1 and continued through Schoolboys In Disgrace (1976). The Kinks found little success with these conceptual works, and reverted to a traditional rock format throughout the remainder of the 1970s. Sleepwalker (1977), which heralded their return to commercial success, featured a mainstream, relatively slick production style that would become their norm. The band returned to hard rock for Low Budget (1979), and continued to record within the genre throughout the remainder of their career.

Chapter X. -- FRIEDRICH DOES HIS MORAVIAN EXPEDITION WHICH PROVES A MERE MORAVIAN FORAY. While these Coronation splendors had been going on, Friedrich, in the Moravian regions, was making experiences of a rather painful kind; his Expedition prospering there far otherwise than he had expected. This winter Expedition to Mahren was one of the first Friedrich had ever undertaken on the Joint-stock Principle; and it proved of a kind rather to disgust him with that method in affairs of war. A deeply disappointing Expedition. The country hereabouts was in bad posture of defence; nothing between us and Vienna itself, in a manner. Rushing briskly forward, living on the country where needful, on that Iglau Magazine, on one's own Sechelles resources; rushing on, with the Saxons, with the French, emulous on the right hand and the left, a Captain like Friedrich might have gone far; Vienna itself--who knows!--not yet quite beyond the reach of him. Here was a way to check Khevenhuller in his Bavarian Operations, and whirl him back, double-quick, for another object nearer home!--But, alas, neither the Saxons nor the French would rush on, in the least emulous. The Saxons dragged heavily arear; the French Detachment (a poor 5,000 under Polastron, all that a captious Broglio could be persuaded to grant) would not rush at all, but paused on the very frontier of Moravia, Broglio so ordering, and there hung supine, or indeed went home. Friedrich remonstrated, argued, turned back to encourage; but it was in vain. The Saxon Bastard Princes \\"lived for days in any Schloss they found comfortable;\\" complaining always that there was no victual for their Troops; that the Prussians, always ahead, had eaten the country. No end to haggling; and, except on Friedrich's part, no hearty beginning to real business. \\"If you wish at all to be 'King of Moravia,' what is this!\\" thinks Friedrich justly. Broglio, too, was unmanageable,--piqued that Valori, not Broglio, had started the thing;--showed himself captious, dark, hysterically effervescent, now over-cautious, and again capable of rushing blindly headlong. 1. what kind of experiences is Friedrich having? 2. what did the princes complain about? 3. were they ahead or behindd the prussians? 4. what did the prussians do? 5. who else was hard to manage? 6. what was he mad about? 7. where did the French Detachment stop? 8. who was not interested in rushing? 9. what was one of the first Friedrich took under the Joint-stock Principle? 10. how did he feel about this?","completion":"1.

(CNN) -- Organizers of a tennis tournament in Dubai, criticized for banning an Israeli player, said Tuesday they were trying to protect the woman from anti-Israel protests. Shahar Peer told CNN she learned of her visa ban Saturday, just before her scheduled flight to Dubai. \\"The Tournament respects Ms. Shahar Peer as a professional tennis player on the Tour and understands her disappointment,\\" the organizers wrote in a statement. \\"Ms. Peer personally witnessed protests against her at another tournament in New Zealand only a few weeks ago. \\"We do not wish to politicize sports, but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here.\\" \\"I am confident that the OPTIONS: - CNN will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Dubai will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Israeli will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - New Zealand will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Peer will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Player will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Shahar Peer will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - Tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - UAE will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. - anti-Israel will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday.","completion":"\\"Tour will take appropriate actions to ensure that this injustice is not allowed to occur in the future, and that the Tour will make sure I will not be further harmed in the short and long term,\\" Peer said in a statement on Tuesday. This is the right answer because in this context, it makes the most sense for Shahar Peer, the Israeli tennis player, to express her confidence that the \\"Tour\\", or the tennis tour organizers, will make sure she isn't treated unfairly in future events. Other answers are wrong because it wouldn't make sense for Shahar Peer to say them. For example, \\"CNN\\" is a news channel and it doesn't control the events of the tournament or how the players are treated. Similarly, \\"Dubai\\", \\"Israeli\\", \\"New Zealand\\", \\"UAE\\", and \\"anti-Israel\\" are not responsible for making sure Shahar Peer is not subjected to unfair treatment in the future. It's not right for her to say \\"Peer will take appropriate actions\\" because she is Peer and she can't fix things alone. \\"Player\\" isn't the correct choice either because it refers to all players, not just one. \\"Shahar Peer\\" is not correct because it repeats the name unnecessarily in the sentence.

It portrays an emotional experience of an individual who has unintentionally lost something valuable to them - in this case, a voicemail that they wanted to keep. This tweet serves multiple purposes: it communicates the user's feelings and shares their experience so that others can empathize with their situation. 1. Regret: The tweet starts with \\"I just realized I deleted a voicemail,\\" which highlights the realization of an unintentional action. The individual indicates that the voicemail was something they truly wanted to hold onto, suggesting that they deeply regret their mistake and wish they could reverse the action. 2. Sadness: The tweet includes a direct expression of sadness—\\"Sadness...\\"—that functions as a reflection of their emotional state. This explicit statement of sadness illustrates a sense of vulnerability as they share their emotions with their followers on social media. 3. Disappointment: In conjunction with the other emotions, the sentiment of disappointment can be inferred as well. The user feels let down by the loss of the voicemail, as it was something they \\"really really wanted to keep.\\" This disappointment may not only be directed at themselves for accidentally deleting the voicemail but also at the situation that led to the loss in the first place. To sum up, the sentiment of this tweet covers a range of negative emotions—regret, sadness, and disappointment—elicited by the unintentional loss of a cherished voicemail.

Dodge is determined to save both his team and pro football in general when the players lose their sponsor and the league is on the brink of collapse. He convinces Princeton University's college football star, Carter \\"the Bullet\\" Rutherford, to join the Bulldogs, hoping to capitalize on Carter's fame as a decorated hero of the First World War (like Alvin York, he single-handedly captured a large group of German soldiers). In addition to his legendary tales of combat heroism, Carter has dashing good looks and unparalleled speed and skill on the field. As a result of his presence, both the Bulldogs and pro football in general begin to prosper. Chicago Tribune newspaper reporter Lexie Littleton becomes the object of the affections of both Dodge and Carter. Lexie has been assigned to find proof that Carter's war heroics are bogus. Carter confesses that the surrender of the Germans was a lucky accident and that his role in it was more foolish than heroic. Carter soon discovers Lexie's agenda and is doubly hurt when he learns that Dodge and Lexie are starting to show affections for each other and even shared a kiss. The ensuing fight over Lexie's affections puts her off. Spurred on by the threats of Carter's manager, she decides to publish the story. The story sparks a firestorm of accusations and reprimands. Carter's manager resorts to shady dealing to cover it up, even bribing the original witness to change his story. Dodge's attempts to legitimize pro football take a life of its own.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Ballantine Books is a major book publisher located in the United States, founded in 1952 by Ian Ballantine with his wife, Betty Ballantine. It was acquired by Random House in 1973, which in turn was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1998 and remains part of that company today. Ballantine's logo is a pair of mirrored letter Bs back to back. The firm's early editors were Stanley Kauffman and Bernard Shir-Cliff. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company). - The term \\"manga\\" (kanji: ; hiragana: ; katakana: or ) in Japan is a word used to refer to both comics and cartooning. \\"Manga\\" as a term used outside Japan refers to comics originally published in Japan. - Del Rey Manga was the manga-publishing imprint of Del Rey Books, a branch of Ballantine Books, which in turn is part of Random House, the publishing division of Bertelsmann. It was formed as part of a cross-publishing relationship with Japanese publisher Kodansha. Some of the Del Rey titles, such as \\"Tsubasa Chronicle\\" and \\"xxxHolic\\", are published in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi. Tricia Narwani, the editor of Del Rey, stated that \\"Del Rey finds most of its talent through conventions and existing professional contacts\\". - Lester del Rey (June 2, 1915 May 10, 1993) was an American science fiction author and editor. He was the author of many books in the juvenile Winston Science Fiction series, and the editor at Del Rey Books, the fantasy and science fiction imprint of Ballantine Books, along with his fourth wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. - The Silver Wolf is a novel by Alice Borchardt and published by Del Rey Books in 1993 . It is the first in the Silver Wolf Trilogy . - Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American author of gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She is perhaps best known for her popular and influential series of novels, \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\", revolving around the central character of Lestat. Books from \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" were the subject of two film adaptations, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" in 1994, and \\"Queen of the Damned\\" in 2002. - Lucasfilm Ltd. LLC is an American film and television production company based in the Letterman Digital Arts Center in San Francisco, California. The studio is best known for creating and producing the \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"Indiana Jones\\" franchises, as well as its leadership in developing special effects, sound and computer animation for film. Lucasfilm was founded by filmmaker George Lucas in 1971 in San Rafael, California; most of the company's operations were moved to San Francisco in 2005. The Walt Disney Company acquired Lucasfilm in 2012 at a valuation of 4.06 billion. - The Walt Disney Company, commonly known as Disney, is an American diversified multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California.

The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Random House is the largest general-interest paperback publisher in the world.

The friend had a habit of looking at everything positively that happened in his life and saying \\"This is good\\". One day the king and his friend were out hunting. The friend would prepare the guns for the king. The friend did something wrong in preparing one of the guns, and after the gun from his friend, the king fired it and his thumb was blown off. On seeing the situation the friend said as usual, \\"This is good!\\" The king replied, \\"No, this is not good!\\" He was very angry and sent his friend to jail . About a year later, the king was hunting in a forest. Cannibals caught him and took him to their village. As they were going to kill him, they noticed that the king was missing a thumb.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: At the end of the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia had broken apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by volcanic activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, the ocean floors rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, in the first half of the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.Early Paleozoic climates were warmer than today, but the end of the Ordovician saw a short ice age during which glaciers covered the south pole, where the huge continent Gondwana was situated. Traces of glaciation from this period are only found on former Gondwana. During the Late Ordovician ice age, a few mass extinctions took place, in which many brachiopods, trilobites, Bryozoa and corals disappeared. These marine species could probably not contend with the decreasing temperature of the sea water.The continents Laurentia and Baltica collided between 450 and 400 Ma, during the Caledonian Orogeny, to form Laurussia (also known as Euramerica). Traces of the mountain belt this collision caused can be found in Scandinavia, Scotland, and the northern Appalachians. In the Devonian period (416–359 Ma) Gondwana and Siberia began to move towards Laurussia. The collision of Siberia with Laurussia caused the Uralian Orogeny, the collision of Gondwana with Laurussia is called the Variscan or Hercynian Orogeny in Europe or the Alleghenian Orogeny in North America. The latter phase took place during the Carboniferous period (359–299 Ma) and resulted in the formation of the last supercontinent, Pangaea.By 180 Ma, Pangaea broke up into Laurasia and Gondwana. Now, I have a new situation: Two space explorers are flying around through an unknown galaxy when they discover two new planets. Given that these planets have no names, the explorers decide to name them after themselves. The planet of Sarahn is currently going through a large geographic shift. Many of the continents on the planet are currently breaking apart and moving. Timon, however, has been a stable planet with no continental moving for quite awhile now. Answer this question please: Which planet is currently making less oceanic crust? Answer:","completion":"Timon is currently making less oceanic crust, as it is a stable planet with no continental movement for quite some time. On the other hand, Planet Sarahn is going through a large geographic shift with continents breaking apart and moving, which would cause more oceanic crust to be formed due to volcanic activity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What film does Dickie audition for? Movie title: Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star Movie plot: Dickie Roberts is a former child star who shot to fame on a TV sitcom called The Glimmer Gang with his catchphrase \\"This is Nuckin' Futs!\\". His career subsequently halted after his 6th birthday. Since his heyday, he has been reduced to parking cars at Morton's and appearing on Celebrity Boxing, where he is matched with Emmanuel Lewis. In the public eye and to his girlfriend Cyndi who apparently leaves him during a roadside incident, Dickie is washed up. After talking to an old friend, Leif Garrett, Dickie is absolutely convinced that a new Rob Reiner movie in the works, Mr. Blake's Backyard, will be his comeback vehicle. Even after Sidney, his agent, does not land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he joy rides in a customer's vehicle, drops into an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, and he pesters Tom Arnold to hook him up with Reiner. After he is kicked out because he's not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being wasted and crashes what turns out to be a Lamaze class. However, Brendan Fraser (in an uncredited cameo appearance) is in the class and, finding his entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, he agrees to help him out and calls Reiner for Dickie. Reiner bluntly tells Dickie that the part is not within his abilities because it requires knowing how a regular person lives. Unfortunately, Dickie never had a real childhood; he grew up in the limelight, and then his mother abandoned him when his show was cancelled. Desperate to prove to Reiner that he's right for the part, Dickie sells his raunchy autobiography to raise 30,000. With the money, he pays a family to \\"adopt\\" him for a month, as he believes he will \\"watch and learn\\". Once Dickie hires his \\"family\\", things get off to a rocky start, as George, the bread winning father, insists that they need the money, despite the rightful reservations of the other family members.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those.

(IV) they are more likely to spend what they earn on their children. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Millions of families around the world have been given a helping hand out of poverty by micro-credits. These very small loans , usually less than US200, have enabled the very poorest people to set up or expand businesses and become self-sufficient. The micro-credit movement started with Professor Muhammad Yunus, who founded the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. Professor Yunus, who won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, used his own money to set up a bank to benefit the poorest people in Bangladesh--families living on less than US1 a day. There are now hundreds of organizations around the world following his blueprint to help people escape from poverty. So how does the system work? Local microfinance institutions (MFIs) make contact with families and offer loans, usually to women, to enable them to start or expand a business. These are very poor people who would not normally be able to get credit, but as no collateral is required they can get micro-credits. They pay back the loan on a weekly basis, over six months to a year. A very important aspect to the success of the micro-credit system is that receivers get local support. The MFIs educate local communities about ways to improve their lives, and offer practical support as well as collecting weekly loans payments. They encourage people to help each other, so that the whole community can pull itself out of poverty. MFIs may also help with literacy and health problems. Micro-credits are mainly given to women. Experience has shown that women are more motivated to improve their children's lives and will spend the money they make on better nutrition and schooling for their children. This may be the first chance they've had to contribute financially to the family, and their status in the home and the local community is raised. The micro-credit system is not charity. The payments are fixed-term loans and interest is charged. The costs of making such small loans, collecting them and giving personal support are high. This is shown in the interest rates, which range from 15... Question: Bank loans are mainly made to women because _ .

The sailors race around New York attempting to find her in the brief period they have. They are assisted by, and become romantically involved with, two women, and pair up: Ozzie with Claire, an anthropologist; and Chip with Hildy Esterhazy, an aggressively amorous taxi driver.

I would give it a 3-star rating out of 5 for its overall performance and functionality. On a positive note, the app does fulfill its main purpose of providing users control over their device's superuser permissions. As a tech-savvy person, I appreciate having the ability to manage these permissions to ensure that only authorized apps get access to such crucial system controls. The interface is also user-friendly, and the app is relatively easy to set up and use. However, there are a few areas that could use improvement. Firstly, the app tends to be a bit unstable at times, crashing or freezing more often than I would like. While this issue is not persistent, it can be quite frustrating when it occurs. The updates for the app are few and far between, and I feel this could be a significant factor behind its stability issues. More frequent updates would address these concerns by incorporating bug fixes and the latest security patches. Finally, I believe the app could benefit from expanded compatibility with more devices and custom ROMs. While it works well on some of my gadgets, it has not been fully compatible with others, requiring me to search for alternative solutions in those cases. In conclusion, the com.koushikdutta.superuser app offers a satisfactory solution for users looking to manage superuser permissions on their devices. There's significant potential for improvement, and I am hopeful that future updates will address the issues of instability, device/Rom compatibility, and more frequent software updates."},{"prompt":"Question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: A lethal disappointment Review: This compilation of songs from the lethal weapon movies would be better if they were the ones from the original recording artist as heard in the movies.

In honor of this special day, which makes otherwise rational people do ridiculous things to get their name in the (kinda) history books, we’ve rounded up some of the weirdest records out there. Find out what they are after the jump. The first honor goes to former Texas Medical student Wesley Pemberton who had the world’s longest leg hair, which had grown to 5 inches long. After Pemberton realized it wasn’t a girl’s hair that had landed on his leg, he started conditioning the stuff to make sure it stayed nice. Dealbreaker? [KLTV] An English man named Ken Edwards ate 36 cockroaches in one minute on the appropriately named British morning show “The Big Breakfast.” He said that swallowing the critters is “like having an anesthetic at the back of the throat,” because of the scent they emit to ward off predators. Apparently, Ken got attention several years ago after putting 47 rats down his pants. [Guinness World Records] The record for the longest fingernails belonged to a woman named Lee Redmond, who managed to avoid cutting her nails since 1979 and they’d grown to a combined 28 ft., 4.5 inches. But when they broke off in a car crash, the 68-year-old realized it was way easier to do things without them and decided it was a sign to “move on.” The record was passed on to Melvin Booth whose nails were 29 ft., 8.3 inches. [The Wondrous, Telegraph] Last year, a man named Chayne Hultgren, but who calls himself The Space Cowboy, pulled 907 pounds using his eye sockets in Milan. How someone figures out they’re really good at pulling heavy things with their eye sockets we may never know. Apparently, when you put Mentos into a bottle of Coca Cola, it erupts. This is important to know if you intend to break the world record for most simultaneous Mentos-fueled Diet Coke explosions ever! This August, Mexico City broke China’s world record with 2,433 participants. (China’s record in June had 2,175 enthusiasts.) [World Record News] In 2008, 1,253 people dressed like Smurfs and gathered at the Muckno Mania Festival in Ireland. Naturally, they won the record for largest gathering of people dressed as Smurfs. It’s kind of shocking what some people will do to get in the book, but it’s also kind of impressive how people can come together for a common purpose. It’s too bad most of the common purposes don’t actually help anyone, but I guess fun is important and someone has to take care of the blue paint industry. [The Wondrous] I suppose the Guinness people thought it would be super cute for the world’s leggiest woman to pose with the world’s smallest man, but The Daily Mail said the little guy “caught a sneaky peek.” Svetlana Pankratova isn’t the world’s tallest woman (she’s 6’ 7” while the tallest woman is 7’ 9”), but her legs are 4’ 4” tall! The leggy Russian says dating has been challenging and said, “some [men] don’t like standing next to a woman that tall.” [Daily Mail] Charlie Bell decided he wanted to break a world record and got his chance on national TV after agreeing to move a crap-ton of maggots from one container to another ... using his mouth. If you’ve got a weak stomach, you may have to stop reading, but just know Charlie won after moving 17 kilos (37.4 lbs) of the squirmy guys. And no one ever made out with him ever again. Probably. Bernie Barker retired from his energy job and took up a career stripping ... when he was 60 years old. Barker wanted to get back in shape after recovering from prostate cancer and the career move also earned him the title of oldest male stripper. [Guinness World Records] There was an epic battle over who got the most piercings in one sitting, between a guy named Robison in Marseilles and a British dude named Kam Ma. Apparently, Robison was out to beat Kam Ma’s 2002 record of 600 piercings, by getting 1,000 piercings. But Kam Ma caught wind of Robison’s plan and broke his own record with 1,015 piercings, then Robison increased his plan for 1,200 but ended up getting 1,016 piercings cause he hadn’t thought about how crappy getting stuck with needles will feel after a few hours. After setting the record, he took out all of them except for the record-breaking one. [Oddee] ||||| Most visitors to Antarctica go to see the penguins and the glaciers. Ashrita Furman went to hop on a pogo stick. Mr. Furman, seeking to break the Guinness World Record for the fastest mile on a pogo stick, jumped up and down a landing strip on the Antarctic tundra in 2003. Ashrita Furman \\"The conditions were pretty hard,\\" says the 56-year-old New Yorker, noting that extreme temperatures caused his pogo stick to freeze up midway through the event. He nevertheless completed the feat in 17 minutes, 45 seconds, setting the world record. It was just another day in the life of Mr. Furman, who holds the ultimate Guinness world record: The record for Guinness world records. Since 1979—when he set his first record by completing 27,000 jumping jacks—Mr. Furman has set 312 Guinness records, more than anyone else. He currently holds 120 titles. Watch clips from some of Guinness World Record-Record Holder Ashrita Furman's Events. Thursday, Guinness is holding its annual Guinness World Records Day and has flown Mr. Furman to London to participate. The company expects more than 300,000 people world-wide to compete in activities ranging from the largest gathering of people dressed as characters from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" to the heaviest road vehicle pulled by human teeth. Mr. Furman's mission: break the record for walking with the heaviest shoes. He's hoping to add enough weight to a pair of custom-made metal boots so that each foot will weigh about 160 pounds. \\"He's living and breathing what Guinness is all about,\\" says Alistair Richards, Managing Director of Guinness World Records. \\"He lives by a philosophy that nothing is impossible.\\" Mr. Furman has been defying the impossible for more than 30 years. In 1981, he clapped his hands for 50 hours straight—loud enough so that the sound could be heard 120 yards away—at a pond near his home in Queens, New York. \\"The hardest part was staying up,\\" he says. In 1986, he somersaulted continuously more than 12 miles through Massachusetts, along the route followed by Paul Revere on his famous midnight ride. After eating four slices of pizza the night before, Mr. Furman became ill during the somersaults. \\"I was exhausted, nauseous, and my abdomen cramped with each roll,\\" he says. But he made it. In 2005, he broke the record for spinning the largest hula hoop—14 feet 6 inches—at least three revolutions. The following year, he, along with some friends, built the largest popcorn structure—20 feet 10 inches—in the shape of a multitiered cake. One of his oddest endeavors involved cutting the most apples in midair with a samurai sword—27 apples in one minute. \\"It took a year of practice and I stabbed myself often,\\" he says. Guinness says it receives about 1,000 applications a week for new record categories. About 80% are rejected. It currently has about 40,000 categories. \\"We are very, very broad,\\" says Guinness's Mr. Richards. \\"As long as it's measurable, as long as you can quantify that measurement, as long as it can be broken, as long as we think it's interesting, it stands a chance.\\" Enlarge Image Close Jowan Gauthier Mr. Furman's feats include covering the most distance on a pogo stick while juggling three balls in Easter Island. Unlike many reigning champs, who secure endorsements, Mr. Furman doesn't profit from his victories, and he's happy to share the secrets of his success. He has turned down endorsements and instead manages a health food store in Queens, not far from where he grew up. He gets a little financial help from his father—a retired lawyer and executive. Mr. Furman says he fell in love with the Guinness World Records Book when he was 10. \\"I remember carrying it around and reading it under the covers at night,\\" he says. Since he wasn't athletic as a child, he figured he could never break a Guinness record. His father, Bernie Furman, says there was little sign that the younger Mr. Furman would become a world class competitor. He cut gym so often that his mother had to plead with an assistant principal to let him graduate on time from Jamaica High School and attend Columbia University. After two years, he dropped out of college to study meditation with an Indian-born spiritual teacher, Sri Chinmoy. Around this time, Mr. Furman, whose birth name was Keith, changed his name to Ashrita, which means \\"protected by God\\" in Sanskrit. He says the meditation he learned from Mr. Chinmoy allows him to perform beyond his expectations. In 1978, Mr. Chinmoy convinced Mr. Furman to train for a long distance road bike marathon. After surprising himself by coming in third, Mr. Furman set his sights on Guinness records. Mr. Furman, who is single, gets most of his ideas from studying existing records and deciding if he can break them. He tries to pick records that work different areas of the body, he says, so he can have a \\"well rounded\\" training schedule. Enlarge Image Close Prabhakar Street Mr. Furman's feats also include sack racing a yak in Mongolia. \\"I would find myself in places, and I would see an opportunity,\\" he says. While on a trip to Mongolia in 2007, he decided to do a competition there. After seeing yaks, he attempted a one-mile sack race against a yak—clocking in at 16 minutes, 41 seconds, breaking the existing sack race record. He notes that many of his records don't require much athletic ability. They include egg cracking with one hand, lemon peeling and duct taping oneself to a wall. But winning can take years. It also requires discipline, creativity and friends willing to toss, measure and build. It's not unusual for Mr. Furman to brainstorm with friends when he's trying to win a record. Homagni Baptista, a friend from his meditation group, experimented for weeks with different recipes when Mr. Furman was trying to build the world's largest lollipop. No ordinary sucker, the raspberry lollipop was made after the men spent a few days building a mold in the back of a flat bed truck and another four days boiling sugar. In the end, it weighed about 6,500 pounds. Almost weekly, someone in the world is breaking one of his records. His response: Work to retake it and come up with more competitions. \\"I want to inspire people,\\" says Mr. Furman, who is almost always training for three or four events. \\"If you have a dream, you can achieve your dream. I'm living my dream.\\" Write to Jilian Mincer at jilian.mincer@dowjones.com ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Guinness World Record Day celebrates the weird and wonderful achievements of individuals worldwide, showcasing the incredible feats they perform to make it into the history books.

Article: When you tidy your messy bedroom, it gets a lot easier to find things. Dreams may work the same way for a messy brain, helping you learn by organizing memories and ideas. To test how much dreams can help learning, Robert Stickgold had some students play a shape-fitting game called Tetris for a few hours and then go to sleep. Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes. Interestingly, the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most. Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills. As we dream, many important tasks are getting done. The brain decides what to keep and what to forget. It is connecting new experiences to older learning. In fact, the brain is learning all night long. Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions . At night, emotions are in the driver's seat. People who have had an upsetting experience often dream about it afterward. Often the dream event changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset. So if your best friend moves away, you might dream that you're the one who's moving. In fact, dreams have a proven power to improve mood, and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't. Everybody dreams for a couple of hours every night--in the course of your life, you'll spend about 25 years asleep and 6 years dreaming. There's probably no single answer to the question why we dream, but there doesn't have to be. One dream might help you remember your math facts, while another might lead to a new invention, or give you a fun, crazy story to tell your friends.

In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties.

Q:Given the below context: By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs. His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days.

The equation has two terms with the variable n, namely -26n and 119n. We can combine them as follows: (-26n + 119n) + 1395 = 0 93n + 1395 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable. To isolate n, we want to get rid of the 1395 term on the left side and have n alone. We can do that by subtracting 1395 from both sides of the equation: 93n + 1395 - 1395 = 0 - 1395 93n = -1395 Step 3: Solve for n. Now, we can find the value of n by dividing both sides of the equation by 93: 93n / 93 = -1395 / 93 n = -15 So, the solution to the equation -26n + 119n + 1395 = 0 is n = -15."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The Reichswehr (English: Imperial Defence) formed the military organisation of Germany from 1919 until 1935, when it was united with the new \\"Wehrmacht\\" (Defence Force). - The Jagdpanther (German: \\"hunting panther\\") was a tank destroyer built by Nazi Germany during World War II based on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The \\"Jagdpanther\\" combined the very powerful 8.8 cm KwK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of German ordnance production, maintenance and training in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew readiness. - The Pak 43 ( Panzerabwehrkanone 43 ) was a German 88 mm anti-tank gun developed by Krupp in competition with the Rheinmetall 8.8 cm Flak 41 anti-aircraft gun and used during the Second World War . The Pak 43 was the most powerful anti-tank gun of the Wehrmacht to see service in significant numbers , also serving in modified form as the 8.8 cm KwK 43 main gun on the Tiger II tank , to the open - top Nashorn , and fully enclosed , casemate - hulled Elefant and Jagdpanther tank destroyers . The improved 8.8 cm gun had a very flat trajectory out to 914 m ( 1,000 yd ) , making it easier for the gunner to hit targets at longer ranges as fewer corrections in elevation were needed . In addition to this , the gun 's exceptional penetration performance made it able to frontally penetrate any Allied tank to see service during the war at long ranges , even the Soviet IS - 2 tanks and IS chassis - based tank destroyers . The gun 's maximum firing range exceeded 13 kilometers ( 8 miles ) . - The 8.8 cm KwK 43 L/71 (Kampfwagenkanone \\"fighting vehicle cannon\\") was an 88 mm 71 calibre tank gun designed by Krupp and used by the German Wehrmacht during the Second World War. It was mounted as the primary armament on the Panzerkampfwagen VI Ausf. B \\"Tiger II\\" and the 8.8 cm PaK 43, an anti-tank gun, was very similar in design and use albeit not mounted on tanks but rather on tank destroyers or deployed on the field. - Düsseldorf (Low Franconian, Ripuarian: \\"Düsseldörp\\" ) is the capital city of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the seventh most populous city in Germany. Düsseldorf is an international business and financial centre, renowned for its fashion and trade fairs. The city is headquarters to one Fortune Global 500 and two DAX companies. Messe Düsseldorf organises nearly one fifth of premier trade shows. - Nashorn (German \\"rhinoceros\\", pronounced [nashn]), initially known as Hornisse (German \\"hornet\\"), was a German tank destroyer of World War II. It was developed as an interim solution in 1942 by equipping a light turretless chassis with the Pak 43 heavy anti-tank gun. Though only lightly armoured and displaying a high profile, it could frontally penetrate any Allied tank at long range, and its relatively low cost and superior mobility to heavier vehicles ensured it remained in production until the war's end. - Hornets (insects in the genera Vespa and Provespa) are the largest of the eusocial wasps, and are similar in appearance to their close relatives yellow jackets. Some species can reach up to in length. They are distinguished from other vespine wasps by the relatively large top margin of the head and by the rounded segment of the abdomen just behind the waist. Worldwide, there are 22 recognized species of \\"Vespa\\", and three species of \\"Provespa\\", which are unique amongst hornets in being nocturnal. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the European hornet (\\"Vespa crabro\\"), is widely distributed throughout Europe, Russia, North America and Northeast Asia. Wasps native to North America in the genus \\"Dolichovespula\\" are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g. baldfaced hornets), but are actually yellowjackets. - Essen (Latin: \\"Assindia\\") is a city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Its population of approximately 589,000 makes it the ninth-largest city in Germany. It is the central city of the northern (Ruhr) part of the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area and seat to several of the region's authorities. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Kriegsmarine (\\"War Navy\\") was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It superseded the \\"Kaiserliche Marine\\" (German Imperial Navy) of World War I and the inter-war \\"Reichsmarine\\".

It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - The Treaty of Versailles was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919. - Rheinmetall AG is an automotive parts supplier and military technology group headquartered in Düsseldorf. In fiscal 2015 (2014), the company's 20,676 (20,166) employees generated sales of €5.18 billion (€4.68 billion). Rheinmetall was the tenth-largest European defence contractor in 2011. - U-boat is the anglicised version of the German word U-Boot , a shortening of Unterseeboot, literally \\"undersea boat\\". While the German term refers to any submarine, the English one (in common with several other languages) refers specifically to military submarines operated by Germany, particularly in the First and Second World Wars. Although at times they were efficient fleet weapons against enemy naval warships, they were most effectively used in an economic warfare role (commerce raiding), enforcing a naval blockade against enemy shipping. The primary targets of the U-boat campaigns in both wars were the merchant convoys bringing supplies from Canada, the British Empire, and the United States to the United Kingdom and (during the Second World War) to the Soviet Union and the Allied territories in the Mediterranean. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The Elefant (German for \\"elephant\\") was a heavy tank destroyer used by German Wehrmacht Panzerjäger during World War II. It was built in small numbers in 1943 under the name Ferdinand after its designer Ferdinand Porsche, using tank hulls that had been produced for the Tiger I tank requirement which was rejected in favour of a Henschel design. - Ferdinand Porsche (3 September 1875 30 January 1951) was an automotive engineer and founder of the Porsche car company. He is best known for creating the first gasoline-electric hybrid vehicle (Lohner-Porsche), the Volkswagen Beetle, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, several other important developments and Porsche automobiles. In addition, Porsche designed the 1923 Benz Tropfenwagen, which was the first racing car with a mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. - The Krupp family (see pronunciation), a prominent 400-year-old German dynasty from Essen, have become famous for their production of steel, artillery, ammunition, and other armaments. The family business, known as Friedrich Krupp AG, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. It was important to weapons development and production in both world wars. One of the most powerful dynasties in European history, for 400 years Krupp flourished as the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany. From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities. - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.

The Rathers moved to Houston, where Dan attended Love Elementary School and Hamilton Middle School. He graduated in 1950 from John H. Reagan High School in Houston. In 1953, he earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Sam Houston State University where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Houstonian. On September 8, 2004, Rather reported on 60 Minutes Wednesday that a series of memos critical of President George W. Bush's Texas Air National Guard service record had been discovered in the personal files of Lt. Bush's former commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jerry B. Killian. Once copies of the documents were made available on the Internet, their authenticity was quickly called into question. Much of this was based on the fact that the documents were proportionally printed and displayed using other modern typographic conventions usually unavailable on military typewriters of the 1970s. The font used on the documents has characteristics that exactly match standard font features of Microsoft Word. This led to claims that the memos were forgeries. The accusations then spread over the following days into mainstream media outlets including The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times. Rather and CBS initially defended the story, insisting that the documents had been authenticated by experts. CBS was contradicted by some of the experts it originally cited, and later reported that its source for the documents - former Texas Army National Guard officer Lt. Col. Bill Burkett - had misled the network about how he had obtained them. On September 20, CBS retracted the story. Rather stated, \\"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have gone ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question.\\" The controversy has been referred to by some as \\"Memogate\\" and \\"Rathergate.\\" Following an investigation commissioned by CBS, CBS fired story producer Mary Mapes and asked three other producers connected with the story to resign.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the New York City borough of The Bronx. After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1917â1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) proves elusive in this regard, but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board. After attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease, Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results: Leonard completely \\"awakens\\" from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and experience \\"awakenings\\" back to reality. Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula (Penelope Ann Miller), the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated, a number of facial and body tics are starting to manifest, which Leonard has difficulty controlling. While Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary measure. As the first to \\"awaken\\", Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of \\"awakening\\". Leonard's tics grow more and more prominent and he...

During these twenty-eight years wars and revolutions had come and gone in Europe. Her uncle, Stanley Baldwin, had led his country for some time. Technical developments had changed the conditions of everyday life almost beyond recognitions, but all these events had left as a matter of fact untouched the small religious community to which she had belonged. In 1949 Miss Baldwin published her impressions of those bewildering years of her return to a world in which the motorcar had replaced the horse and carriage and where respectable women showed their legs and painted their faces. Yet it was not only these odd sights that surprised her, for she was more puzzled by what she heard. During a railway journey the term \\"luggage in advance\\" meant nothing to her, so in desperation she asked the porter to do as he thought best. Reading the newspapers made her feel very stupid, because the writers of reviews and leading articles used words and phrases such as Jazz,prefix = st1 /Hollywood, Cocktail and Isolationism. These and many others were quite incomprehensible to Miss Baldwin, who was really bewildered when friends said: \\"It's your funeral or Believe it or not.\\" This is a rare and valuable reminder to the rest of us that the English language does not stand still. All language changes over a period of time for reasons which are imperfectly understood. Or rather since speech is really a form of human activity, it is more exact to say that each successive generation behaves linguistically in a slightly different manner from its predecessors(,). In his teens the young man likes to show how up-to-date he is by the use of the latest slang , but as the years go by some of his slang becomes standard usage and in any case he slowly grows less receptive to linguistic novelties(,),so that by the time he reaches his forties he will...

Here is an email: Herewith a few ideas for the October meeting in London, some of them after checking with Paul Portney and with Pankaj. I offer these very, very preliminary thoughts just to start you thinking - do you want your UK colleagues on the program; do we want some ancillary events? After getting your views on questions such as these, I can make more definite suggestions. I certainly think that we should convene a few hours before the opening dinner so that the advisors can have a tour of the building and the facilities. Also, I am hoping that Steve will leave some time on this trip for a tour of the new BA headquarters - very innovative. We should consider doing something on the global warming question from the viewpoint of the Europeans. Start with three recommendations on the political side that Paul received from David Victor of the Council on Foreign Relations (characterized as \\"a VERY smart guy on climate\\"): Tony Brenton (Deputy chief of mission, UK embassy in DC. Has been on UK climate delegations for a decade; smart and lively; pragmatic; insightful). Bo Kjellen (Swedish head of delegation; knows European politics inside out; big figure in Europe). Tubiana, Laurence (Conseil d'Analyse Economique, France; knows the issue and can speak to French position, but may not have the gravitas of Kjellen or Brenton). Among other ideas (I have winnowed out several) is a guy named Liam Salter at Climate Network Europe. Brussels based, but relatively junior. Paul also recommends a woman by the name of Laurence Tubiana, an economist in the French government's equivalent of the CEA; she has a reputation as a good presenter and a good economist. WOULD YOU PLEASE CHECK THESE FOLKS OUT WITH YOUR LONDON PEOPLE, AND GET ADDITIONAL NAMES FROM THEM. THE GOAL IS TO GIVE ALL OF US A PERSPECTIVE ON THE EUROPEAN VIEW ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - UNLESS YOU THINK THAT NOT A USEFUL TOPIC. I turn now to Pankaj's suggestion, which I transmit verbatim: \\"I remember promising to scout around and see if there were a European whom it would be interesting to invite to talk to the Enron International Advisory Council about the (non) convergence of governance structures in Europe, particularly on the Continent, to the U.S. model. I got the following names from Jay Lorsch (apparently all members of the committee steering a multifaculty Harvard business School project on governance in comparative perspective) as possibilities. Jay suggested that Sihler would be best (former CEO of Henkel, very senior), Peter's second best (apparently, chairman of Amsterdam Stock Exchange now) and Smith - formerly Managing partner at Price Waterhouse Coopers - would be the most junior of the three. I don't personally know any of the three.\\" Now some ideas of my own, again acting on the assumption that we want a two-way educational dialogue - to give your folks in London and Europe a run-down on the situation in the US, and the US contingent a better understanding of how European policymakers view the issues we all face. 1.Bill Kristol on the US political scene, in which there is great interest here, and great misunderstanding of the Bush administration. We might also consider inviting Larry Lindsey or some other Bush person if allowed to do so. 2. Someone on the European view on global warming (see suggestions above). 3. Energy regulation in the UK. Callum McCarthy. 4. Economic outlook. Gavyn Davies (usual talk). 5. What went wrong in California (great interest in that over here) and how to fix it. Steve could do this, or you could invite Bill Hogan (just joking) or the chairman of FERC if we are allowed to pay his way. 6. Motivating people in a multinational, multicultural organization. If this is of interest, I can get recommendations for speakers. 7. I would be inclined to add a high-level speaker on the state of US-UK-European relations, perhaps as a dinner speaker. Between Gavyn and me, we might be able to get Chancellor Gordon Brown, a very interesting guy, and the inventor of the \\"climate change levy\\" that is driving industry in this country nuts. Please look this over. Steve and I have to get together, preferably with Ken, which leads me to suggest Aspen during the Institute's energy forum, which I understand Ken will be attending. But if that is not feasible, Steve and I can work out a date for a preliminary meeting, followed up by one with Ken at his convenience.

May they Rest In Peacepic.twitter.com/vB3k6vNz2y ||||| Two Iraqi citizens living in Bowling Green, Ky., who admitted using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against U.S. soldiers in Iraq and who attempted to send weapons and money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) for the purpose of killing U.S. soldiers, were sentenced today to serve federal prison terms by Senior Judge Thomas B. Russell in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. The sentences was announced Lisa Monaco, Assistant Attorney General for National Security; David J. Hale, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Kentucky; and Perrye K. Turner, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Louisville Division. Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 25, a former resident of Iraq, was sentenced to life in federal prison, and Waad Ramadan Alwan, 31, a former resident of Iraq, was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison, followed by a life term of supervised release. Both defendants had pleaded guilty to federal terrorism charges. “These two former Iraqi insurgents participated in terrorist activities overseas and attempted to continue providing material support to terrorists while they lived here in the United States. With today’s sentences, both men are being held accountable,” said Assistant Attorney General Monaco. “I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.” “These are experienced terrorists who willingly and enthusiastically participated in what they believed were insurgent support operations designed to harm American soldiers in Iraq,” stated U.S. Attorney Hale. “The serious crimes of both men merit lengthy punishment, and only the value of Alwan’s immediate and extensive cooperation with law enforcement justifies our recommendation of a reduced sentence for him. Bringing these men to justice is the result of a comprehensive law enforcement effort. The FBI agents of the Louisville Division, along with the federal and local law enforcement members of the Joint Terrorism Task Forces here in Kentucky, including the Bowling Green Police Department, and our many other partners, are to be commended.” “Protecting the United States from terrorist attacks remains the FBI's top priority,” said FBI Special Agent in Charge Turner. “Using our growing suite of investigative and intelligence capabilities, FBI agents and analysts assigned to our Bowling Green office were able to neutralize a potential threat. Our local Joint Terrorism Task Force, comprised of FBI Agents and other local, state and federal agencies from across the Commonwealth, remains committed to dismantling extremist networks and cutting off financing and other forms of support provided by terrorist sympathizers, whether they are operating in Kentucky or worldwide.” “Today, the sentencing of Alwan and Hammadi represents the culmination of the extensive, effective and focused efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Kentucky Division of the FBI for their roles in the investigation and prosecution of these would-be terrorists. I want to thank U.S. Attorney David Hale, the Kentucky Division of the FBI and the members of the FBI Bowling Green local office for their individual and collective efforts in bringing Alwan and Hammadi to justice for their crimes against the people of Kentucky and the United States,” stated Chief Doug Hawkins, Bowling Green Police Department. Alwan, whose fingerprints were found on an unexploded IED found in Iraq, pleaded guilty earlier in the case on Dec. 16, 2011, to all counts of a 23-count federal indictment. He pleaded guilty to conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad; conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) against U.S. nationals abroad; distributing information on the manufacture and use of IEDs; attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to AQI and conspiring to transfer, possess and export Stinger missiles. Hammadi pleaded guilty on Aug. 21, 2012, to a 12-count superseding indictment. Charges against him included attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to AQI; conspiring to transfer, possess and export Stinger missiles; and making a false statement in an immigration application. At today’s sentencing, at the request of the United States, Alwan received a reduced sentence due to his cooperation with federal law enforcement. The United States asked for no reduction of Hammadi’s sentence. According to information presented by the United States in connection with today’s sentencings, Hammadi and Alwan both admitted, in FBI interviews that followed waiver of their Miranda rights, to participation in the purported material support operations in Kentucky, and both provided the FBI details of their prior involvement in insurgent activities while living in Iraq. Both men believed their activities in Kentucky were supporting AQI. Alwan admitted participating in IED attacks against U.S. soldiers in Iraq, and Hammadi admitted to participating in 10 to 11 IED attacks as well as shooting at a U.S. soldier in an observation tower. Court documents filed in this case reveal that the Bowling Green office of the FBI’s Louisville Division initiated an investigation of Alwan in which they used a confidential human source (CHS). The CHS met with Alwan and recorded their meetings and conversations beginning in August 2010. The CHS represented to Alwan that he was working with a group to ship money and weapons to Mujahadeen in Iraq. From September 2010 through May 2011, Alwan participated in ten separate operations to send weapons and money that he believed were destined for terrorists in Iraq. Between October 2010 and January 2011, Alwan drew diagrams of multiple types of IEDs and instructed the CHS how to make them. In January 2011, Alwan recruited Hammadi, a fellow Iraqi national living in Bowling Green, to assist in these material support operations. Beginning in January 2011 and continuing until his arrest in late May 2011, Hammadi participated with Alwan in helping load money and weapons that he believed were destined for terrorists in Iraq. Documents filed by the United States describe in detail the material support activities of the men in Bowling Green. Without Hammadi present, Alwan loaded money and weapons he believed were being sent to Iraq on five occasions from September 2010 through February 2011, handling five rocket-propelled grenade launchers, five machine guns, two sniper rifles, two cases of C4 explosive and what he believed to be 375,000. After Hammadi joined Alwan in January 2011, the two men loaded money and weapons together on five occasions from January to May 2011. Together, on these five occasions, they loaded five rocket-propelled grenade launchers, five machine guns, five cases of C4 explosive, two sniper rifles, one box of 12 hand grenades, two Stinger surface-to-air missile launchers and what they believed to be a total of 565,000. Alwan and Hammadi were recorded by video during these operations. In speaking with the CHS, Alwan spoke of his efforts to kill U.S. soldiers in Iraq, stating “lunch and dinner would be an American.” Hammadi told the CHS that he had experience in Iraq with “Strelas” (a Russian made, portable, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile launcher) and discussed shipping “Strelas” in future operations. According to the charging documents, Hammadi entered the United States in July 2009, and, after first residing in Las Vegas, moved to Bowling Green. Hammadi and Alwan were arrested on May 25, 2011, in Bowling Green on criminal complaints. Both defendants were closely monitored by federal law enforcement authorities in the months leading up to their arrests. Neither was charged with plotting attacks within the United States. All of the weapons, including Stinger missiles, had been rendered inert before being handled by Hammadi and Alwan. The weapons and money handled by the men in the United States were never provided to AQI, but instead were carefully controlled by law enforcement as part of the undercover operation. This case was investigated by the Louisville Division of the FBI. Assisting in the investigation were members of the Louisville and Lexington Joint Terrorism Task Forces, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Bowling Green Police Department. The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Michael Bennett and Bryan Calhoun from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Kentucky and Trial Attorney Larry Schneider from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division. ||||| Kellyanne Conway, a senior adviser to Donald Trump, has come in for criticism and ridicule after blaming two Iraqi refugees for a massacre that never happened. Conway, the US president’s former campaign manager who has frequently faced the press to defend his controversial moves, cited the fictitious “Bowling Green massacre” in an interview in which she backed the travel ban imposed on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. Interviewed by Chris Matthews on MSNBC’s Hardball programme on Thursday evening, Conway compared the executive order issued by Trump in his first week in the White House to what she described as a six-month ban imposed by his predecessor Barack Obama. This claim has been debunked by commentators who have pointed out that the 2011 action was a pause on the processing of refugees from Iraq after two Iraqi nationals were arrested over a failed attempt to send money and weapons to al-Qaida in Iraq. Conway told Matthews: “I bet it’s brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalised and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. “Most people don’t know that because it didn’t get covered.” Trump defends chaotic foreign policy: 'We're going to straighten it out, OK?' Read more It didn’t get covered, many are now pointing out, because there was no such massacre. The two Iraqi men arrested in 2011 did live in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and are currently serving life sentences for federal terrorism offences. But there was no massacre, nor were they accused of planning one. The US department of justice, announcing their convictions in 2012, said: “Neither was charged with plotting attacks within the United States.” Analysis by the Cato Institute of terrorist attacks on US soil between 1975 and 2015 found that foreign nationals from the seven countries targeted by Trump’s travel ban – Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia – have killed no Americans. Following the Conway interview, some social media users pointed out that false rumours about a Halloween massacre had circulated in several universities, including Ohio’s Bowling Green state university, in 1998. But the likelihood that Conway had Kentucky in mind was bolstered when that state’s senator Rand Paul also made a variation of her false claim. In a separate interview with MSNBC, Paul referred to “the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, where I live”. Joe Sonka (@joesonka) Rand Paul: \\"...the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, where I live.\\" (Prosecutor said there was no attempt or even plot to bomb in America) pic.twitter.com/O0BMEgk4XF Conway had already prompted astonishment by describing comments by White House spokesman Sean Spicer that Trump’s inauguration crowd “was the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration, period” as “alternative facts”. “You’re saying it’s a falsehood, and they’re giving – Sean Spicer, our press secretary, gave alternative facts to that,” Conway told NBC last week. Matthews did not press Conway on her Bowling Green massacre claim in the interview, and she has not yet responded to reports that she misrepresented the events of 2011. ||||| Several dozen suspected terrorist bombmakers, including some believed to have targeted American troops, may have mistakenly been allowed to move to the United States as war refugees, according to FBI agents investigating the remnants of roadside bombs recovered from Iraq and Afghanistan. The discovery in 2009 of two al Qaeda-Iraq terrorists living as refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky -- who later admitted in court that they'd attacked U.S. soldiers in Iraq -- prompted the bureau to assign hundreds of specialists to an around-the-clock effort aimed at checking its archive of 100,000 improvised explosive devices collected in the war zones, known as IEDs, for other suspected terrorists' fingerprints. \\"We are currently supporting dozens of current counter-terrorism investigations like that,\\" FBI Agent Gregory Carl, director of the Terrorist Explosive Device Analytical Center (TEDAC), said in an ABC News interview to be broadcast tonight on ABC News' \\"World News with Diane Sawyer\\" and \\"Nightline\\". \\"I wouldn't be surprised if there were many more than that,\\" said House Committee on Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul. \\"And these are trained terrorists in the art of bombmaking that are inside the United States; and quite frankly, from a homeland security perspective, that really concerns me.\\" As a result of the Kentucky case, the State Department stopped processing Iraq refugees for six months in 2011, federal officials told ABC News – even for many who had heroically helped U.S. forces as interpreters and intelligence assets. One Iraqi who had aided American troops was assassinated before his refugee application could be processed, because of the immigration delays, two U.S. officials said. In 2011, fewer than 10,000 Iraqis were resettled as refugees in the U.S., half the number from the year before, State Department statistics show. Suspect in Kentucky Discovered to Have Insurgent Past An intelligence tip initially led the FBI to Waad Ramadan Alwan, 32, in 2009. The Iraqi had claimed to be a refugee who faced persecution back home -- a story that shattered when the FBI found his fingerprints on a cordless phone base that U.S. soldiers dug up in a gravel pile south of Bayji, Iraq on Sept. 1, 2005. The phone base had been wired to unexploded bombs buried in a nearby road. An ABC News investigation of the flawed U.S. refugee screening system, which was overhauled two years ago, showed that Alwan was mistakenly allowed into the U.S. and resettled in the leafy southern town of Bowling Green, Kentucky, a city of 60,000 which is home to Western Kentucky University and near the Army's Fort Knox and Fort Campbell. Alwan and another Iraqi refugee, Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, 26, were resettled in Bowling Green even though both had been detained during the war by Iraqi authorities, according to federal prosecutors. Most of the more than 70,000 Iraqi war refugees in the U.S. are law-abiding immigrants eager to start a new life in America, state and federal officials say. But the FBI discovered that Alwan had been arrested in Kirkuk, Iraq, in 2006 and confessed on video made of his interrogation then that he was an insurgent, according to the U.S. military and FBI, which obtained the tape a year into their Kentucky probe. In 2007, Alwan went through a border crossing to Syria and his fingerprints were entered into a biometric database maintained by U.S. military intelligence in Iraq, a Directorate of National Intelligence official said. Another U.S. official insisted that fingerprints of Iraqis were routinely collected and that Alwan's fingerprint file was not associated with the insurgency. “ ” How do they get into our community? In 2009 Alwan applied as a refugee and was allowed to move to Bowling Green, where he quit a job he briefly held and moved into public housing on Gordon Ave., across the street from a school bus stop, and collected public assistance payouts, federal officials told ABC News. \\"How do you have somebody that we now know was a known actor in terrorism overseas, how does that person get into the United States? How do they get into our community?\\" wondered Bowling Green Police Chief Doug Hawkins, whose department assisted the FBI. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Peter Boogaard said in a statement that the U.S. government \\"continually improves and expands its procedures for vetting immigrants, refugees and visa applicants, and today [the] vetting process considers a far broader range of information than it did in past years.\\" \\"Our procedures continue to check applicants' names and fingerprints against records of individuals known to be security threats, including the terrorist watchlist, or of law enforcement concern... These checks are vital to advancing the U.S. government's twin goal of protecting the world's most vulnerable persons while ensuring U.S. national security and public safety,\\" the statement said. Last year, a Department of Homeland Security senior intelligence official testified in a House hearing that Alwan and Hammadi's names and fingerprints were checked by the FBI, DHS and the Defense Department during the vetting process in 2009 and \\"came in clean.\\" After the FBI received the intelligence tip later that year, a sting operation in Kentucky was mounted to bait Alwan with a scheme hatched by an undercover operative recruited by the FBI, who offered Alwan the opportunity to ship heavy arms to al Qaeda in Iraq. The FBI wanted to know if Alwan was part of a local terror cell -- a fear that grew when he tapped a relative also living in Bowling Green, Hammadi, to help out. The FBI secretly taped Alwan bragging to the informant that he'd built a dozen or more bombs in Iraq and used a sniper rifle to kill American soldiers in the Bayji area north of Baghdad. \\"He said that he had them 'for lunch and dinner,'\\" recalled FBI Louisville Supervisory Special Agent Tim Beam, \\"meaning that he had killed them.\\" Alwan even sketched out IED designs, which the FBI provided to ABC News, that U.S. bomb experts had quickly determined clearly demonstrated his expertise. 'Needle in a Haystack' Fingerprint Match Found on Iraq Bomb Parts, White House Briefed The case drew attention at the highest levels of government, FBI officials told ABC News, when TEDAC forensic investigators tasked with finding IEDs from Bayji dating back to 2005 pulled 170 case boxes and, incredibly, found several of Alwan's fingerprints on a Senao-brand remote cordless base station. A U.S. military Significant Action report on Sept. 1, 2005 said the remote-controlled trigger had been attached to \\"three homemade-explosive artillery rounds concealed by gravel with protruding wires.\\" \\"There were two fingerprints, developed on the top of the base station,\\" Katie Suchma, an FBI supervisory physical scientist at TEDAC who helped locate the evidence, told ABC News at the center's IED examination lab. \\"The whole team was ecstatic because it was like finding a needle in a haystack.\\" \\"This was the type of bomb he's talking about when he drew those pictures,\\" added FBI electronics expert Stephen Mallow. Word was sent back to the FBI in Louisville. \\"It was a surreal moment, it was a real game changer, so to speak, for the case,\\" FBI agent Beam told ABC News. \\"Now you have solidified proof that he was involved in actual attacks against U.S. soldiers.\\" Worse, prosecutors later revealed at Hammadi's sentencing hearing that he and Alwan had been caught on an FBI surveillance tape talking about using a bomb to assassinate an Army captain they'd known in Bayji, who was now back home – and to possibly attack other homeland targets. \\"Many things should take place and it should be huge,\\" Hammadi told Alwan in an FBI-recorded conversation, which a prosecutor read at Hammadi's sentencing last year. Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller briefed President Obama in early 2011 as agents and Louisville federal prosecutors weighed whether to arrest Alwan and Hammadi or continue arranging phony arms shipments to Iraq that the pair could assist with, consisting of machine guns, explosives and even Stinger missiles the FBI had secretly rendered inoperable and which never left the U.S. But agents soon determined there were no other co-conspirators. An FBI SWAT team collared the terrorists in a truck south of Bowling Green in late May 2011, only weeks after al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan and Obama had visited nearby Fort Campbell to thank the SEALs and Army Nightstalker pilots for their successful mission. The Kentucky al Qaeda case drew little attention as the nation celebrated Bin Laden's death. Suspects Linked to Attack That Killed 4 US Soldiers Pennsylvania National Guard soldiers who had served in Bayji in 2005 saw news reports about the two arrests, and Army Staff Sgt. Joshua Hedetniemi called the FBI to alert them to an Aug. 9, 2005, IED attack that killed four of their troopers in a humvee patrolling south of the town. The U.S. attorney's office in Louisville eventually placed the surviving soldiers in its victim notification system for the case, even though it couldn't be conclusively proven that Alwan and Hammadi had killed the Guardsmen. The four Pennsylvania soldiers killed that day were Pfc. Nathaniel DeTample, 19, Spec. Gennaro Pellegrini, 31, Spec. Francis J. Straub Jr., 24, and Spec. John Kulick, 35. \\"It was a somber moment for the platoon, we had a great deal of love and respect for those guys and it hit us pretty hard,\\" Hedetniemi said in an interview in the Guard's armory near Philadelphia. \\"I think that these two individuals are innately evil to be able to act as a terrorist and attack and kill American soldiers, then have the balls to come over to the United States and try to do the same exact thing here in our homeland.\\" Confronted with all the evidence against them, Alwan and Hammadi agreed to plead guilty to supporting terrorism and admitted their al Qaeda-Iraq past. Alwan cooperated and received 40 years, while Hammadi received a life term which he is appealing. A hearing for Hammadi's appeal took place Tuesday in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio. \\"We need to take this as a case study and draw the right lessons from it, and not just high-five over this,\\" said retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Barbero, who headed the military's Joint IED Defeat Organization until last May. \\"How did a person who we detained in Iraq -- linked to an IED attack, we had his fingerprints in our government system -- how did he walk into America in 2009?\\" Barbero is credited with leveraging the Kentucky case to help the FBI get funding to create a new state of the art fingerprint lab focused solely on its IED repository in a huge warehouse outside Washington. The new FBI lab assists counterterrorism investigations of suspected bombmakers and IED emplacers and looks for latent prints on 100,000 IED remnants collected over the past decade by the military and stored in the vast TEDAC warehouse. The only man in the Humvee to survive the 2005 IED bombing in Bayji, Daniel South, who is now an Army Black Hawk helicopter pilot in Texas, said he was stunned to learn al Qaeda-Iraq insurgents were living in Kentucky -- but he's glad they were finally brought to justice for attacking U.S. troops in Iraq. \\"I kind of wish that we had smoked [Alwan] when it happened, but we didn't have that opportunity so I guess this is second best,\\" South told ABC News.

She told MSNBC's Chris Matthews: \\"I bet it's brand new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. It didn't get covered.\\" First of all, Obama didn't ban the Iraqi refugee program. Second, there's no such thing as the Bowling Green massacre. Conway later clarified that she was referencing the case of two Iraqis -- Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi -- who lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Both were granted refugee status and entered the United States in 2009. \\"On @hardball@NBCNews@MSNBC I meant to say 'Bowling Green terrorists' as reported here,\\" she said, before linking to an ABC news story on the case. Mohanad Shareef Hammadi Waad Ramadan Alwan The two men were never planning on committing an act of terrorism on US soil. Instead, they were trying to help get weapons to al Qaeda in Iraq. They were terrorists who should not have been allowed in the country, but they weren't planning an attack in the United States. And they didn't kill anyone in Bowling Green (or anywhere else in the US). CNN has reached out to the White House seeking comment of Conway's statement and have not yet received a response. Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of Trump's general election Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton, referenced Conway's comments in a tweet Friday morning , saying \\"don't make up fake attacks.\\" \\"Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks.\\" Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 Some background on that case: After arriving in the United States, the men were monitored by federal authorities. They told an FBI confidential informant that they wanted to provide weapons and explosives to al Qaeda in Iraq, court documents said. An extensive undercover sting operation was launched, authorities said, and Alwan -- who a Justice Department official once called \\"a really bad guy\\" -- told an undercover agent he had been involved with \\"hundreds\\" of IEDs. An indictment released at the time said the United States was able to locate Alwan's fingerprints on an IED and on the base of a cordless phone used in an attack near Bayji, Iraq in the early 2000s. That the vetting process didn't work and that these men were allowed into the country highlighted serious flaws in the refugee resettlement system and led to reforms of the vetting process. As a result, Obama ordered that 57,000-58,000 Iraqi refugees recently allowed into the country be revetted, causing a massive backlog. So, while there was no specific 'ban' on Iraqi refugees coming into the country, there was a delay in allowing anymore in. ||||| CLOSE Many will have you believe that President Obama's 2011 immigration order is the same as President Trump's travel ban. Veuer's Nick Cardona has the story. Buzz60 A woman yells as she protests President Trump's executive immigration ban at O'Hare International Airport on Jan. 29, 2017 in Chicago. (Photo: Joshua Lott, AFP/Getty Images) In defending his executive order banning immigration and travel from certain countries, which has touched off widespread anger and confusion, President Trump compared the order to action taken by the Obama administration in 2011. CLOSE In response to the protests across the country against President Donald Trump's travel ban, former President Obama issued his first public statement since leaving office. Veuer's Nick Cardona has that story. Buzz60 “My policy is similar to what President Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months,” Trump claimed. Obama administration officials and fact checkers say the claim is wrong. Trump’s order banned visitors from seven Middle Eastern countries — Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Sudan and Syria — from coming to the United States for 90 days. The executive order signed Friday also suspended for 120 days all refugees coming to the United States. In 2011, the State Department significantly slowed the number of visas it issued to Iraqis in order to review its vetting process. The concern stemmed from the arrests of two Iraqi refugees on terrorism charges in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 2011. One of the men was linked through fingerprints to an improvised explosive attack in Bayji, Iraq. The arrests triggered concerns in the administration and on Capitol Hill and led to a massive review of Iraqi refugees already admitted to the country and more extensive vetting of those applying to immigrate to the United States. The action only applied to refugees from Iraq. MORE: Obama's office released a statement Monday that, while not directly critical of President Trump, did applaud those protesting a travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim countries. \\"President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country. In his final official speech as President, he spoke about the important role of citizen and how all Americans have a responsibility to be the guardians of our democracy — not just during an election but every day,\\" Obama spokesman Kevin Lewis said in a statement. \\"With regard to comparisons to President Obama’s foreign policy decisions, as we’ve heard before, the President fundamentally disagrees with the notion of discriminating against individuals because of their faith or religion,\\" Lewis added. Jon Finer, an Obama administration official, said the review slowed the pace of Iraqis coming into the United States, but never completely halted it. The “flow of Iraqi refugees slowed significantly during the Obama administration’s review,” Finer wrote in an article for Foreign Policy magazine’s website, but “there was no outright ban.” But in 2012, the flow of refugees from Iraqi had returned to close to pre-2011 numbers. Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post’s fact checker, gave the Trump claim “three Pinocchios,” indicating a “significant factual error.” He cited several differences between the Obama administration action and Trump’s recent executive order: Obama’s action was in response to a specific threat, it was not a complete halt of refugees from Iraq and it did not apply to all visitors from Iraq entering the United States, he said.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","completion":"The supposed perturbation in this case is indirectly impacting a step of the process. To elaborate further, let's go through each mentioned step of the process and understand how keeping the bread in a breadbin affects it. 1. Bread is exposed to the elements: When stored in a breadbin, the bread is sheltered from direct exposure to external elements, such as air and dust, which reduces the likelihood of mold spores landing on the bread. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air: The breadbin works as a barrier to prevent excessive moisture from entering and accumulating within the bread. In a breadbin, the humidity level can be regulated to some extent, depending on the design and material of the breadbin. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: Breadbins are usually made from materials that provide insulation. This helps to maintain a stable temperature inside the breadbin, preventing the bread from absorbing excessive warmth from its surrounding environment. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: The breadbin acts as a physical barrier to minimize the presence of dust particles and mold spores directly landing on the bread. This indirectly affects the mold growth on the bread by reducing its exposure to mold spores. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: Although keeping the bread in a breadbin may reduce the number of mold spores landing on the bread, if the bread is already contaminated, the mold spores will start consuming the bread for energy. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: The growth of mold colonies is affected by the humidity, temperature, and availability of mold spores. The breadbin indirectly impacts these factors to a certain extent, potentially slowing down the growth of mold colonies, but not completely stopping it. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of keeping bread in a breadbin indirectly impacts the steps in the process that lead to mold growth on the bread. It creates a more controlled environment for the bread, reducing exposure to elements like air, dust, and moisture, which in turn can slow down the mold growth process. However, this does not mean that the bread will remain mold-free indefinitely, as the breadbin cannot completely eliminate all factors that contribute to mold growth."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

Article: After studying the daily habits of 177 self-made millionaires over the course of five years, Thomas C. Corley found that they avoid one costly habit: procrastination . \\"It prevents even the most talented individuals from realizing success in life,\\" he writes in his upcoming book, \\"Change Your Habits, Change Your Life.\\" This goes hand-in-hand with author Napoleon Hill's claim that the wealthiest people are also the most decisive people. Out of the 500 millionaires Hill studied in the early 20thcentury, \\"Every one of them had the habit of reaching decisions quickly,\\" Hill wrote in his 1937 classic, \\"Think and Grow Rich.\\" One of the major causes of procrastination is lack of passion, Corley emphasizes: \\"We simply like to do the things we like to do and we put off the things we do not like to do.\\" \\"According to Gallup, only 13% of employees are 'engaged' in their jobs, or emotionally invested in their work,\\" Corley writes. \\"Whether you realize it or not, procrastination is a big reason why you are struggling financially in life. It damages your credibility with employers and fellow colleagues at work. It also affects the quality of your work and this affects the business you or your employer receive from customers, clients, and business relationships.\\" The good news is that anyone can overcome procrastination -- and it's simpler than you may think. He also notes that \\"the voice of procrastination screams just as loud and clear in the minds of those who _ in life as it does in the minds of those who do not.\\" How do they silence it? They rely on \\"to-do\\" lists to get things done. They create firm deadlines, and they meet with \\"accountability partners\\" to ensure they're sticking to their goals and deadlines, Corley says. Nearly everyone is susceptible to procrastination -- but fighting against it can make all the difference.

On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward.

She is startled as the stranger pulls out a kukri and starts spinning the carousel. The kukri is held up in the air and the terrified woman goes around until she's struck with it. Judd Austin (Leonard Mann) is the cop assigned to the case. He is called to the scene and when he gets there, he sees the girl decapitated, with her head in a bucket of water nearby. The distraught director of the center tells the officer that Anne worked there during the day and was attending night classes at Wendall College. At the hospital, Judd and his partner Taj (Joseph R. Sicari) discuss a similar case from the previous week; another girl was found decapitated and her head in a pond. They begin to question if there's any connection between the two murders. At Wendell, the administrator Miss Helene Griffin (Annette Miller) tells Judd that Anne was close to a girl named Kim Morrison (Elizabeth Barnitz). When asked if Anne had a boyfriend, Kim tells the officer that the murdered girl was indeed involved with someone but she doesn't know who it was.

He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes.

Or watch any news program and see how they will report the detail of any minor celebrity in the off chance that it leads to a bigger, more exciting story. Then they can run ads that say, \\"We were the first news team to bring you the story of Jennifer Aniston's new puppy.\\" Now, imagine if you could get paid to be that cool, hip person who gets try products and services before anyone else?

You not only get paid to be the first person to try a new item, but your opinion matters. You can't beat that. CareerBuilder.com: Food workers, nurses forced to work sick. Here are five jobs that let you try an item before everyone else buys it:. 1. Video game tester. Yes, people are paid to test video games. This job isn't all fun and games, although it sort of is. But someone has to try new video games and look for flaws or glitches so programmers and designers can fix them before the release date. Consider how complicated today's video games are -- you're immersed in an interactive world that has come a long way from the 2-D world of Mario and Luigi. There are bound to be items that are overlooked, like a door that leads to nowhere or a secret code that doesn't do what it's supposed to. 2. Consumer Reports researcher. Independent testing organization Consumer Reports carries out extensive tests on products, such as cars, gadgets and home furnishings. A dedicated staff researches a product that is put through a battery of tests. They then administer a grade and detailed report for the product so that consumers know what its positive and negative attributes are. CareerBuilder.com: Have an incompetent boss? You're not alone. 3. Blogger. As blogging has shifted from a niche activity for a few writers to a respected outlet for news and topical conversations, bloggers have been granted some impressive privileges. Among them is access to conferences and company events, such as the unveiling of a new smartphone. Months before a new music player, smartphone or computer lands in your local retail store, the company announces it with great fanfare at a launch event. Bloggers who have large readership and respect in an industry are given prime seats at these events, where they can get their hands on these new gadgets minutes after they're unveiled. 4. Ice cream tester. If you thought testing video games was fun, consider the sheer joy of getting paid to try ice cream. Before you pick up a pint of a new, exotic flavor at the grocery store, someone had to make sure it was edible. For every whacky flavor like bubble gum, some food scientists tried out less successful flavors like spaghetti or pumpkin-wheatgrass. So the idea of eating ice cream for a living sounds fun until you realize it also means tasting some undesirable attempts, too. (Not to mention the damage done to your waistline.) CareerBuilder.com: Conflicting career advice: Which is right. 5. Critics. Before you see the must-see movie of the year, someone had to declare it a must-see film. Critics get to screen films weeks or months in advance so they can write a review for a magazine or newspaper before opening day. Music critics also get first stab at new albums. Record labels and movie studios give critics first access because their reviews drum up publicity for the respective projects -- and they hope the reviewers are positive, though there's no guarantee. Either way, critics get to enjoy some of pop culture's finest experiences for free. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

Sentence 1: In Thorn's vision Jon saw Vrenna beginning her dance, parrying at her opponent's wrist instead of crossing blades. Sentence 2: Vrenna does not cross blades with her opponent. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence is true, given the information provided in the first sentence. In the first sentence, Thorn's vision reveals Jon witnessing Vrenna starting her dance. During this dance, she is actively engaged in a sword fight with an opponent. Instead of choosing to cross blades with her adversary, Vrenna opts for a different tactic; she aims to parry at her opponent's wrist. Parrying is a defensive move in sword fighting, where a person deflects or blocks an incoming attack, often with the intent of creating an opportunity for a counterattack. The second sentence states that Vrenna does not cross blades with her opponent. Crossing blades usually refers to a situation in which two sword fighters lock their swords together, often accompanied by a test of strength or a stalemate. Based on the information in the first sentence, Vrenna chooses to parry her opponent's wrist rather than engaging in the act of crossing blades. Therefore, the second sentence is consistent with the information provided in the first sentence and can be considered to be true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, Capote was the son of 17-year-old Lillie Mae Faulk and salesman Archulus Persons. His parents divorced when he was four, and he was sent to Monroeville, Alabama, where, for the following four to five years, he was raised by his mother's relatives. He formed a fast bond with his mother's distant relative, Nanny Rumbley Faulk, whom Truman called \\"Sook\\". \\"Her face is remarkable - not unlike Lincoln's, craggy like that, and tinted by sun and wind\\", is how Capote described Sook in \\"A Christmas Memory\\" (1956). The critical success of one of his short stories, \\"Miriam\\" (1945), attracted the attention of the publisher Bennett Cerf, resulting in a contract with Random House to write a novel. With an advance of 1,500, Capote returned to Monroeville and began Other Voices, Other Rooms, continuing to work on the manuscript in New Orleans, Saratoga Springs, New York, and North Carolina, eventually completing it in Nantucket, Massachusetts. It was published in 1948. Capote described this symbolic tale as \\"a poetic explosion in highly suppressed emotion\\". The novel is a semi-autobiographical refraction of Capote's Alabama childhood. Decades later, writing in The Dogs Bark (1973), he commented: Other Voices, Other Rooms was an attempt to exorcise demons, an unconscious, altogether intuitive attempt, for I was not aware, except for a few incidents and descriptions, of its being in any serious degree autobiographical. Rereading it now, I find such self-deception unpardonable. The story focuses on 13-year-old Joel Knox following the loss of his mother. Joel is sent from New Orleans to live with his father, who abandoned him at the time of his birth. Arriving at Skully's Landing, a vast, decaying mansion in rural Alabama, Joel meets his sullen stepmother Amy, debauched transvestite Randolph, and defiant Idabel, a girl who becomes his friend. He also sees a spectral \\"queer lady\\" with \\"fat dribbling curls\\" watching him from a top window. Despite Joel's queries, the whereabouts of his father remain a mystery. When he finally is allowed to see his father, Joel is stunned to find he is a quadriplegic, having tumbled down a flight of stairs after being inadvertently shot by Randolph. Joel runs away with Idabel but catches pneumonia and eventually returns to the Landing, where he is nursed back to health by Randolph. The implication in the final paragraph is that the \\"queer lady\\" beckoning from the window is Randolph in his old Mardi Gras costume. Gerald Clarke, in Capote: A Biography (1988) described the conclusion: Finally, when he goes to join the queer lady in the window, Joel accepts his destiny, which is to be homosexual, to always hear other voices and live in other rooms. Yet acceptance is not a surrender; it is a liberation. \\"I am me\\", he whoops. \\"I am Joel, we are the same people.\\" So, in a sense, had Truman rejoiced when he made peace with his own identity. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Truman Capote was a writer who was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. When he was little, his parents separated, and he moved to Alabama to live with his mom's family. He became close to a relative named Sook. Truman wrote a lot of stories, and one day, a famous publisher liked his story and gave him a chance to write a book. He wrote a book called Other Voices, Other Rooms, which had some parts similar to his own life.

Question: Where were Bactria, Sogdiana, and Margiana located in modern maps? Context: The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.

The eastern area of the park, where the first developments took place at the end of the 19th century, was then under the local government control of Stretford Urban District; the west was controlled by the urban district of Barton-upon-Irwell. Tensions soon began to emerge between the Estates Company and Stretford Council over the provision of local services and infrastructure. In 1902, W. T. Glover & Co, a cable manufacturing company that had moved to the park from nearby Salford, built a power station next to their works to supply electricity to the rest of the park; the Estates Company had previously approached Manchester Corporation, but Stretford would not allow another local authority to supply electricity within its area.In 1901 Manchester Corporation formally proposed a merger with Stretford UDC, on the basis that Stretford's growth was due in large part to Trafford Park, the growth of which in turn was largely due to the Manchester Ship Canal. Manchester Corporation had provided one-third of the capital needed to build the ship canal, for which it had doubled its municipal debt, despite having also increased rates by 26 per cent between 1892 and 1895. Stretford and Lancashire County Council opposed the merger, which was rejected following a government inquiry. In 1969 Pevsner wrote: \\"That [neighbouring] Stretford and Salford are not administratively one with Manchester is one of the most curious anomalies of England.\\"The tensions between Stretford and the Estates Company began to come to a head in 1906, when in response to complaints in the press about the state of one particular road in the park, Trafford Park Road, Stretford issued formal notices demanding that all premises with frontage onto the road pay for its improvement. Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford.

Choices: - hydra - globular - polypoid - medusa A: The answer is:","completion":"Most hydrozoa have both polyp and medusa forms in their life cycle. Hydrozoa is a class of relatively simple, mostly marine organisms belonging to the phylum Cnidaria, which also includes more familiar organisms like jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones. Hydrozoans display a characteristic life cycle known as metagenesis, which involves both asexual and sexual reproduction phases. The life cycle can be easily understood by looking at the two distinct body forms, namely polyps and medusae. Polyps are the sessile, or stationary, stage of the life cycle. They are typically cylindrical in shape, with a mouth opening at the top, surrounded by tentacles. Polyps are usually colonial, living in complex colonies called hydranths, which serve different functions such as feeding, reproduction, or defense. They reproduce asexually, primarily through budding - a process where a small outgrowth of the parent polyp detaches and develops into a new individual. Medusae, on the other hand, are the free-swimming, typically bell-shaped stage of the life cycle, generally referred to as the jellyfish stage. In contrast to polyps, medusae reproduce sexually. They possess both male and female reproductive organs (gonads) and release eggs and sperm into the water column. Fertilized eggs then develop into planktonic larvae called planulae, which eventually settle onto a solid substrate, metamorphose into a small polyp, and begin the asexual phase again. Some hydrozoans, like the freshwater Hydra, only exhibit the polyp stage, while others alternate between polyp and medusa forms throughout their life cycle. This alternation between the two forms helps ensure the long-term survival of the species, as it allows hydrozoans to adapt to and exploit a wide variety of environments and ecological niches and enhances dispersal potential. In conclusion, most members of the hydrozoa class exhibit both polyp and medusa forms throughout their life cycles. This distinction serves important functional and reproductive roles and allows these unique organisms to persist in diverse environments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How to referee two irritable cats that don't get along Desex your cats. This is especially important to control the behavior of male cats. Neutered male cats tend to have less problems with aggression and spraying, which is a sign of being territorial.","completion":"Step 1: Observe the cats closely Before intervening, it is essential to watch the cats and understand their triggers, body language, and individual personalities. This knowledge will be useful for addressing their needs and creating a peaceful environment. Step 2: Create separate spaces for the cats Designate separate areas for the cats, complete with their own food and water bowls, beds, and litter boxes. This can help reduce territorial arguments by giving each cat its own space. Step 3: Introduce calming techniques Use calming pheromone diffusers or sprays in the areas where the cats spend most of their time. These products can help relax the cats and lower stress levels. Step 4: Gradual reintroduction Start slowly reintroducing the cats to each other by allowing them to sniff and see each other through a barrier, like a baby gate. This way, they can get used to each other's presence without any physical contact. Step 5: Encourage positive interactions During supervised interactions, use treats, toys, and calming sprays to create a positive association between the cats. Encourage playtime and give rewards to both cats when they display friendly behavior. Step 6: Monitor progress Keep track of any improvement or regression in the cats' relationship. Pay attention to their body language and intervene if signs of aggression appear. It's crucial to be patient and persistent, as the process may take some time. Step 7: Consult a professional If the cats continue to show aggression or hostility towards each other despite consistent efforts, it may be necessary to consult a professional cat behaviorist or veterinarian for further guidance. By following these steps, it is possible to referee two irritable cats effectively and help them coexist peacefully. Remember that it is essential not to force interactions and remain patient throughout the entire process, as it may take time for the cats to get along."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people who see three ladies washing clothes in a river and singing? ? In 1937 Mississippi during the Great Depression, three convicts, Ulysses Everett McGill, Pete Hogwallop, and Delmar O'Donnell, escape from a chain gang and set out to retrieve a supposed treasure Everett buried, before its locale is flooded to make a lake and provide electricity for the state. The three get a lift from a blind man driving a handcar on a railway. He tells them, among other prophecies, that they will find a fortune but not the one they seek. The trio make their way to the house of Wash, Pete's cousin. They sleep in the barn, but Wash reports them to Sheriff Cooley, who, along with his men, torches the barn. After Pete angrily blows up Cooley's police van, Wash's son helps them escape. Pete and Delmar are baptized by a group of Christians at a river. The group then picks up Tommy Johnson, a young black man, who claims he has sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to play the guitar. In need of money, the four stop at a radio broadcast tower where they record a song as The Soggy Bottom Boys. That night, the trio part ways with Tommy after their car is discovered by the police. Unbeknownst to them, the recording becomes a major hit. The trio inadvertently fall in with bank robber George \\"Baby Face\\" Nelson, and help him with a heist, before he leaves them with his share of the loot. The next day, the group hears singing. They see three ladies washing clothes in a river and singing. The ladies drug them with corn liquor and they lose consciousness. Upon waking, Delmar finds Pete's clothes lying next to him, empty except for a toad. Delmar is convinced the ladies were Sirens and transformed Pete into the toad. Later, one-eyed Bible salesman Big Dan Teague invites them for a picnic lunch, then mugs them and kills the toad.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Similarity refers to the psychological nearness or proximity of two mental representations . It is one of the principles of grouping in Gestalt psychology According to Daniel Schachter \`\` Regions that are similar in color , lightness , shape , or texture are perceived as belonging to the same object '' Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity . Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation . - Attention is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration of consciousness are of its essence. Attention has also been referred to as the allocation of limited processing resources. - Personality psychology is a branch of psychology that studies personality and its variation among individuals. Its areas of focus include: - Developmental psychology is the scientific study of how and why human beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. This field examines change across a broad range of topics including: motor skills, cognitive development, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept and identity formation. - Perception (from the Latin \\"perceptio, percipio\\") is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the environment. All perception involves signals in the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sense organs. For example, vision involves light striking the retina of the eye, smell is mediated by odor molecules, and hearing involves pressure waves. Perception is not the passive receipt of these signals, but is shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention. - Mental process or mental function are all the things that individuals can do with their minds. These include perception, memory, thinking (such as ideation, imagination, belief, reasoning, etc.), volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term \\"cognitive function\\" is used instead. - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. - Abnormal psychology is the branch of psychology that studies unusual patterns of behavior, emotion and thought, which may or may not be understood as precipitating a mental disorder. Although many behaviours could be considered as abnormal, this branch of psychology generally deals with behavior in a clinical context. There is a long history of attempts to understand and control behavior deemed to be aberrant or deviant (statistically, morally or in some other sense), and there is often cultural variation in the approach taken. The field of abnormal psychology identifies multiple causes for different conditions, employing diverse theories from the general field of psychology and elsewhere, and much still hinges on what exactly is meant by \\"abnormal\\". There has traditionally been a divide between psychological and biological explanations, reflecting a philosophical dualism in regard to the mind body problem. There have also been different approaches in trying to classify mental disorders. Abnormal includes three different categories; they are subnormal, supernormal and paranormal. - Cognitive psychology is the study of mental processes such as \\"attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and thinking.\\" Much of the work derived from cognitive psychology has been integrated into various other modern disciplines of psychological study, including educational psychology, social psychology, personality psychology, abnormal psychology, developmental psychology, and economics. - Educational Psychology is the branch of psychology concerned with the scientific study of human learning. The study of learning processes, from both cognitive and behavioral perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in intelligence, cognitive development, affect, motivation, self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan. - Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In this definition, \\"scientific\\" refers to the empirical method of investigation. The terms \\"thoughts\\", \\"feelings\\", and \\"behaviors\\" include all psychological variables that are measurable in a human being. The statement that others' presence may be \\"imagined\\" or \\"implied\\" suggests that we are prone to social influence even when no other people are present, such as when watching television, or following internalized cultural norms. Social psychologists typically explain human behavior as a result of the interaction of mental states and immediate social situations. - Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition. Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology. The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that \\"thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures.\\" - A mental representation (or cognitive representation), in philosophy of mind, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive science, is a hypothetical internal cognitive symbol that represents external reality, or else a mental process that makes use of such a symbol: \\"a formal system for making explicit certain entities or types of information, together with a specification of how the system does this.\\" After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'similarity ' exhibits the relationship of 'facet of'.

Across the South, sharecropping evolved, in which landless black and white farmers worked land owned by others in return for a share of the profits. Some farmers rented the land and bore the production costs themselves. Until mechanical cotton pickers were developed, cotton farmers needed additional labor to hand-pick cotton. Picking cotton was a source of income for families across the South.

Some people in the South had land after the big war (the Civil War), but they didn't have enough money or workers to grow their cotton. Others didn't have land but could work. So, they made a deal: the workers would get to live on the land and grow cotton, and when it was time to sell it, they would share the money they made. This way, both sides got something they needed. Now, it's hard to give an exact number like \\"1 out of 5 people\\" who worked as sharecroppers in the South, because it's been a long time and we don't have all the details. But we do know that many people, both black and white, worked as sharecroppers after the war. They helped grow the cotton that was an important part of the Southern economy.

On an island near Antarctica, a male penguin named Peter sees a female named Polly, and attempts to woo her. First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help. The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence, \\"that not only fails on its own, but makes you second-guess your affection for the original,\\" can be considered negative. In this detailed analysis, we'll dissect the sentence to understand the negative sentiment. First, let's break down the sentence structure: 1. \\"that not only fails on its own\\" - This part of the sentence clearly shows a sense of failure. The use of \\"not only\\" amplifies the negative sentiment and tells us that there is something more to come. The fact that the subject in question \\"fails on its own\\" implies that it is incapable of succeeding or providing any satisfaction on an individual level. 2. \\"but makes you second-guess your affection for the original\\" - The conjunction \\"but\\" used here indicates a contrast, while \\"makes you second-guess\\" conveys a tone of doubt and disappointment. Furthermore, the term \\"your affection for the original\\" implies that the reader initially had a strong, positive emotional connection to the original item, but now, due to the subject under discussion, their confidence or faith in the original is being shaken. Taking the two parts of the sentence together, we can see that the negative sentiment comes from the incapability of the subject to succeed on its own, as well as the damage it does to one's appreciation of the original. The sentence implies that not only does the subject not meet expectations, it also has an adverse effect on something that was initially liked or appreciated, which effectively amplifies the negative sentiment. Overall, the combination of the two parts creates a sense of disapproval and disappointment, making the sentiment negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet. It usually ranges from positive to negative, with neutral as a midpoint. In this particular tweet, the user states that they have spilled water on their jeans. This event is likely to evoke feelings of inconvenience, annoyance or frustration. Spilling water, or any liquid, on one's clothes is something that most people would consider to be unfortunate or undesirable, as it can cause discomfort, require immediate attention, and potentially ruin or damage the clothing. Therefore, it wouldn't be associated with a positive emotion or experience.

Despite his team's loss, Robinson took a moment to share a tender embrace with his family, reminding everyone that football is not just about winning or losing, but also about the emotional connections that are formed between players, families, and supporters. The endearing scene provided a sense of consolation for Warrington fans, as their FA Cup journey came to a close. Robinson had played a crucial role in Warrington Town's victory over Exeter City in the first round, and his efforts on the pitch did not go unnoticed. Although their FA Cup dreams were dashed by Gateshead, Warrington Town could hold their heads high, knowing they put up a valiant fight against a higher-ranked team. As the teams left the field, both sets of fans applauded their respective players, acknowledging the hard work and commitment displayed throughout the match. The sense of camaraderie and sportsmanship was palpable, demonstrating the unifying power of the beautiful game. For players like Craig Robinson and Danny Wright, moments like these will be cherished and remembered for years to come, as they bask in the glow of their achievements on and off the field. Moreover, this passage underscores the importance of recognizing not only the victors in sports competitions, but also those who have played their hearts out and inspired others with their dedication and perseverance. The inclusion of a personal moment between a player and his loved ones shows that, ultimately, football is about far more than just the final whistle: it’s about the journey, the pride, and the love that players and fans alike share for the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who wants Loki to go back to Asgard? The Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract, a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., and his lieutenant Agent Maria Hill arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent Phil Coulson explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him in his getaway. In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the \\"Avengers Initiative\\". Agent Natasha Romanoff is sent to Calcutta to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches Steve Rogers with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract. In Stuttgart, Barton steals iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., Thor, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract. Answer:","completion":"Thor wants Loki to go back to Asgard."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: Dan harvested lots of fruit and decided to candy some of them to preserve them. He left some fruit fresh for the family to enjoy. He candied apples, pears, plums, and quince. He didn't candy oranges, blueberries, apricots and peaches.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which is this about? A new front has been opened in the long-dormant browser war, with an open-source program called Firefox aiming to challenge Microsoft #39;s dominant Internet Explorer.","completion":"The statement above refers to the emergence of the Firefox web browser as a new contender in the fiercely competitive browser market. Developed by the Mozilla Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to furthering open-source projects, Firefox rose to prominence in the mid-2000s as a viable alternative to Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE). The browser war refers to the intense rivalry between companies developing web browsers, each vying for the largest market share possible. Mozilla Firefox, first released in 2002 as a development project called Phoenix, was developed with the intention to create a lightweight and fast web browser built on the Gecko engine. The primary goal was to offer a more secure and user-friendly alternative to Internet Explorer, which, at that time, faced numerous security issues and criticism for its lack of standards compliance. This new front in the browser war was significant for several reasons: 1. **Increased choice for consumers:** The arrival of Firefox as a viable alternative meant that users had a choice between browsers, with each offering distinct features, interface designs, and customization options. This resulted in a more diverse and competitive browser market, leading to faster innovation and improvement of browser technologies. 2. **Challenging Microsoft's dominance:** At the height of its popularity, Internet Explorer held more than 90% of the market share, severely limiting competition and stifling innovation. Firefox played a crucial role in reducing this monopoly, paving the way for other browser alternatives like Google Chrome, Apple's Safari, and Opera to enter the market. 3. **Promoting open-source development:** Firefox's success demonstrated the strengths of open-source development. By encouraging collaboration amongst developers around the world, Firefox was able to secure a substantial share of the market, as well as support from other major players such as Google, which saw the value in backing the open-source project. 4. **Security and privacy improvements:** With its focus on providing a more secure browsing experience, Firefox introduced important security features such as the popup blocker and anti-phishing protection. Its commitment to user privacy also set an important precedent, with features like private browsing mode and the development of various privacy-focused browser extensions. 5. **Greater emphasis on standards compliance:** Firefox's commitment to adhering to web standards played an important role in improving the overall Web experience for users. By promoting the use of modern web technologies, it pushed Microsoft to improve its own standards support in subsequent versions of Internet Explorer, fostering a more uniform and consistent browsing experience across different browsers. Ultimately, the opening of this new front in the browser war marked a significant shift in the landscape of the market. The emergence and subsequent success of Firefox challenged Microsoft's dominance and changed the browser industry fundamentally by encouraging innovation, competition, and a greater focus on security, privacy, and standards compliance. This shift has continued to impact the browser market and has contributed to the development of the thriving, innovative ecosystem of web technologies that we see today."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Bodmin is a civil parish and major town in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated south-west of Bodmin Moor. - Londinium was a settlement established on the current site of the City of London around 43. Its bridge over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until its abandonment during the 5th century. - A conurbation is a region comprising a number of cities, large towns, and other urban areas that, through population growth and physical expansion, have merged to form one continuous urban or industrially developed area. In most cases, a conurbation is a polycentric urbanised area, in which transportation has developed to link areas to create a single urban labour market or travel to work area. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - The Mayor of London is an elected politician who, along with the London Assembly of 25 members, is accountable for the strategic government of Greater London. The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took up office on 9 May 2016. The position had been held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in 2008 by Boris Johnson, who served two terms before being succeeded by Khan. - Truro is a city and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. Truro is Cornwall's county town and only city, its centre for administration, leisure and retail and had a population recorded in the 2011 census of 18,766. It is the most southern city in mainland Great Britain. People from Truro are known as Truronians. - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany. The southern and western boundaries are delimited by the continental shelf, which drops away sharply. The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago of small islands in the sea. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Devon (archaically known as Devonshire) is a county of England, reaching from the Bristol Channel in the north to the English Channel in the south. It is part of South West England, bounded by Cornwall to the west, Somerset to the northeast, and Dorset to the east. The City of Exeter is the county town; seven other districts of East Devon, Mid Devon, North Devon, South Hams, Teignbridge, Torridge, and West Devon are under the jurisdiction of Devon County Council; Plymouth and Torbay are each a part of Devon but administered as unitary authorities. Combined as a ceremonial county, Devon's area is and its population is about 1.1 million. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - Camborne ('Crooked Hill') is a town and civil parish in west Cornwall, UK. It is at the western edge of a conurbation comprising Camborne, Pool and Redruth. - Middlesex (abbreviation: Middx) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London, with small sections in neighbouring counties. It was established in the Anglo-Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons, and existed as an official unit until 1965. The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from east to west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries. The largely low-lying county, dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south, was the second smallest by area in 1831. - Cornwall is a ceremonial county and unitary authority area of England within the United Kingdom. It is bordered to the north and west by the Celtic Sea, to the south by the English Channel, and to the east by the county of Devon, over the River Tamar. Cornwall has a population of and covers an area of . The administrative centre, and only city in Cornwall, is Truro, although the town of Falmouth has the largest population for a civil parish and the conurbation of Camborne, Pool and Redruth has the highest total population. - Bodmin Moor is a granite moorland in northeastern Cornwall, England. It is in size, and dates from the Carboniferous period of geological history. It includes Brown Willy, the highest point in Cornwall, and Rough Tor, a slightly lower peak. Many of Cornwall's rivers have their sources here. It has been inhabited since at least the Neolithic era, when primitive farmers started clearing trees and farming the land. They left their megalithic monuments, hut circles and cairns, and the Bronze Age culture that followed left further cairns, and more stone circles and stone rows. By medieval and modern times, nearly all the forest was gone and livestock rearing predominated. - The Tamar is a river in south west England, that forms most of the border between Devon (to the east) and Cornwall (to the west). The area is a World Heritage Site due to its historic mining activities. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - The London Assembly is an elected body, part of the Greater London Authority, that scrutinises the activities of the Mayor of London and has the power, with a two-thirds majority, to amend the Mayor's annual budget and to reject the Mayor's draft statutory strategies. The assembly was established in 2000 and meets at City Hall on the South Bank of the River Thames, close to Tower Bridge. The assembly is also able to investigate other issues of importance to Londoners (transport, environmental matters, etc.), publish its findings and recommendations, and make proposals to the Mayor. - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - A watchmaker is an artisan who makes and repairs watches. Since a majority of watches are now factory made, most modern watchmakers only repair watches. However, originally they were master craftsmen who built watches, including all their parts, by hand. Modern watchmakers, when required to repair older watches, for which replacement parts may not be available, must have fabrication skills, and can typically manufacture replacements for many of the parts found in a watch. The term clockmaker refers to an equivalent occupation specializing in clocks. - John Arnold ( born 1736 probably in Bodmin , Cornwall -- died 1799 in London ) was an English watchmaker and inventor . John Arnold was the first to design a watch that was both practical and accurate , and also brought the term \`\` Chronometer '' into use in its modern sense , meaning a precision timekeeper . His technical advances enabled the quantity production of Marine Chronometers for use on board ships from around 1782 . The basic design of these , with a few modifications unchanged until the late twentieth century . With regard to his legacy one can say that both he and Abraham - Louis Breguet largely invented the modern mechanical watch . Certainly one of his most important inventions , the Overcoil balance spring is still to be found in most mechanical wrist watches to this day . It is necessary to point out that the brand name Arnold & Son used by a Swiss watch company has absolutely no connection to the original firm founded by John Arnold . It was from around 1770 that Arnold developed the portable precision timekeeper , almost from the point where John Harrison ended his work in this field . But compared to Harrison 's complicated and expensive watch , Arnold 's basic design was simple whilst consistently accurate and mechanically reliable . Importantly , the relatively simple and conventional design of his movement facilitated its production in quantity at a reasonable price whilst also enabling easier maintenance and adjustment . But three elements were necessary for this achievement : A detached escapement , which gave minimal interference with the vibrating balance and balance spring A balance design that enabled compensation for the effect of temperature on the balance spring A method for adjusting the balance spring , so that the balance oscillates in equal time periods , even through different degrees of balance arc - Surrey is a county in the south east of England and also one of the home counties bordering Greater London. Surrey shares borders with Kent to the east, East Sussex to the south-east, West Sussex to the south, Hampshire to the west and south-west and Berkshire to the north-west. The county town is Guildford. Surrey County Council sits extraterritorially at Kingston upon Thames, administered as part of Greater London since 1965. With a resident population of 1.1 million, Surrey is the most densely populated and third most populated county in the South East region, after Kent and Hampshire. - A clockmaker is an artisan who makes and/or repairs clocks. Since almost all clocks are now factory-made, most modern clockmakers only repair clocks. Modern clockmakers may be employed by jewellers, antique shops, and places devoted strictly to repairing clocks and watches. Clockmakers must be able to read blueprints and instructions for numerous types of clocks and time pieces that vary from antique clocks to modern time pieces in order to fix and make clocks or watches. The trade requires fine motor coordination as clockmakers must frequently work on devices with small gears and fine machinery. - Redruth is a town and civil parish in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The population of Redruth was 14,018 at the 2011 census. In the same year the population of the Camborne-Redruth urban area, which also includes Carn Brea, Illogan and several satellite villages, stood at 55,400 making it the largest conurbation in Cornwall. Redruth lies approximately at the junction of the A393 and A3047 roads, on the route of the old London to Land's End trunk road (now the A30), and is approximately west of Truro, east of St Ives, north east of Penzance and north west of Falmouth. Camborne and Redruth together form the largest urban area in Cornwall and before local government reorganisation were an urban district. - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone. - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.

Article: Every year on my birthday, from the time I turned 12, a white gardenia was delivered to my house. No card came with it. Calls to the flower-shop were not helpful at all. After a while I stopped trying to discover the sender's name and just delighted in the beautiful white flower in soft pink paper. But I never stopped imagining who the giver might be. Some of my happiest moments were spent daydreaming about the sender. My mother encouraged these imaginings. She'd ask me if there was someone for whom I had done special kindness. Perhaps it was the old man across the street whose mail I'd delivered during the winter. As a girl, though, I had more fun imagining that it might be a boy I had run into. One month before my graduation, my father died. I felt so sad that I became completely uninterested in my upcoming graduation dance, and I didn't care if I had a new dress or not. But my mother, in her own sadness, would not let me miss any of those things. She wanted her children to feel loved and lovable. In truth, my mother wanted her children to see themselves much like the gardenia-lovely, strong and perfect with perhaps a bit of mystery .My mother died ten days after I was married. I was 22.

No, Queen Elizabeth II does not have the final veto on the UK leaving the EU. While the Queen is the ceremonial head of the country and has some powers, important decisions like this are made by the government and Parliament. They followed a process called Brexit, which was the UK leaving the EU, and it has already happened without the Queen having to make the final decision. 3. No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase means the same information or question is expressed in different words but means the same thing.

You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Never got it Product review: I never received this item! I had to rate this so I gave it a 1 star, but it wasn't worth that. A:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product, but it should be observed with caution and analyzed in different aspects. Here are some reasons why the review might affect my decision: 1. Delivery Issues: If a customer claims that they never received the item, it might indicate that there are some issues with the delivery process. If there are more similar reviews about delivery problems, this would be a red flag, and I would be less likely to buy the product. However, if this is the only such review, it might be an isolated or rare case. 2. Perception of Overall Ratings: Due to the 1-star rating from this review, the overall rating of the product might get affected, especially if there are not many reviews. This might subconsciously make me lean towards not buying the product, as people generally rely on the average rating of a product while shopping online to make quick decisions. 3. Review Relevance: While analyzing reviews, one important aspect is to consider the relevance of the review to the actual performance or quality of the product. This particular review does not offer any useful information about the product itself - it only discusses the delivery issue which might not even be the fault of the product or the seller. As a result, it would be wise to look for other reviews that discuss the actual performance, quality, and usefulness of the product in question. 4. Seller Reputation: The review might make me question the seller's reputation and their ability to fulfill orders. If there are numerous complaints about the delivery and order fulfillment, it might indicate that the seller is not trustworthy, which would decrease my chances of purchasing the product. 5. Unfair Ratings: It is important to recognize that sometimes customers may give 1-star ratings for issues that may not be directly related to the product itself or its performance. Such reviews might not be a true representation of the product quality, so it is essential to look beyond the rating and reach a more comprehensive understanding of the product through other reviews. In conclusion, while this particular review could initially decrease my chances of purchasing the product, it is necessary to use critical thinking skills while evaluating the reviews on any product. A single review might not provide enough information or an accurate depiction of the product's quality; it is crucial to look at various reviews and feedback to make a well-informed decision. However, if there are multiple reviews indicating delivery issues or poor seller reputation, this would certainly affect my decision to buy the product negatively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Especially he is interested in treating children. One day he saw two children, child M and child N, and found child M is infected with Acute Hepatitis B while child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. Next day he saw two other children, child O and child P. Child O was younger, but child P was older. But I can use this background: Hepatitis B is a contagious virus that affects the liver, infection can last from a few weeks to a serious lifelong illness. Two different types of infection exist for this disease, \\"acute\\" and \\"chronic.\\" Acute Hepatitis B is a short term illness that occurs within 6 months of exposure, Chronic Hepatitis B is long term and happens when the virus remains in the body. The younger the child is, the greater their chance of developing a chronic infection and this risk goes down as the child gets older. Approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection.[3] What is an answer for this question: Which child had less chance of developing a chronic infection, child O or child P? The answer is:","completion":"Child P had less chance of developing a chronic infection. From the background information provided, we know that the risk of developing a chronic Hepatitis B infection decreases as the child gets older. Since Child O is younger than Child P, it implies that Child O naturally has a higher risk of developing a chronic infection than Child P. The statistics mentioned indicate that approximately 90% of infected infants will develop a chronic infection. Although we don't have the specific ages of Child O and Child P, we can infer that as children get older, their chances of developing a chronic infection will be lower than younger children, thus making Child P less likely to develop a chronic infection as compared to Child O. Additionally, it's crucial to understand the difference between acute and chronic Hepatitis B infections. In the initial situation described, Child M is infected with Acute Hepatitis B, while Child N is infected with Chronic Hepatitis B. The acute infection is typically short-term, happening within the first six months after exposure to the virus. In contrast, a chronic infection persists as the virus remains in the body, leading to long-term health issues. In conclusion, based on the age factor and the background information about Hepatitis B infections, Child P, being the older child, has a lower risk of developing a chronic infection in comparison to Child_O."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: who gather together for a birthday party which turns into a philosophical argument? Snaut, Chris, Sartorius, and Hari Answer:","completion":"Title: The Birthday Paradox Step 1: Setting the stage The movie takes place in present-day New York City. All four friends, Snaut, Chris, Sartorius, and Hari, live in the city and are professionals working in different fields. They frequently engage in philosophy-based book club meetings and enjoy discussing different theories, personal beliefs, and contemplations. Step 2: The birthday party Hari, a college professor in philosophy, has invited his closest friends, Snaut, Chris, and Sartorius, to his 40th birthday party. Snaut is a theoretical physicist, Chris is a renowned writer, and Sartorius is a molecular biologist. They all gather at Hari's spacious loft, where the party takes place, filled with fine food, drinks, and music. Step 3: The initial conflict As the night progresses, Chris brings up a controversial topic in philosophy and science: the simulation hypothesis, which argues that our reality is potentially an artificial simulation. Hari, the birthday man himself, expresses his doubts about the theory, while Snaut and Sartorius seem to be more open to the idea, focusing on their respective scientific fields to back up the hypothesis. Step 4: The intensification of the argument The discussion begins to heat up as the characters start presenting their perspectives, supporting or rejecting the simulation hypothesis. As they debate, they touch on consciousness, free will, religion, and morality, ultimately coming forth with their own divergent philosophical views: - Snaut argues from a physics perspective, discussing the quantum realm and its implications about the nature of reality. - Chris analyzes the human experience and emotions through the eyes of a writer. He raises the idea of existentialism, highlighting human's search for meaning in life. - Sartorius reflects on advancements in genetic engineering and artificial intelligence that challenge traditional beliefs about the limits of science and humanity. - Hari counters with critical thinking, skepticism, and the limitations of human understanding. Step 5: Culmination and self-reflection As the philosophical argument reaches its climax, the four friends suddenly find themselves put to the test when a mysterious figure, who has been silently observing their conversation, joins the debate. This fifth person provides a unique and thought-provoking perspective that forces them to question not only the validity of their arguments but also confront their personal beliefs and fears surrounding life, love, and existence. Step 6: Resolution and ending Realizing that their search for an ultimate truth might be an endless endeavor, the friends learn that what truly matters is the freedom to explore, question, and grow together. They embrace their differences and appreciate the value of their friendship beyond the boundaries of any theory or belief. In the end, they raise a toast to Hari's birthday and acknowledge that life's paradoxes make it all the more worth living."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is an article: The fate of a 16-year-old Connecticut girl at the center of a major medical custody dispute is in the hands of a Massachusetts judge, now that Bay State children's advocates have conceded Justina Pelletier should be returned to her family. In a controversial move, Pelletier was placed in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families more than a year ago, after two reputable Boston hospitals sparred in their diagnosis of the girl. When the girl's parents disagreed with a psychiatric diagnosis given by Boston Children's Hospital, the couple said they wanted their daughter returned to her original physician at Tufts Medical Center, who had previously treated Justina for mitochondrial disease, a group of rare genetic disorders affecting cellular energy production. Lou and Linda Pelletier, of West Hartford, Conn., were then accused of \\"medical child abuse,\\" which led to Massachusetts officials taking full custody of the girl. The legal battle that ensued made the case one of the most controversial custody battles in state history. In May, Justina was moved from Massachusetts to a facility in Thompson, Conn. Her parents are now able to visit with their daughter, but still angry that she hasn't been returned home. In a 45-second, videotaped plea, first posted on a Facebook support page Sunday night, Justina is seen sitting in a chair and pleading plaintively with Massachusetts juvenile court Judge Joseph Johnston. \\"All I really want is to be with my family and friends,\\" the girl says, her voice faltering at times. \\"You can do it. You're the one that's judging this. Please let me go home.\\" In what Justina's attorneys are calling a \\"dramatic reversal,\\" the Massachusetts DCF filed a motion agreeing that the teenager should be returned to her family. Alec Loftus, a spokesman for Massachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary John Polanowicz, confirmed to FoxNews.com Wednesday that both parties are in agreement. \\"We are pleased that the family has engaged around the reunification plan and we have filed papers in court to support our shared goal of bringing Justina home,\\" he said in an email. Attorneys representing Justina filed a subsequent motion Tuesday requesting that Johnston expedite a ruling \\"because all parties are in agreement,\\" said Mat Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, which represents the Pelletier family. According to sources close to the case, Johnston issued a June 13 deadline for all paperwork to be filed and indicated a ruling will be made on or before June 20. Staver claims that DCF's concession \\"completely undercuts their argument.\\" \\"She's now getting treatment from Tuft’s medical providers and they’ve agreed to return her to her family,\\" Staver told FoxNews.com. \\"This really cuts out the basis for why they took her in the first place.\\" \\"We're waiting on the judge. At this point, there is no reason to delay,\\" he said. \\"There’s no reason why he can't act immediately.\\" The emotional toll on Justina and her family is one that cannot be measured, Staver said. \\"Every hour she's not back with her family is an hour she can't ever get back,\\" he said. \\"Once she does get home, she’ll have a long road to recovery -- physically, mentally and spiritually.\\" Justina has missed out on two years of education, Staver said, and went from becoming a competitive figure skater to being confined in a wheelchair. Lou Pelletier, meanwhile, said he remains skeptical of the judge, after so many legal hurdles, and will \\"jump for joy once she is released home.\\" \\"Actions speak louder than words,\\" Pelletier said.

A gas or electric stove can be used, with the heat being transferred from the burner to the pan containing the eggs. Therefore, the stove is one of the correct answers. Electricity is another correct answer. For electric stoves, it is the electricity that powers the heating elements, allowing the transfer of heat to the pan for cooking the eggs. Additionally, eggs can also be cooked using electric appliances such as electric griddles, skillets, or even microwave ovens, all of which rely on electricity as their energy source. As for the other options: - Direct energy: This is not applicable, as it's not a specific source or method for cooking eggs. - The egg timer: This is simply a tool to help track cooking time and ensure the eggs are cooked as desired but does not cook the eggs directly. - Fuel cells: These convert chemical energy into electrical energy, but they are not used for cooking eggs. - The spatula: While it's a handy tool used in flipping, stirring, or serving the eggs, it does not cook them. - The fridge: This is an appliance for storing and preserving food at a low temperature, not for cooking. - Oysters: These are a type of shellfish and not relevant to cooking eggs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: For the first time, scientists have found a planet beyond the solar system that not only is the same size as Earth, but has the same proportions of iron and rock, a key step in an ongoing quest to find potentially habitable sister worlds. The planet, known as Kepler-78b, circles a star that is slightly smaller than the sun located in the constellation Cygnus , about 400 light years away. Kepler-78b was discovered last year with NASA's now-idled Kepler space telescope, which detected potential planets as they circled in front of their parent stars, blocking a bit of light. That measurement not only revealed that Kepler-78b was ly small, with a diameter just 20 percent larger than Earth's, but that it was practically orbiting on the surface of its host star. Scientists do not know how the planets ended up so close to their host stars. While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Sympatric Speciation Can divergence occur if no physical barriers are in place to separate individuals who continue to live and reproduce in the same habitat? The answer is yes. The process of speciation within the same space is called sympatric speciation; the prefix “sym” means same, so “sympatric” means “same homeland” in contrast to “allopatric” meaning “other homeland. ” A number of mechanisms for sympatric speciation have been proposed and studied. One form of sympatric speciation can begin with a serious chromosomal error during cell division. In a normal cell division event chromosomes replicate, pair up, and then separate so that each new cell has the same number of chromosomes. However, sometimes the pairs separate and the end cell product has too many or too few individual chromosomes in a condition called aneuploidy (Figure 18.14).

They appear to have the perfect marriage on the surface, but internally there is an undercurrent of fear and suspicion. This can mainly be attributed to Miles' manipulative and controlling nature. Sandra, a talented painter, loses her sense of self and feels trapped within the confines of her marriage to Miles. One fateful day, Sandra discovers hidden evidence that Miles has been cheating on her with their neighbor, Lucy. Shocked and hurt, Sandra realizes she can no longer live a life of deceit and isolation. Act 2: Sandra's plan to regain control over her life begins when her best friend Eliza comes to visit for the weekend. During a therapeutic painting session, Sandra lets her guard down and reveals the truth about her crumbling relationship. Eliza, the epitome of loyalty and courage, convinces Sandra to stand up to Miles and leave him once and for all. As Sandra packs her bags, determined to take back her life, Miles returns home earlier than expected. Sensing something amiss, he confronts Sandra who tells him she is leaving. Miles, unwilling to lose control and unveil his infidelity, resorts to desperate measures. As Sandra tries to leave, he locks the door and pockets the keys, effectively trapping her inside their home. Act 3: With her safety at risk, Sandra and Eliza devise an escape plan. Using their artistic and creative skills, they manage to create multiple copies of the key to the house using clay and other materials at their disposal. They outsmart Miles by switching out these fake keys as he leaves for his job the following day. Miles grows increasingly paranoid and convinced that he is on the verge of losing everything, which fuels his anger and determination to keep Sandra locked up. His behavior becomes more erratic, showcasing his true nature despite his best effort to keep up appearances. Meanwhile, Sandra and Eliza work on unearthing evidence of his adulterous and manipulative behavior that would make their neighbors and friends realize his true nature, including Lucy, who is regretful of her actions and now feels pity for Sandra. Act 4: As Miles continues to spiral out of control, Sandra and Eliza manage to complete their plan against him. They call the police and present the evidence they've collected against Miles. Grappling with undeniable proof, the police arrest Miles, who is charged with domestic abuse and infidelity-related offenses. Feeling betrayed and exposed, Miles' life takes a drastic turn as he loses everything that once gave him a sense of power and control. Meanwhile, Sandra, now a free and stronger woman, decides to use her experience as inspiration for her art. By sharing her story, she inspires others who have been trapped in similar situations to break free from their own chains.

Tweet: i wish i had my phone back!!!! - negative. - positive.","completion":"To accurately determine the sentiment of the given tweet, it is necessary to analyze the content and context of the message. The tweet states, \\"i wish i had my phone back!\\" followed by multiple exclamation marks. From the text, we can derive that the speaker has experienced a loss (their phone) and is expressing a desire to regain the lost item. However, there is no clear indication of whether the sentiment is positive or negative solely based on this text. It could be interpreted in the following ways: 1. Negative: The tweet might be seen as negative in the sense that the speaker is upset or annoyed about not having their phone. They might feel disconnected from their contacts, social media, and other essential aspects of their life, creating a sense of frustration and sadness. 2. Positive: Alternatively, the tweet can be seen as positive if the emphasis is placed on the exclamation marks, which may suggest enthusiasm or excitement about the possibility of recovering their phone. In this interpretation, the speaker is eager to get their phone back and might feel a sense of relief or optimism about this event taking place. However, without any additional context, it is challenging to definitively classify the sentiment of the tweet as either negative or positive. Analyzing the context and any other relevant information can help better understand the emotional tone behind this tweet, such as emojis used or the events that transpired before this tweet.

He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it's essential to analyze each statement and evaluate them based on their correlation. Premise: \\"All you need to do is just wander off the beaten path, beyond the bustling tourist zone.\\" This statement suggests that a person might gain some valuable experience or find hidden gems in life by exploring areas that are not frequently visited by tourists. The emphasis is on going beyond the typical tourist spots and discovering new things. The underlying assumption is that there is value in exploring less popular or less well-known destinations. Hypothesis: \\"There is no point going off the beaten path, there is nothing there.\\" This statement proposes that there is no value or interest in exploring areas beyond the popular tourist zones. It implies that areas that are not considered tourist hotspots have nothing to offer, suggesting that they are devoid of meaningful experiences for travelers. This contradicts the premise, which said there might be some value in exploring lesser-known places. In order to conclude whether the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The premise implies a potential positive outcome from going off the beaten path, while the hypothesis assumes no benefit at all from doing so. These two statements cannot both be true simultaneously, as they contradict each other. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. They have opposing implications, and accepting the premise as true would actually suggest that the hypothesis is false. The premise implies that there might be value in exploring less popular areas and deviating from the traditional tourist pathways, while the hypothesis suggests that there is nothing to gain from such exploration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the... answer the following question: What nurtures frogs, lizards and various insects?

The New York City Police Department receive a call from \\"Simon\\" ordering them that suspended police officer Lt. John McClane be dropped in Harlem wearing a sandwich board that says \\"I hate niggers\\" and threatening to detonate another bomb if they don't comply. They collect McClane and follow Simon's instructions; McClane is saved from a potential attack by young men by Zeus Carver, a nearby shop owner. McClane and Carver escape and return to headquarters, where Simon calls again and threatens to detonate more bombs if McClane and Carver do not follow his instructions. Simon sends the two on a series of children's riddles. He tells them to reach Wall Street station 90 blocks south, within 30 minutes to stop a bomb planted on a Brooklyn-bound 3 train. McClane boards the subway while Carver drives. McClane locates the bomb and throws it off the train, it still detonates, derailing the train and sending it through the station with minimal injuries due to Carver's warnings. As McClane and Carver regroup with the police, they are met by FBI agents, who reveal Simon is Peter Krieg, a former Colonel in the East German People's Army and a mercenary-for-hire. Krieg is after McClane as Krieg's birth name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber whom McClane had previously killed in Nakatomi Towers. Simon calls the police, knowing the FBI is there, that he has planted a bomb in a public school and rigged with a radio detonator triggered by the police band. Simon tells them that he will get McClane and Carver the school's location if they continue to play his game. While McClane and Carver set off on Simon's next task, the police organize all the city's public works to begin searching schools, using 9-1-1 to coordinate activities.

Step 1: Understand the problem The premise of the question is that two different oceans have different numbers of divergent plate boundaries. Step 2: Interpret the data The Arctic Ocean has a single dormant divergent plate, suggesting there is less tectonic activity, while the Pacific Ocean has seven diverging tectonic plates, indicating a lot more tectonic activity. Step 3: Apply knowledge of divergent boundaries At divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move apart from each other. As the plates separate, molten rock (magma) rises from the mantle beneath to fill the gap. This process cools the magma as it comes into contact with the sea water, forming new crust which is usually basalt, a type of rock. Step 4: Make a connection Since more divergent boundaries mean more magma is cooled to form new crust, the Pacific Ocean, with its seven diverging tectonic plates, would experience more cooling of hot molten rock. Step 5: Conclusion Therefore, the ocean that experiences less cooling of hot molten rock is the Arctic Ocean because it has fewer (only one) divergent tectonic plates and it is also dormant."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

If you answer yes to the following questions, you may need counseling: Do you feel as though your partner consistently takes you for granted? Do you feel as though you are often or consistently neglected or ignored by your partner? Does your partner make you feel angry or annoyed on a daily basis? Do you feel jealous of your partner's friends or career? Do you feel sad, hopeless, or \\"stuck\\" in your marriage? Trust is essential for a relationship to succeed. If you and your spouse cannot trust each other, it is time for you to get professional help. Some signs of trust issues include: Monitoring the phone calls, text messages, emails, and social media of your partner. Refusing to allow each other to go out or socialize with friends. Accusing each other of cheating without adequate evidence. Keeping secrets from each other. All couples may go through periods of reduced sexual activity, but these should be temporary. If you or your partner has lost interest in sex for a prolonged period of time, seek advice from a counselor. Try to keep track of how often you have had sex in the last 2-3 months. While every couple's expectation is different, ask yourself if you're satisfied with this pattern. If not, seek counseling. Alternatively, if your spouse seems dissatisfied with your sex life, don't ignore their complaints. Even if you're happy with it, you should address their concerns. Some problems in the bedroom can be solved through communication and compromise. That said, if talking to your spouse about the problem doesn't work, see a counselor.

Q: Background A cluster of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were successively reported in Wuhan, China. We aimed to describe the CT findings across different timepoints throughout the disease course. Methods Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (confirmed by next-generation sequencing or RT-PCR) who were admitted to one of two hospitals in Wuhan and who underwent serial chest CT scans were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were grouped on the basis of the interval between symptom onset and the first CT scan: group 1 (subclinical patients; scans done before symptom onset), group 2 (scans done ≤1 week after symptom onset), group 3 (>1 week to 2 weeks), and group 4 (>2 weeks to 3 weeks). Imaging features and their distribution were analysed and compared across the four groups. Findings 81 patients admitted to hospital between Dec 20, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020, were retrospectively enrolled. The cohort included 42 (52%) men and 39 (48%) women, and the mean age was 49·5 years (SD 11·0).

Do you know what is on top of those poles? Thats right, wires that carry electric current. These wires carry electric current to your home. But what is electric current? Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction. Direct current is what is used in devices like flashlights. Alternating current (AC) flows in two directions. This is the type of current that flows into your home through wires.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It is normal to feel extremely tired following a surgery, especially if you had a major operation or a general anesthetic. Spend time in bed and do only as much as you feel up to doing during these first few days. Pushing yourself too early may be detrimental to your recovery. Avoid any heavy lifting or rigorous exercise during this time. Ask your doctor how long you should rest right after your surgery. This will vary depending on the type of procedure. As a general rule, it is important to get your body moving as much as possible once you start recovering from surgery. Movement will encourage blood flow and strengthen your muscles, making it easier for your body to heal. Ask your doctor how much you are allowed to exercise while you recover and what activities you should avoid. Moderate walking is usually the best exercise to begin with while you are healing. If you spend time recovering in a hospital, asking a nurse or orderly for help walking if necessary. If you are not yet steady on your feet, you may benefit from using a walker or cane to help you keep your balance. High-impact sports, heavy lifting, and rigorous exercise can all cause strain to your body that may delay your healing after surgery. Listen to your doctor's instructions about recovery time and restricted activities. Depending on the surgery you have, you may have to avoid strenuous activity for several weeks or months until your body is fully healed. With major surgeries, your doctor will generally provide you with a specific diet to follow after your operation. Follow any directions or meal plans your doctor gives you very closely while you heal. Eating foods or ingredients that irritate your stomach or cause swelling may hinder your recovery. Processed foods are likely to cause inflammation and stomach irritation. Foods like fatty fish, walnuts, almonds, flax seeds, leafy green vegetables, and turmeric can help reduce inflammation in your body. Many post-surgery diets are high in fiber to prevent constipation, which can cause you to strain and in turn hurt the site of your surgical wound. Lean protein like chicken or fish will help repair body tissue and boost your energy after surgery.

First graders’ favorite book to have Ms. Strongin read out loud is “Knuffle Bunny,” by Mo Willems. 12. First graders claim to hate tattle tales but tattle at every opportunity. 13. First graders are old enough to know the rules, and young enough to turn themselves in for breaking them. 14. First graders love blocks, Legos and marble mazes. 15. First graders love coming to school. 16. First graders fall out of their chairs. 17. To remember to cross their legs when sitting on the floor, first graders sing, “Crisscross apple sauce.” 18. When first graders are supposed to be paying attention, Ms. Strongin says, “Eyes Up,” and they say, “Hands empty.” 19. When it’s time for lunch, Ms. Strongin says “Line order,” and they say, “Straight and quiet.” 20. First graders are taught if they don’t have a tissue, to sneeze into their elbows. 21. Long ago, during a visit to a first-grade class in East Orange, N.J., I asked the Rogers twins, Kendall and Kenneth, to tell me the story of Martin Luther King Jr. ‘'This one time Rosa Parks was sitting in the front of the bus,'’ Kendall said, ‘'and this white lady said, ‘Get up,’ and that bus driver called the police.'’ ‘'And,'’ said Kenneth, ‘'Rosa Parks called up Martin Luther King and said, ‘Get me out of jail, Martin.'” 22. I once visited a church school in Canton, Ohio, where the first graders were called Sparks (Sparks for Jesus) and each week earned bonus Sparky Bucks to be redeemed for toys at the church store. 23. Years ago, I was writing a heartwarming feature about a man who dressed up as Santa Claus and brought gifts to schoolchildren, when a first grader started yelling, “Not real, not real.” 24. When my daughter Annie was in first grade, her goal was to read the entire “Boxcar Children” series (79 books at the time). 25.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion - Question: suppose there is more magma that explodes happens, how will it affect MORE digestion occuring. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"It appears that there might have been a mix-up in the question, as it appears to be unrelated to the digestive system process mentioned. I believe you meant to ask about volcanic activity and potential effects on the ecosystem, or perhaps the effect of perturbations to the digestive process. Assuming the question is about the effect of more volcanic activity on the organisms and their digestive processes, the answer would be as follows: More magma explosions or volcanic eruptions can have both direct and indirect effects on the digestion process of organisms living in the affected area. The impact of these explosions can be described by more, less, or no effect, depending on the specific factors involved. 1. More effect: Volcanic eruptions releasing large amounts of ash can drastically impact the food sources and environment, which in turn will affect the digestive processes of organisms in that area. For example, the ash can contaminate food sources or lower their availability, forcing organisms to adapt their feeding patterns, which can lead to changes in how the digestive system functions. 2. Less effect: In some cases, the volcanic activity might have a minimal effect on the digestive process. For instance, if the explosion isn't severe enough to significantly harm the ecosystem, species might continue their regular feeding habits, and their digestion will be less affected. 3. No effect: For organisms that are not directly impacted by the volcanic activity, or if the eruption doesn't have significant effects on the ecosystem, their digestion process would remain unchanged. For the second part of your question, regarding the supposed perturbation and its influence on the second effect mentioned: I am assuming that the \\"supposed perturbation\\" refers to an increase in volcanic activity and the second effect mentioned is the tongue's involvement in the digestive process. In this case, an increase in volcanic activity may have indirect effects on the tongue's role in digestion. For instance, a decrease in food availability could result in organisms consuming different types of food or altering their feeding patterns. Subsequently, the tongue might have to adapt to these new conditions, such as breaking down different textures, pushing food around to aid in digestion, or even adapting to new flavors.

Write a title: BANJA LUKA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic stepped down on Friday after top peace overseer Paddy Ashdown fired nine officials to punish Bosnia's Serb Republic for failing to arrest war crimes suspects.","completion":"Title: \\"Resignation of Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Amidst War Crimes Pressure: The Impact of Paddy Ashdown's Decision on Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Pursuit for Justice\\" Introduction: The resignation of Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic on Friday marks a pivotal turning point in the volatile history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The decision came after top peace overseer Paddy Ashdown fired nine officials to punish Bosnia's Serb Republic for their failure to arrest war crimes suspects. This move highlights the complex and delicate balance between reconciliation and accountability in the aftermath of the heinous crimes committed during the Bosnian War. This article will delve into the details surrounding Mikerevic's resignation, the reasons behind Ashdown's decision, and the implications that these events may have on the future of Bosnia's Serb Republic and the ongoing efforts to bring justice to the victims of the war. Background: The brutal conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina lasted from 1992 to 1995, involving ethnic cleansing, genocide, and war crimes, which claimed the lives of an estimated 100,000 people and displaced over two million others. The Dayton Agreement in 1995 ended the war, but its aftermath continues to influence the political climate of the region. At the core of this situation lies the responsibility to bring the perpetrators of war crimes to justice, while also fostering reconciliation among the different ethnic groups that had been involved in the conflict. Mikerevic's Resignation and Ashdown's Actions: Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic's decision to step down came as a response to Paddy Ashdown's move to fire nine officials from Bosnia's Serb Republic for failing to arrest war crimes suspects. A prominent figure in Bosnian politics, Mikerevic's resignation demonstrates a clear discontent with the international community's involvement in holding Bosnian institutions accountable for their role in the war. On the other hand, Ashdown's actions underscore the importance of bringing war criminals to justice and exhibit the determination of the international community to not let war crimes go unpunished. Implications for Bosnia's Serb Republic: Mikerevic's resignation and Ashdown's move may lead to a re-assessment of the responsibilities held by Bosnia's Serb Republic in upholding the rule of law and ensuring justice for the victims of war crimes. These events may pressure the region to cooperate more closely with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and other international institutions in the investigation and prosecution of war criminals. The Pursuit for Justice: The resignation of Dragan Mikerevic and the dismissal of nine officials demonstrate a pressing need for all entities within Bosnia and Herzegovina to be held accountable for past war crimes. Bringing war criminals to justice will not only serve to honor the memory of the victims but also contribute to a healing process for a nation plagued by its devastating past. This, in turn, may facilitate the much-needed reconciliation among different ethnic groups in the region. Conclusion: As shocking and impactful as the resignation of Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Dragan Mikerevic may be, it is essential to consider the broader context of promoting justice and reconciliation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. While the extent and consequences of Paddy Ashdown's decision to fire nine officials remain uncertain, it is undeniable that these recent events have re-ignited the conversation surrounding accountability and justice for war crimes committed during the Bosnian War. Looking forward, it is crucial that Bosnia's Serb Republic, along with other entities involved in the conflict, take the necessary steps towards achieving a meaningful and long-lasting peace in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He works at a building construction site managed by MEMAR, the site foreman. Lateef's job is to serve tea and prepare food for the workers with whom he is always quarrelling. The workers come from all parts of Iran, particularly from Iranian Azerbaijan (Azeris are referred as \\"Turks\\" in the film). Some workers are Afghan refugees from war-torn Afghanistan. They have no identity cards and are employed illegally as cheap labour. When the labour inspectors show up, the Afghan workers must hide. As the story starts, an Afghan worker, NAJAF, falls from the building and breaks his leg. He is taken to the hospital. The next day, SOLTAN, another Afghan worker, brings in RAHMAT, Najaf's son, who is around 14 years old, to replace his father. Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds. From then on his attitude changes completely; he becomes protective, helpful and gradually desperately in love with Rahmat. While Rahmat does not express herself verbally at all, over time she seems to respond to this love. During a surprise visit of the labour inspectors, they find themselves face to face with Rahmat. She panics and runs away, as they chase her through the city streets. Lateef runs after them, struggling with the inspectors while Rahmat flees. Lateef is beaten and taken to the police station. Now Memar must pay a fine, comply with the law, and lay off all illegal Afghan workers. Lateef can't bear Rahmat's absence, and decides to locate Soltan to get some news of her. He goes to the village where the Afghans live, walks around, meets an enigmatic cobbler, and ends up in the courtyard of a shrine near a graveyard... Answer:","completion":"In the movie plot set in winter in Teheran, how does Lateef's relationship with Rahmat change after discovering that Rahmat is actually a girl, and how does this revelation impact Lateef's actions and decisions throughout the story?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Check out the base material to know how fast a snowboard is.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: How to Choose the Perfect Snowboard for You Hey kids! Do you want to have lots of fun in the snow? Snowboarding is an awesome way to spend time outside during winter! But first, we need to find the perfect snowboard just for you. Here is a super easy guide to help you choose the best snowboard! 1. Choose a Board Size The first thing you need to do is pick the right size for your snowboard. Just like how you have different sizes of shoes and clothes, snowboards come in different sizes too. A snowboard should be a good fit for you based on your weight, so it can carry you safely on the snow. If you get a snowboard that’s too small or too big for you, it might be difficult to control and not as much fun. 2. Choose the Right Board Width for Your Feet Next, we need to make sure the snowboard is just the right width for your feet. You don't want your toes hanging off the side when you're standing on it because that can make it tricky to balance and ride. Pick a snowboard that's wide enough to keep your toes and heels comfy, but not too wide that it feels like you're riding on a big, clunky sled. Your mommy or daddy, or a grown-up at the store, can help you find the perfect snowboard width for your feet. 3. Check Out the Base Material to Know How Fast a Snowboard is Lastly, let's look at what the bottom of the snowboard is made of. This is important because it can tell us how fast the snowboard can go on the snow. Some snowboards have a really smooth bottom, kind of like ice, which will make them super fast. Other snowboards have a more textured bottom, which can give you more control, but might be a little slower. Think about how fast you want to go and what you feel most comfortable with when choosing your snowboard's base material. That's it! Now you know how to choose the perfect snowboard for you. Remember, it's always more fun and safe to ride with friends or family, so make sure to bring them along. Put on your warm clothes and safety gear, and get ready to slide, jump, and laugh in the snow. Happy snowboarding!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. and the situation: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest.

A friend asked me to answer this question: Who tries to have a natural abortion with parsley?, using the article: Kate is a bike-maintenance instructor who realized she is no longer in love with her boyfriend of five years, Ollie. Kate and Ollie have been together since high school. Kate finds out she is pregnant, which complicates the whole situation because she is not sure if she truly does want to breakup with Ollie or not. However, Kate does not want to have a baby, but does not want to wait weeks for a clinical abortion, so her herbalist friend, Chloe tells her that being on a parsley diet can make you have a natural abortion. Kate then goes on to constantly eat parsley and at one point in the film, even bathe in parsley. Ollie is \\"the king of contraception\\", where he counsels people on contraception for his job. Kate's friends see Kate and Ollie's relationship as the greatest relationship there could ever be and they envy her for it, even her lesbian friend thinks she would be crazy to leave him. Kate decides it is for the best not to tell Ollie about the pregnancy, despite her friends telling her she should. The film suggests that Kate may have had an affair with her \\"slow student\\" and may be the real reason why she wants an abortion. However, we find out that Ollie purposely poked holes in the condom, attempting to save their relationship together by having a child. Kate ultimately decides that breaking up with Ollie and moving on is for the best. Kate and Ollie both agree to meet at the lake in ten years, which is the spot the two of them first fell in love in the first place., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The person who attempts to have a natural abortion with parsley, according to the narrative provided, is Kate. Kate is a bike-maintenance instructor who finds herself in a complex emotional dilemma. She has discovered that she is no longer in love with her long-term boyfriend, Ollie, who she has dated since high school. This already complicated situation is further exacerbated when Kate finds out she is pregnant. Given her conflicted feelings about Ollie and the uncertainty about her future with him, Kate decides that she doesn't want to have the baby. She also doesn't want to wait a requisite amount of time for a clinical abortion procedure. At this point, her friend Chloe, a herbalist, suggests a peculiar solution to Kate's pregnancy dilemma. Chloe tells Kate that consuming large amounts of parsley, known for its high vitamin C and volatile oil apiol, can induce a natural abortion. This is a controversial and potentially hazardous approach, but Kate finds herself desperate enough to try it. She starts consuming extensive amounts of parsley, and at one point, she even bathes in it in an attempt to expedite the process. Throughout this period, Kate decides to keep her pregnancy and her attempts to terminate it a secret from Ollie, despite her friends advising her to the contrary. The film insinuates that Kate's decision to seek an abortion might be influenced by a potential affair she had with a 'slow student'; however, this is not confirmed. Meanwhile, we discover that Ollie, who ironically works as a contraception counselor, has been deliberately sabotaging their birth control to get Kate pregnant. He hopes that having a child together might save their crumbling relationship. Despite these manipulative tactics, Kate remains resolute in her decision to abort the pregnancy and ends her relationship with Ollie. Ultimately, they agree to meet ten years later at the lake where they first fell in love, thus parting on a hopeful yet melancholic note. So, in conclusion, Kate is the character who attempts to use parsley as a means to induce a natural abortion, showcasing the complexities of their relationship and her determination to break free from it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And now, the issue's gone political with increasingly vocal talk on Capitol Hill and in midterm campaigns calling for a travel ban to keep the disease from spreading in the U.S. Let's sort through the muck and get to the facts:. What's all this talk about a travel ban to deal with the Ebola outbreak? Some Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats are calling for a travel ban on people from the West African countries most affected by the disease. In Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, more than 4,400 people have died of the disease and one person has died of the disease in the U.S. That patient was diagnosed and ultimately died at a Texas hospital and now Gov. Rick Perry is joining calls for a travel ban after two nurses at the hospital contracted the disease. \\"Air travel is, in fact, how this disease crosses borders and it's certainly how it got to Texas in the first place,\\" Perry said. \\"I believe it is the right policy to ban air travel from countries that have been hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak.\\" Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said Saturday that such a travel ban \\"makes sense.\\" His state is on high alert after Amber Vinson, the second Dallas nurse to fall ill, flew to Cleveland and spent four days there after she had contracted the virus. But health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization aren't recommending a travel ban, and CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden has even said the ban could hurt efforts to prevent an outbreak in the United States. Has the U.S. ever enforced that kind of a blanket travel ban? Not really. The U.S. has not banned people from a certain country from coming to the U.S. because of an epidemic. But President Ronald Reagan in 1987 did ban anyone infected with HIV/AIDS from entering in the United States. And for more than 20 years, that was U.S. government policy until President Barack Obama struck it down in 2009. That travel ban came at a time when AIDS was heavily stigmatized in the United States and amid misinformation and some public fear that the disease could spread through casual contact. Anyway, there's not much evidence to suggest that travel ban was successfully enforced or effective. Today, more than 1.1 million people are HIV positive. But remember, Ebola is nothing like AIDS according to Sen. (and Dr.) Rand Paul. Wait, just checking, Ebola can't be spread through the air right? No. No, no, no. The Ebola virus is only spread through contact with the bodily fluids of a person who has started showing symptoms of the disease. And while some have stoked fears that the disease could go airborne, the World Health Organization and other experts have said the chances that could happen are near to nil and are unaware of a virus that has ever mutated in that way. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? What about epidemics like SARS and swine flu that have infected and killed way more people than Ebola? Why weren't there travel bans for those outbreaks? Nope. No travel bans for those diseases. Swine flu, also known as H1N1 flu, killed more than 284,000 people between 2009 and 2010 according to the CDC -- of which about 12,000 Americans. The WHO did not recommend a travel ban then either. And the United States never banned travel from China, the epicenter of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which tallied roughly the same number of cases -- over 8,000 -- in the same seven-month period as the Ebola epidemic. In fact, U.S. airports never implemented SARS passenger screenings at airports at a time when many other countries did. So why are politicians so certain a travel ban is the right way to go here? Simply put, a lot of members of Congress just want to keep the disease out of the United States and prevent any more cases from spring up at home. And they believe the best way to do that is to bar anyone who's been in West Africa recently -- or who has a passport from one of those countries. U.S. health officials grilled on Ebola at congressional hearing. Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms. And Rep. Fred Upton said Ebola \\"needs to be solved in Africa, but until it is we should not be allowing these folks in. Period.\\" OK, that sounds like it makes sense. Why are health experts saying the ban's a bad idea? The CDC's Frieden gets why that's the knee-jerk reaction to such a deadly disease. But a ban might actually make things worse, he said, because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to West Africa. And without that crucial information, Frieden said people infected with Ebola could slip into the United States without the CDC being able to track and monitor them for symptoms. But aren't more than two dozen African countries now enforcing some kind of travel ban? Yes. A few of the neighboring West African countries have actually sealed their borders altogether while many other countries on the continent are banning travel to and from those West African countries. But it's not clear how effective those bans are at keeping West Africans out in a region known for especially porous borders. \\"Even when governments restrict travel and trade, people in affected countries still find a way to move and it is even harder to track them systematically,\\" Frieden said last week. So you're saying it probably wouldn't work? Nope. At least not according to health officials. In fact, there are no direct flights to the United States from either Libera, Sierra Leone or Guinea, the three most affected countries. There are direct flights from Nigeria, which has dealt with 20 cases, but that country has been much more effective in containing the outbreak. Latest Ebola developments. How else could a travel ban hurt? The ban would especially hurt efforts in West Africa to contain the disease, where foreign health care workers have been central to the fight against the epidemic. And if American health workers are afraid they can't return to the United States, they might decide not to go at all. Preventing the disease from spreading further in West Africa is crucial to keep Ebola from continuing to spread.

I spent 4 hours waiting and when it was finally done I was charged 111.00 and told my service engine light was on (was not when i gave it running to service writer who I watched drive it to the smog machine) After the 4 hour waiting for the smog, I was told by the service writer, they smogged and it failed due to engine light on. let me explain, I have been in the automotive industry here locally for over 15 years. I know if the check engine light is on it will not pass smog, so i would have never wasted my money in the first place! After I finished trying to flip the dealership over (with anger because of the lie i had to pay for) a lot porter comes up to me and asked me for a date, seriously??? My failed smog and 4 hours of wasted time cost me 111.00 and the time is not replaceable. I then had to go to a mechanic and get it fixed (he had unplugged a cord).

In the United Kingdom, the song sold 710,000 copies and stayed at number one for 3 weeks. - Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), known mononymously as Beck, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer and multi-instrumentalist. He is mostly known for his musical composition, as well as a palette of sonic genres. - Midnite Vultures is the fourth official studio album and seventh overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, released in November 1999 by DGC Records. While similar to most of Beck's previous albums in its exploration of widely varying musical styles, \\"Midnite Vultures\\" didn't achieve the same blockbuster success as his breakthrough, \\"Odelay\\", though it was still critically and commercially well received. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - A soundtrack, also written sound track, can be recorded music accompanying and synchronized to the images of a motion picture, book, television program or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film or TV show; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronized recorded sound. - Paul's Boutique is the second studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on July 25, 1989, on Capitol Records. Featuring production by the Dust Brothers, the album was recorded in Matt Dike's apartment and the Record Plant in Los Angeles from 1988 to 1989, and mixed at the Record Plant. Subsequent remixes were done at the Manhattan-based Record Plant Studios. The album is noted for being almost completely composed of samples, excluding the group's vocal output. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - The Beastie Boys were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1980. For the majority of their career, the group consisted of Michael \\"Mike D\\" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam \\"MCA\\" Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam \\"Ad-Rock\\" Horovitz (vocals, guitar). - Odelay is the second official studio album and fifth overall by American alternative rock artist Beck, originally released on June 18, 1996, by DGC Records. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s.

Plot title: Dragonslayer Movie plot: A sixth-century post-Roman kingdom called Urland[2] is being terrorized by a 400-year-old dragon named Vermithrax Pejorative.[2] To appease the dragon, King Casiodorus (Peter Eyre) offers it virgin girls selected by lottery twice a year. An expedition led by a young man called Valerian (Clarke) seeks the last sorcerer, Ulrich of Craggenmoor (Richardson), for help. A brutish soldier from Urland named Tyrian (Hallam), who has followed the expedition, intimidates the wizard. Ulrich invites Tyrian to stab him to prove his magical powers. Tyrian does so and Ulrich dies instantly, to the horror of his young apprentice Galen Bradwarden (MacNicol) and his elderly servant Hodge (Sydney Bromley). Hodge cremates Ulrich's body and places the ashes in a leather pouch, informing Galen that Ulrich wanted his ashes spread over a lake of burning water. Galen inherits the wizard's magical amulet, and takes it upon himself to journey to Urland. On the way, he discovers Valerian is really a young woman, who disguised herself to avoid being selected in the lottery. In an effort to discourage the expedition, Tyrian kills Hodge; before dying, he hands Galen the pouch and dies with the words \\"Burning water...\\" on his lips. Arriving in Urland, Galen inspects the dragon's lair and attempts to seal its entrance by causing rocks to fall from the cliff. Tyrian apprehends Galen and takes him to the court of King Casiodorus. King Casiodorus guesses that Galen is not a real wizard and complains that his attack may have angered the dragon instead of killing it, as his own brother and predecessor once did. The king confiscates the amulet and imprisons Galen. His daughter Elspeth (Chloe Salaman) comes to taunt Galen, but is shocked when he informs her of rumours that the lottery is rigged to exclude her name and those who are rich enough to pay to have their children' names removed. Casiodorus is unable to lie convincingly when she confronts him regarding this. Meanwhile, the dragon frees itself from its prison and causes an earthquake. Galen... My question: What is Urland?

Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton, FBA (15 January 1914 - 26 January 2003), was a British historian of early modern Britain and Nazi Germany. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford. Trevor-Roper was made a life peer in 1979 on the recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, choosing the title Baron Dacre of Glanton. Trevor-Roper was a polemicist and essayist on a wide range of historical topics, but particularly England in the 16th and 17th centuries and Nazi Germany. In 1980 at the age of 67, he became Master of Peterhouse, the oldest and smallest college in the University of Cambridge. His election, which surprised his friends, was engineered by a group of Fellows led by Maurice Cowling, then the leading Peterhouse historian. The Fellows chose him because Cowling's reactionary clique thought he would be an arch-conservative who would oppose the admission of women. In the event, Trevor-Roper feuded constantly with Cowling and his allies, while launching a series of administrative reforms. Women were admitted in 1983 at his urging. The British journalist Neal Ascherson summarised the quarrel between Cowling and Trevor-Roper as: Lord Dacre, far from being a romantic Tory ultra, turned out to be an anti-clerical Whig with a preference for free speech over superstition. He did not find it normal that fellows should wear mourning on the anniversary of General Franco's death, attend parties in SS uniform or insult black and Jewish guests at high table. For the next seven years, Trevor-Roper battled to suppress the insurgency of the Cowling clique (\\"a strong mind trapped in its own glutinous frustrations\\"), and to bring the college back to a condition in which students might actually want to go there. Neither side won this struggle, which soon became a campaign to drive Trevor-Roper out of the college by grotesque rudeness and insubordination. In a review of Adam Sisman's 2010 biography of Trevor-Roper, the Economist wrote that picture of Peterhouse in the 1980s was \\"startling\\", stating the college had become under Cowling's influence a sort of right-wing \\"lunatic asylum\\", who were determined to sabotage Trevor-Roper's reforms. In 1987 he retired complaining of \\"seven wasted years.\\"Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What did he accomplish as Master of Peterhouse?","completion":"As Master of Peterhouse, Hugh Redwald Trevor-Roper accomplished the introduction of administrative reforms as well as the admittance of women to the college.

In comparison to the coffee shop, the library is specifically designed to cater to the needs of individuals looking for a space to read, study, and engage in research. As a result, it purposefully maintains a quiet atmosphere to enable patrons to concentrate on their tasks without disturbance. In contrast, coffee shops often serve as social hubs for people to meet, converse, and relax. The combined noise from the bustling environment, patrons' chatter, and background music can make concentrating on academic work significantly more challenging. Moreover, the constant ebb and flow of customers, coupled with the occasional whirring and grinding from the espresso machines, can be distracting for someone like Betty who needs a serene setting to immerse herself in her exam preparation. Additionally, libraries offer numerous resources, such as books, scholarly articles, and computers with internet access, all of which can prove incredibly useful for a student like Betty. The facility's knowledgeable staff is readily available to provide assistance in locating and utilizing these materials, thus streamlining the study process. Additionally, libraries often have private study rooms or carrels that allow for an even more secluded and focused environment. Furthermore, in the library, there is a better chance of Betty encountering fellow students preparing for the same exam or focusing on their studies. This atmosphere of shared academic engagement can motivate her to work harder and maintain concentration throughout her study session. Alternatively, her peers may even offer insight or assistance with any challenges she encounters, fostering a collaborative learning environment. On the other hand, coffee shops are primarily structured for patrons to enjoy their beverages and food items. Consequently, seating arrangements and table space might not be as comfortable or suitable for an extended study session. Additionally, the availability of tables and seats is not guaranteed during busy hours, which could negatively affect her study session. In conclusion, Betty chose to study in the library instead of the coffee shop because the library is quieter, offering her a more favorable setting for her exam preparation. The calm and focused ambiance, along with access to various resources and potential learning collaborations, provide the optimal environment for her to excel in her studies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the background: Because of human activities, there is more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today than in the past hundreds of thousands of years. Burning fossil fuels and has released great quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Cutting forests and clearing land has also increased carbon dioxide into the atmosphere because these activities reduce the number of autotrophic organisms that use up carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. In addition, clearing often involves burning, which releases carbon dioxide that was previously stored in autotrophs. and the situation: John has been hearing about climate change for last couple of years. He wants to understand the science behind climate change. For that, he picked up two eras in earth's history, era A and era B. Era A was hundred thousand years ago, and era B is in the present day. He now wants to compare these to eras to understand the change in climate better. Answer the following question: Would era A have more or less carbon dioxide in the air than era B? Answer:","completion":"Era B, which is the present day, would have more carbon dioxide in the air than Era A, which was hundred thousand years ago. This is due to the considerable increase in human activities that contribute to the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These activities include burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) and deforestation. Burning fossil fuels is one of the primary sources of increased carbon dioxide. When we burn these fuels to produce energy (for vehicles, electricity, heating, etc.), carbon dioxide is released. This has accelerated especially since the Industrial Revolution, contributing significantly to the rise of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Deforestation and land clearing are other significant sources of increased carbon dioxide. Trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide as part of photosynthesis, thus reducing its amount in the atmosphere. When forests are cut down and lands are cleared (for agriculture, urbanization, etc.), not only is this carbon-absorbing capacity lost, but if the wood is burned or even left to decompose, the carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. So, due to these human activities, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere during Era B is substantially higher than what it would have been in Era A. This increasing concentration of carbon dioxide is one of the main factors contributing to the current climate change, as carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere."},{"prompt":"Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Thai that retains the same meaning through the translation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Process: - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a winter storm covers a mountain with blizzard snow happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"The winter storm and subsequent snow accumulation on a mountain can have indirect effects on smaller volcanic eruptions, although these effects are generally limited when compared to the more powerful forces driving the eruption process. The primary impact snow can have on smaller eruptions involves the interaction between the snow and the erupting magma. When the volcanic magma makes contact with the Snow-covered mountain, the snow will quickly melt and vaporize due to the extreme heat. This can lead to several consequences: 1. Increased explosive eruptions: If the snow or ice melts rapidly and mixes with the erupting magma, it can create a more explosive eruption due to the rapid production of steam. This is known as a phreatomagmatic eruption and is generally more violent than a solely magma-driven eruption. 2. Lahars and debris flows: The rapid melting of snow due to contact with the magma can generate large volumes of meltwater. This water can mix with loose volcanic material, like ash and rock debris, to form lahars or volcanic mudflows. These can travel down the slopes of the volcano at high speeds, causing destruction and posing a significant hazard to the surrounding area. 3. Insulation of lava flows: The snow can also provide some insulation for lava flows, slowing down their cooling process. As a result, the lava may travel further down the slopes of the mountain than it would otherwise. 4. Increased surface water: Snowmelt may increase the amount of water in nearby streams and rivers. This can impact the local ecosystem and may contribute to landslides and flooding, particularly in combination with volcanic debris. It is essential to note that these effects are secondary to the main driving forces behind volcanic eruptions, such as the pressure from the rising magma and the composition of magma. The winter storm and snow accumulation may influence the outcomes of smaller eruptions in certain cases, but they are not the primary causes of such eruptions or alteration in their size."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We can do that by adding 204*o to both sides of the equation: (-341*o) + (204*o) = (-204*o) - 137 + (204*o) This simplifies to: -137*o = -137 Now, let's solve for o.

When Niko is discovered missing, Julius chooses to look for Niko as he can search without leaving a trail as fresh snow is falling. Once he finds him, Julius cannot convince Niko to return to the herd and reluctantly joins him in the search for Santa's secret location. Meanwhile, Essie, a lost pet poodle, stumbles upon the wolf pack and is about to be eaten, but suggests to Black Wolf the idea of killing Santa's Flying Forces reindeer. Essie is considered Black Wolf's good luck charm for this idea and is spared, but is also forced to join the pack on this grim plan. Niko and Julius discover Wilma, a weasel, stuck in a small tree branch and rescue her.

She was officially broke. She didn't have enough money to get on the subway, but she looked rich. She was a television producer, earned 900 a week, and had a closetful of designer labels like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. But she also had a 20,221.40 credit card bill and an empty bank account. Karyn decided that it was time for a change. She built a website and simply asked people to help her out by sending her a dollar or two. On the site, Karyn honestly explained her situation. \\"If 20,000 people gave me just 1, I'd be home free.\\" Amazingly, it worked. Her website was visited by more than a million people. Although most donors just gave a few dollars, one generous donor sent 1,000. She was on TV and in newspapers and magazines. She was offered a book deal and a movie contract. And of course, she was able to pay off her credit card debt. She also sold her designer clothes on eBay.

John wanted to install a shelf for his cactus but the","completion":"wall he initially selected wasn't suitable, so he had to come up with an alternative plan to ensure the shelf was properly and securely mounted while also complementing the aesthetics of his room. To begin with, John researched different types of shelves that could support the weight of the cactus and its pot. He considered floating shelves, bracket shelves, and corner shelves as potential options, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of each design. Floating shelves offered a minimalist and clean look, but might not be able to hold the weight of the cactus; bracket shelves were sturdy and reliable, but their visible support brackets might not match his desired aesthetic; and corner shelves made good use of space, but were somewhat limiting in terms of positioning. After selecting a sturdy yet visually appealing bracket shelf, John carefully considered the alternative wall options in his room. He used a stud finder to locate the wooden studs behind the drywall, noting their positions on the wall to determine the best spot for the shelf. He also assessed the amount of sunlight each wall received, as the cactus would need ample natural light to thrive. John eventually chose a wall with both sufficient structural support and sufficient sunlight exposure. Before installing the shelf, he gathered all the necessary tools and materials, including a level, a power drill, wall anchors, screws, and the shelf brackets. He also took measurements to determine the exact height and position for the shelf, accounting for the height of the cactus and ensuring that it would be easily accessible for watering and care. Following the manufacturer's instructions for the shelf brackets, John marked the locations for the pilot holes and drilled them into the wall, using wall anchors as needed to provide extra stability for the shelf. He then attached the brackets to the wall using screws, making sure they were level and secure. Once the brackets were firmly in place, John placed the shelf on top and fastened it to the brackets as directed. After confirming that the shelf was level and securely mounted, John proceeded to add some personal touches. He placed the cactus in a stylish ceramic pot and set it atop a decorative coaster to protect the shelf from potential water damage. In addition, he arranged a few other small plants and trinkets around the cactus, creating a visually appealing and cohesive display. Finally, John stood back to admire his handiwork. His carefully planned and installed shelf not only provided the necessary support for the cactus but also enhanced the overall aesthetic of his room.

Given the question: Information: - Web television (also web series) is original television content produced for broadcast via the World Wide Web. (The phrase \\"web television\\" is also sometimes used to refer to Internet television in general, which includes Internet-transmission of programs produced for both online and traditional terrestrial, cable, or satellite broadcast.) - Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or, in the 2010s, light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. Analog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation. - Vimeo is a global video-sharing website in which users can upload, share and view videos. It was the first video sharing site to support high-definition video (started in October 2007). Vimeo was founded in November 2004 by Jake Lodwick and Zach Klein. - A voicemail system (also known as voice message or voice bank) is a computer-based system that allows users and subscribers to exchange personal voice messages; to select and deliver voice information; and to process transactions relating to individuals, organizations, products and services, using an ordinary telephone. The term is also used more broadly to denote any system of conveying a stored telecommunications voice messages, including using an answering machine. Most cell phone services offer voice-mail as a basic feature; many corporate PBXs include versatile internal voice-messaging services, and *98 Vertical service code subscription is available to most individual and small business land line subscribers. - Voice message refers to a message that could be sent to a destination using voice media. Voice itself could be 'packaged' and sent through the IP backbone so that it reaches its marked 'address'. In a technical sense, the process of sending 'voice packets' is a semi passive way of communication. However, given the speed at which it could be delivered can make the communication sound seamless. - A portmanteau (; plural \\"portmanteaus\\" or \\"portmanteaux\\" ) or portmanteau word is a linguistic blend of words, in which parts of multiple words or their phones (sounds) are combined into a new word. as in \\"smog\\", coined by blending \\"smoke\\" and \\"fog\\", or \\"popportunity\\", from \\"popping\\" and \\"opportunity\\", or \\"motel\\", from \\"motor\\" and \\"hotel\\". In linguistics, a portmanteau is defined as a single morph that represents two or more morphemes. - A web series is a series of scripted or non-scripted videos, generally in episodic form, released on the Internet and part of the web television medium, which first emerged in the late 1990s and become more prominent in the early 2000s (decade). A single instance of a web series program can be called an episode or \\"webisode\\", however the latter term is not often used. In general, web series can be watched on a range of platforms, including desktop, laptop, tablets and smartphones. They can also be watched on television. - A webisode is an episode of a series that is distributed as web television. It is available as either for download or in streaming, as opposed to first airing on broadcast or cable television. The format can be used as a preview, a promotion, as part of a collection of shorts, or a commercial. A webisode may or may not have been broadcast on TV. What defines it is its online distribution on the web, or through video-sharing web sites such as Vimeo or YouTube. While there is no set standard for length, most webisodes are relatively short, ranging from 315 minutes in length. It is a single web episode, but collectively is part of a web series, a form called web television that characteristically features a dramatic, serial storyline, where the primary method of viewership is streaming online over the Internet. The term \\"webisode\\" (a portmanteau formed from the words 'web' and 'episode') was first introduced in the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary in 2009. - A vertical service code (VSC) is a special code dialed prior to (or instead of) a telephone number that engages some type of special telephone service or feature. Typically preceded with an asterisk, or * (star), key on the touch tone keypad and colloquially referred to as star codes, most are two digits in length; as more services are developed, those that use \\"2\\" or \\"3\\" as the first digit are sometimes three digits in length. - The answering machine, answerphone or message machine, also known as the telephone answering machine (or TAM) in the UK and some Commonwealth countries, ansaphone or ansafone (from a trade name), or telephone answering device (TAD), is used for answering telephones and recording callers' messages. - Voicemail was an online television show that can be seen through the ABC.com Full Episode Player . Each short webisode features Mike , played by Ezra Godden , with his voicemail messages played in the background . As each message plays they help explain Mike 's actions . In the episode entitled \`\` Supplies '' , for example , Mike is seen making a giant ball out of masking tape while a series of voicemails from his boss asking him where the tape is going . - YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. The service was created by three former PayPal employeesChad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karimin February 2005. In November 2006, it was bought by Google for US1.65 billion.

And I was wondering What will Cameron want to do next? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is difficult to definitively predict what Cameron will want to do next after seeing Casey this morning. However, I can generate a detailed response and suggest some possibilities based on general assumptions and logical reasoning. First, let's consider the relationship between Cameron and Casey. Are they friends, acquaintances, colleagues, or do they share another type of relationship? The nature of their relationship could greatly influence Cameron's next actions. Below are various scenarios that could play out, based on different relationship dynamics: 1. If Cameron and Casey are friends, it is possible that Cameron would want to make plans to spend more time together. This could include arranging a get-together with other friends, going to a movie or restaurant, or participating in a shared hobby or activity. 2. If Cameron and Casey are colleagues, there is a chance that Cameron might need to discuss work-related matters with Casey. This could involve collaborating on a project, seeking advice from Casey regarding a work issue, or discussing the progress of a team effort. 3. If Cameron and Casey have a more distant relationship, such as being acquaintances or distant relatives, Cameron may simply want to catch up on recent events in each others' lives. They could exchange updates on their families, careers, or experiences since they last saw each other. 4. If Cameron saw Casey in the context of a professional or service environment, such as a store or service provider, Cameron's next actions could be related to conducting business. This could include making a purchase, placing an order, or following up on a service request. 5. If Cameron and Casey have a romantic interest in each other, Cameron might want to take the opportunity to express his feelings or intentions towards Casey. This could involve setting up a date, exchanging messages, or discussing their shared interests in a more personal context. 6. If the meeting between Cameron and Casey was merely a coincidence, it is possible that Cameron's next actions may not be directly related to Casey at all. Instead, Cameron might continue with his usual routine and respond to the encounter with a brief acknowledgment, such as sending a text message or making a phone call to say that it was nice to see Casey. In summary, predicting what Cameron wants to do next after seeing Casey this morning is reliant upon the context and nature of their relationship, as well as the specific circumstances surrounding the encounter. There are numerous plausible scenarios that could play out, ranging from making further plans together to Cameron continuing with his day independently after acknowledging the meeting. Without more information, it is challenging to accurately determine Cameron's potential actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Raed Hijazi\\" correctly answer the question \\"President Clinton along with which top aid explore options regarding Bin Laden, including expulsion from Afghanistan and execution?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"Raed Hijazi\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"President Clinton along with which top aide explore options regarding Bin Laden, including expulsion from Afghanistan and execution?\\" The correct response should be \\"Samuel 'Sandy' Berger,\\" who was President Clinton's national security advisor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: It rewrites the rules of global trade, established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, in 1947, and modified in multiple rounds of negotiations since then. Sentence: GATT was formed in 1947.","completion":"After thoroughly examining the provided text, it can be determined that the sentence \\"GATT was formed in 1947\\" is indeed true. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was established in 1947 as an international trade organization aimed at promoting multilateral trade by reducing tariffs and other trade barriers among its member countries. GATT functioned as a significant part of the global trading system and provided a framework for trade negotiations among its members. The text states that GATT established the rules of global trade in 1947. Since its formation, GATT has undergone multiple rounds of negotiations aimed at further liberalizing international trade, updating rules, and addressing new trade-related issues. This process has led to the modification of the original rules set by GATT in 1947, as mentioned in the text. In conclusion, the statement \\"GATT was formed in 1947\\" is accurate because it highlights the key historical background of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, emphasizing its primary role in shaping the global trading system since its inception."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Noel Coward,a witty and urbane man,was friends with Louis Mountbatten.Mr Coward,a long-time admirer of all things naval,was commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of Mountbatten's ship.In a peculiarly British way it was considered that a film about the Royal Navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda.It was also considered a good idea to have Mr Coward play the part of the ship's captain.Amang the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship,the ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated \\"point\\" songs does not come very high up the list at Admiralty House,or at least one would hope not.A captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike. Mr Coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at Drury Lane and Binkie Beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame,mould and direct a ship's crew in wartime must be brought into question.He folds himself languorously around the bridge,patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers,he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home. Much is made of the \\"warship as a microcosm of British Society\\"theme,and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys,canny northerners etc.without whom no war can be fought.They spend most of their time on board smoking,moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up. Never mind,there's plenty more where they came from.Once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking,moaning about Lord Haw Haw and getting blown up .By contrast Mr Coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up.He,his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames.That nice young master Johnny Mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships Mr Coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master.He marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek,presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion. So yes,we do have a microcosm of British society here,but perhaps not in the way the makers of \\"In which we serve\\" intended. At the end Mr Coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past him,\\"Goodbye Edwards,it was a privilege to sail with you\\"he enunciates as if he was reciting \\"How now brown cow\\". It may have been David Lean's feature debut,but the hand of Noel Coward looms large right across this picture.He was a funny and clever man,better suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry song.He had a talent to amuse,no doubt,but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: These factors will be based on the type of fish that you want to catch. Short rods provide power for fish that give more fight while longer rods cast further. The power of a rod is how much weight in can lift, from light to extra heavy. Rods can also be chosen based on the weight of the lure or the pound-test line that they are designed to be paired with. Choose a graphite rod if you want a stiff yet sensitive experience and a fiberglass rod for a tough and powerful one. Reels are classified as high or low speed where the latter is used when needing more power to fight large fish. Some reels allow you to push a button to switch between high and low speed. Spinning rod and reels work well with top-water poppers and high-speed plugs. Use your dominant hand to hold the rod as you use your other hand to crank the handle. Make sure you change the handle of your rod depending on which is your dominant hand. Spool the line by laying the rod on the floor and ensure that the line is going onto the reel at the same direction that the line is leaving the spool. Pinch the line and crank the reel handle a dozen times. With a slack line, drop the tip of the rod to check if the line starts to twist and spin. If it does, you have spooled the line in the wrong direction. Flip the spool over and continue in the right direction as you fill the reel. These rods work best when bottom fishing, jigging, long casting, or when using big baits. Use an open-face reel for casing or jigging to let out and retrieve the line quickly. Use a closed face reel when using lighter lures and baits. Make sure to use your thumb to control the speed of the spool and keep it slow. Baitcasting rods easily get tangled because the spool turns faster than the line as it leaves the rod. If the tangle isn’t too bad you may be able to untangle it by pulling more line off the reel. However, most baitcasting reel have either a centrifugal, magnetic, or electronic cast control to keep your line from getting tangled. Saltwater trolling rods carry a lot of line and their large bodies allow them to take extreme pressure for fighting large fish. These rods are shorter and stronger than casting rods. They may also come with a notched butt for a fighting belt or chair. Rods that are longer with a short butt are meant for use with a fighting belt or chair. Pair the rod with an appropriate line-test where a 20 pound rod and line combo works for sailfish, dolphin and marlin. Use 130 pound rod and line combo for billfish and bluefin tuna. These rods work best for either hovering over a target or to retrieve your line at high speeds. Use specialized tackle to work your lure at the correct speed, either very quickly or slowly depending on the fish. Use vertical jigging with high-speed rods and metal lures for fast retrieval. In contrast, use rubber jigs to hover over the target or for slow, deliberate retrieval. Summary:","completion":"This article is about choosing the right fishing rod, reel, and technique for different types of fish, considering factors like power, length, material, and speed, and also explaining how to spool the line and avoid tangles."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: I can use this background: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off. Now, I have a new situation: Jake and his brother Jordan both have to go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled. Jake is allergic to the anesthetic unfortunately, so he has to have the procedure done without it. Jordan isn't allergic, so he is able to get his tooth pulled after an anesthetic is injected. Answer this question please: Who will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes? Answer:","completion":"Jake will not experience a disruption of ion movement in their cell membranes. Since he is allergic to the anesthetic, he cannot receive the anesthetic injection that would affect the membrane structure and ion movement, thus he undergoes the tooth extraction without any anesthetic. On the other hand, Jordan, who is not allergic, receives the anesthetic injection and will experience a disruption in ion movement in his cell membranes. This disruption blocks his nerve impulses, preventing him from feeling pain during the procedure until the anesthetic wears off."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Title: The worst of all Schaums guides Product review: there are several problems with using this book as self-study material:1) it is dated - though published in 1989, and by definition out of date in 2010, the first 11 chapters list many techniques that even in that period are condsidered to be of historical interest in the computer age - interpolation, collocation operators etc2) there is not a single worked example3) the solved problems make several leaps of logic - I wouldnt have got anywhere without referencing Wikipedia, Cliffs briefs on differential equations, Schuams advanced calculus etc.4) sometimes new formulas are actually introduced in worked problems - eg Everet's formula5) problems are not self contained - referencing other chapters, other problems and sometimes other problems in other chapters.In short, this book was a struggle, and although it will give you conceptualization of different techniques, it will not give you a modern or holistic perspective on the field.

The management of Rockefeller Center shifted around this time. In November 1936, John Todd was featured in two New Yorker articles that emphasized his role in the complex's construction. At the same time, Nelson was gaining clout within Rockefeller Center Inc., and he disagreed with nearly all of Todd's suggestions. Nelson's father, John, was relinquishing his responsibilities, since the Rockefeller family's youngest son David had moved out of the family home at 10 West 54th Street, and John was now focusing on his own personal life. By April 1937, Todd regretted his decision to be featured in The New Yorker. In March 1938, Nelson became the president of Rockefeller Center Inc. He then fired Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. Nelson and Robertson wanted to avoid workers' strikes, which would delay the completion of construction. Nelson, Robertson, and the workers' unions agreed to a contract in which the unions would not strike, Robertson would not lock out union workers, and both would agree to arbitration if a labor dispute arose. Rockefeller Center was one of Nelson's primary business ventures until 1958, when he was elected Governor of New York.Public relations officials were hired to advertise the different parts of the complex, such as the gardens and the plaza.

Still recovering from the civil war of 1341-1347, the emperor, with great difficulty, raised 50,000 hyperpyra from private sources for a shipbuilding program for the expected war to come. When the tariffs and custom duties were finally lowered, merchant shipping coming through the strait bypassed Genoese Galata and diverted their ships across the Golden Horn to Byzantine Constantinople. The Genoese, financially hard-hit from this policy, declared war on the Empire, and in August 1348, a flotilla of ships sailed across the Horn and attacked the Byzantine fleet; despite their large scale preparations, the Byzantine fleet was destroyed by early 1349. The Byzantines retaliated by burning wharves and warehouses along the shore and catapulted stones and burning bales of hay into Galata, setting major parts of the city on fire. After several weeks of fighting, plenipotentiaries from Genoa came and negotiated a peace agreement. The Genoese agreed to pay a war indemnity of 100,000 hyperpyra and evacuated the land behind Galata which they illegally occupied; last, they promised never to attack Constantinople.

Both sentences describe a November transaction in which the Royals acquired center fielder Coco Crisp from the Boston Red Sox, with relief pitcher Ramón Ramírez being sent to the Red Sox in return. In the first sentence, the primary focus is on the Royals acquiring Coco Crisp from the Boston Red Sox. The sentence structure is subject-verb-object, starting with \\"the Royals\\" as the subject and using \\"acquired\\" as the verb. The additional information that Coco Crisp is a center fielder and the exchange involved relief pitcher Ramón Ramírez is also included. In the second sentence, the focus shifts to Coco Crisp, and the sentence begins with \\"the Royals CF Coco Crisp\\" as the subject. The verb \\"acquired\\" is still used, but the order of the two teams is reversed, mentioning the Boston Red Sox before relief pitcher Ramón Ramírez. The fact that the exchange took place in November is still included in both sentences. In summary, while the wording and structure of the two sentences are different, they both provide the same information about a November transaction involving the Royals, CF Coco Crisp, the Boston Red Sox, and RP Ramón Ramírez."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What is the genre of the movie Movie plot title: Marnie Movie plot: The story opens as a woman with dark hair, seen only from behind, carries a suitcase along a train platform. The yellow purse tucked under her arm is presented at such an angle that it is suggestive of female genitalia.In the next scene, outraged business owner Sidney Strutt (Martin Gabel) rants to a pair of detectives that he was \\"cleaned out\\" by a female employee named Marion Holland whom he obviously hired for her looks despite her lack of professional references. A client of Strutt's, Mark Rutland (Sean Connery), overhears the conversation and says that he remembers this woman, wryly referring to her as \\"the brunette with the legs.\\"The woman, real name Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren) is a compulsive thief, and has made off with almost 10,000 stashed in the yellow purse. She changes her appearance, going from brunette to blonde, and flees with the cash, journeying south to a town in Virginia where she keeps her beloved horse, Forio, stabled. She then visits her mother Bernice (Louise Latham) in Baltimore. She lavishes her mother with expensive gifts in an attempt to impress her and win her love, but the woman is cold and distant with Marnie, showing much more maternal affection towards a little neighbor girl named Jessie whom she babysits. Marnie's intense jealousy of Jessie seems inappropriate for a grown woman to express, and along with her panic over a bouquet of red gladiolas and her mother's insistence that \\"decent\\" women don't need men, the first hints of the dysfunction that drives Marnie to lie and steal appear.Time goes by and Marnie constructs a new identity, Mary Taylor, with the intent to run her scam again on another victim. She applies for a job at a printing company in Philadelphia owned by none other than Mark Rutland. Despite her now chestnut hair, he recognizes Marnie as the woman who stole from Strutt, but, excited by the thrill of chasing and capturing the attractive criminal, he hires her. Marnie robs Rutland, too, but he anticipated this outcome and manages to track Marnie down. Instead...

Released in 1964, this film directed by Alfred Hitchcock is known for its exploration of the main character's mental state – Marnie Edgar, played by Tippi Hedren – and the suspenseful elements revolving around her actions as a compulsive thief. Throughout the plot, various themes such as crime, blackmail, complicated relationships, and deep-rooted psychological issues are intertwined, leading to a narrative that keeps the audience captivated and intrigued, which are characteristic elements of a psychological thriller. Additionally, the portrayal of complex characters as well as the exploration of their emotions, choices, and backgrounds gives the film a strong dramatic quality.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Drusilla, or Dru, is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon and David Greenwalt for the American television series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. The character is portrayed by American actress Juliet Landau. Drusilla is introduced alongside her lover Spike (James Marsters) in the second season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer to serve as new antagonists to the series' heroine, vampire Slayer Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and alongside Darla (Julie Benz) and Wolfram & Hart as the main antagonist of the second season of Angel. In contrast to the series' previous central villain, the ancient and ceremonious Master (Mark Metcalf), Spike and Dru were introduced as a more unconventional but equally dangerous pair of vampires. Actress Juliet Landau said that when she first received the script, it indicated that Drusilla's accent could be British or American. Landau felt Drusilla \\"should really be Cockney, especially with the whole Sid and Nancy analogy.\\" Though she never considered portraying Drusilla with a Southern American accent, as James Marsters had considered for Spike, she notes that invited comparisons with Blanche DuBois would also have been interesting. Drusilla's madness is exhibited in her often-strange dialogue, which is peppered with non sequiturs like \\"Spike, do you love my insides? All the parts you can't see?\\" Her behavior is girlish, accompanied by a dark, ironic twist. For instance, when she is happy, she will squeal and laugh like a young child, but she is happiest when committing torture, hunting humans, or witnessing mass destruction. She has a fondness for china dolls but keeps them blindfolded or gagged. She also loves flowers and cute animals, but is not sane enough to care for them; as she says, \\"Do you like daisies? I plant them but they always die. Everything I put in the ground withers and dies.\\" She even goes so far as to own a Pekingese puppy. She speaks in a soft, mellow voice which contrasts with her dialogue. All of \\"white hats\\" (both Scoobies and Angel's Investigations) are doubtful about how to deal with her, originally an innocent victim. Mostly and obviously Angel. Drusilla's costumes were initially intended to be a \\"cross between a Victorian period look and the Kate Moss heroin chic fashion look,\\" says Landau. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Ok, dear. So, Drusilla, or Dru, is like a character in a story, but the story is on the TV. She's in two shows, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\". Can you imagine a really bad person? That's Dru. She's not just naughty, she's a villain who loves to do mean things like hurting people or destroying stuff. You know when you play pretend, and you make up all kind of silly words? Well, Dru talks in weird, silly ways too. Imagine your favorite doll or teddy bear, now think if you covered their eyes or mouth - that's what Dru does with her dolls. Even though she likes pretty flowers and cute animals, she's not good at taking care of them, so they don't stay pretty for long. And she dresses up in really old, fancy clothes that might remind you of a princess from a really long time ago. But remember, just because Dru does bad things on TV, that doesn't mean it's okay for us to do them. This is just a story, and in real life, we should always be kind to each other, okay? Now, do you have any questions about this?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information: - The United States Naval Academy (also known as USNA, Annapolis, or simply Navy) is a four-year coeducational federal service academy in Annapolis, Maryland, United States. Established on 10 October 1845, under Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft, it is the second oldest of the United States' five service academies, and educates officers for commissioning primarily into the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps. The campus is located on the former grounds of Fort Severn at the confluence of the Severn River and Chesapeake Bay in Anne Arundel County, east of Washington, D.C. and southeast of Baltimore. The entire campus is a National Historic Landmark and home to many historic sites, buildings, and monuments. It replaced Philadelphia Naval Asylum, in Philadelphia, that served as the first United States Naval Academy from 1838 to 1845 when the Naval Academy formed in Annapolis. - Fort Severn, in present-day Annapolis, Maryland, was built in 1808 on the same site as an earlier American Revolutionary War fort of 1776. Although intended to guard Annapolis harbor from British attack, it never saw action during the War of 1812. The United States Naval Academy acquired Fort Severn and two other military bases from the United States Army on 19 October 1845. The Academy used the structure for classrooms until its demolition in 1909. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - Thomas James \`\` Tom '' Hamilton ( December 26 , 1905 -- April 3 , 1994 ) was an American football player , coach , college athletics administrator , and naval aviator who rose to the rank of rear admiral in the United States Navy . He served as the head football coach at the United States Naval Academy from 1934 to 1936 and again from 1946 to 1947 and at the University of Pittsburgh in 1951 and 1954 , compiling a career college football record of 28 -- 32 -- 1 . Hamilton was also the athletic director at the Naval Academy from 1948 to 1948 and at Pittsburgh from 1949 to 1959 . From 1959 to 1971 , he was the commissioner of the Athletic Association of Western Universities , renamed the Pacific - 8 Conference in 1968 and now known as the Pac - 12 Conference . Hamilton was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1965 . - Rear admiral is a naval commissioned officer rank above that of a commodore and captain, and below that of a vice admiral. It is generally regarded as the lowest of the \\"admiral\\" ranks, which are also sometimes referred to as \\"flag officers\\" or \\"flag ranks\\". In many navies it is referred to as a two-star rank (OF-7). - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - The University of Pittsburgh (commonly referred to as Pitt) is a state-related research university located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1787 after the American Revolutionary War, it was founded on the edge of the American frontier as the Pittsburgh Academy. It developed and was renamed as Western University of Pennsylvania by a change to its charter in 1819. After surviving two devastating fires and various relocations within the area, the school moved to its current location in the Oakland neighborhood of the city; it was renamed as the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. For most of its history, Pitt was a private institution, until 1966 when it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Graziano was the son of Ida Scinto and Nicola Barbella. Barbella, nicknamed Fighting Nick Bob, was a boxer with a brief fighting record. Born in Brooklyn, Graziano later moved to an Italian enclave centered on East 10th Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A in Manhattan's East Village. He grew up as a street fighter and learned to look after himself before he could read or write. As he grew older and seeing no other way to raise his standard of living, Graziano signed a few boxing contracts, but the rigors of training disinterested him. He and his early managers went their separate ways but eventually, he was picked up by Irving Cohen who had the sense to give him a long leash. Cohen changed the young fighter's name from Barbella to Graziano (his grandfather's surname) and lined up a fight. Refusing to train much, Graziano nevertheless showed his killer instinct and won by a knockout. Other fights were lined up with Cohen trying, in his subtle way, to overmatch Graziano, get him defeated, and thereby show him the value of getting into condition. He even demanded a match against Sugar Ray Robinson. In March 1945, at Madison Square Garden, Graziano scored a major upset over Billy Arnold, whose style was similar to that of Sugar Ray Robinson; he was a slick boxer with lightning-fast combinations and a knockout punch. The Ring magazine and various newspapers across the United States touted Arnold as the next Joe Louis or Sugar Ray Robinson. Arnold was a heavy favorite to defeat Graziano and then to go on to fight for the world title, but Graziano absorbed a beating in the early going, before going on to batter and knock Arnold out in the third round of the scheduled eight-round bout. Following his defeat to Graziano, Arnold was never the same. Graziano is most famous for his three title bouts with Tony Zale, all for the middleweight title. In their first match (September 27, 1946), after flooring Graziano in the first round, Zale took a savage beating from him, and was on the verge of losing the fight by TKO. However, he rallied and knocked him out in the sixth round to retain his title. The rematch, a year later in Chicago (July 16, 1947), was a mirror image of their first fight. The referee almost stopped the second fight in the third round because of a severe cut over Graziano's left eye, which would have awarded the victory to Zale, but Graziano's cutman, Morris (\\"Whitey\\") Bimstein, was able to stop the bleeding to let the fight continue. Graziano was battered around the ring, suffered a closed eye and appeared ready to lose by a knockout, then rallied and knocked Zale out in the sixth round, becoming world middleweight champion. Their last fight was held in New Jersey the following year (June 10, 1948). Zale regained his crown, winning the match by a knockout in the third round. The knockout blows consisted of a perfect combination of a right to Graziano's body, then a left hook to his jaw. He was knocked unconscious. His last attempt at the middleweight title came in April 1952, when he fought Sugar Ray Robinson. He dropped him to his knee with a right in the third round. Less than a minute later, Robinson knocked him out for the count with a right to the jaw. He retired after losing his very next fight, a 10-round decision to Chuck Davey.

Step 1: Combine the g terms 4721*g - 4896*g = -175*g (subtract 4896*g from 4721*g) Now, our equation is: -175*g + 3983 = -3192 Step 2: Isolate the g term To do this, we'll subtract 3983 from both sides of the equation. -175*g + 3983 - 3983 = -3192 - 3983 -175*g = -7175 (combine the constants) Step 3: Solve for g Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -175.

It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population.

While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world. - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration. - The Seaward River is a river in New Zealand 's South Island .

Many members of other rodent genera and families are also referred to as rats, and share many characteristics with true rats. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.

The medical condition glaucoma affects which part of the body?","completion":"Glaucoma is a medical condition that primarily affects the eye, specifically the optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual information from the retina to the brain. It is a group of diseases that can cause progressive damage to the optic nerve, resulting in diminished vision, and ultimately, if left untreated, blindness. The critical factor contributing to glaucoma is often an increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP). This increased pressure occurs when the fluid, called aqueous humor, which normally circulates in the front part of the eye between the cornea and the lens, builds up. The buildup is usually a result of either inadequate drainage or overproduction of the fluid. As pressure within the eye increases, it exerts unwanted stress on the optic nerve, leading to nerve damage and vision loss. There are several types of glaucoma, with the most common forms being the following: 1. Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG): This is the most prevalent form of glaucoma, characterized by a slow and almost unnoticeable increase in intraocular pressure. The drainage angle (where the aqueous humor exits the eye) appears to be open and normal, but the fluid drains too slowly. This gradual increase in eye pressure can damage the optic nerve without noticeable symptoms initially, gradually affecting peripheral vision and eventually central vision if left untreated. 2. Angle-Closure Glaucoma (ACG): A more severe and less frequent form of glaucoma, angle-closure glaucoma occurs when the drainage angle (where the aqueous humor exits the eye) becomes blocked abruptly, leading to a sudden rise in intraocular pressure. This type of glaucoma can lead to severe pain, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, and redness in the affected eye. It is considered a medical emergency and requires urgent treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. 3. Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG): In this form of glaucoma, optic nerve damage occurs with intraocular pressure within the standard range. The exact cause of normal-tension glaucoma is still unknown, although some experts believe that certain individuals might be more susceptible to optic nerve damage from regular IOP due to genetic factors or decreased blood flow. 4. Secondary Glaucoma: This type of glaucoma develops as a secondary effect of another eye-related condition or an underlying disease, such as inflammation, trauma, or a tumor. Treatment depends on addressing the primary cause along with managing the increased intraocular pressure. 5. Congenital Glaucoma: This is a rare form of glaucoma that occurs in infants and is typically inherited, resulting from congenital abnormalities in the eye's drainage system. Symptoms may include tearing, sensitivity to light, and cloudiness of the cornea. If diagnosed early, congenital glaucoma is often treatable through surgery or medication. While anyone can develop glaucoma, specific risk factors include being over 60 years old, having a family history of the condition, being of African, Hispanic, or Asian descent, having high blood pressure, diabetes, nearsightedness, or a previous eye injury. Regular eye exams with an ophthalmologist can help detect glaucoma early, and if diagnosed, appropriate therapies, such as prescription eye drops, laser treatment, or surgery, can slow or prevent further optic nerve damage and vision loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? waking coma","completion":"Based on the brief text provided for the review, \\"waking coma,\\" it is difficult to conclusively determine whether this review has a positive or negative opinion of the movie. The phrase itself can be interpreted in various ways, which makes it quite vague as a standalone comment. However, I'll attempt to explore the possible interpretations and how they could shed light on the reviewer's opinion. 1. Literal interpretation: The words \\"waking coma\\" may imply that the movie was so dull and uninteresting that it put the reviewer into a state that can be metaphorically compared to being in a coma while awake. This suggests that the movie failed to capture the reviewer's attention or provide any form of stimulation. In this case, the review would be considered negative, as it is a critique of the movie's ability to engage and entertain the viewer. 2. Thematic interpretation: Depending on the movie in question, the phrase \\"waking coma\\" might be a reference to a central theme or concept in the movie. If the movie revolves around a character in a coma or a similar situation, this could be a poignant observation highlighting the film's exploration of such themes. In this context, the review could be seen as either positive or negative, depending on how well the reviewer thinks this theme was executed in the movie. 3. Contradictory interpretation: \\"Waking coma\\" could also be interpreted as a contradiction, perhaps suggesting that while the movie had some engaging or exciting elements, it also had significant issues that left the viewer feeling unfulfilled or unable to fully invest in the story. In this case, the review would be considered mixed, with both positive and negative aspects being addressed. In conclusion, without additional context or information about the movie or the reviewer's preferences, it is difficult to categorically label the review as either positive or negative. The phrase \\"waking coma\\" itself may have been intended to be deliberately ambiguous, requiring the reader to consider the multiple possible interpretations presented above. It is important to remember that a single phrase or sentence may not be sufficient to accurately assess a reviewer's opinion, especially when the phrase is as cryptic as \\"waking coma.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis.

A marching band is a group in which instrumental musicians perform while marching, often for entertainment or competition. Instrumentation typically includes brass, woodwind, and percussion instruments. Most marching bands wear a uniform, often of a military style, that includes an associated school or organization's colors, name or symbol. Most high school marching bands, and some college marching bands, are accompanied by a color guard, a group of performers who add a visual interpretation to the music through the use of props, most often flags and rifles. Many bands have auxiliaries that add a visual component to the performance. For ceremonial bands, this could be a traditional color guard or honor guard. For drum & bugle corps and corps-style field bands, this could include Dance lines, majorettes, Auxiliary units may be collectively referred to as color guard or visual ensemble. Auxiliaries may perform as independent groups. In the early 1970s, color guards began to hold their own competitions in the winter (after the American football season, and before the beginning of the summer drum and bugle corps season). These became known as winter guard. There are also numerous dance competitions in the off-season. The color guard of a marching band or drum and bugle corps may contain sabers, mock rifles, and tall flags. In modern bands, other props are often used: flags of all sizes, horizontal banners, vertical banners, streamers, pom-poms, even tires, balls, and hula hoops or custom built props. The color guard may also employ stage dressing such as backdrops, portable flats, or other structures. These can be used simply as static scenery or moved to emphasize block drill, and are often used to create a \\"backstage\\" area to store equipment and hide personnel. While military color guards were typically male, band color guards tend to be primarily female, though it is becoming more common for men to join as well. A few independent units are all-male. Guard members nearly always wear a special uniform or costume that is distinctive from that of the band, not necessarily matching in design or color. The men's and women's guard uniforms are usually designed in one of two ways: nearly identically, but with gender-specific parts (i.e. skirts) adapted for the use of the opposite sex; or complimentarily, with the two uniforms designed similarly but with variations in color or form. The color guard uniform, especially in a high school marching band, need not be in school colors; in fact, they rarely are. These uniforms are designed to represent a certain aspect of the halftime show, characterize the guard members through costumes, or tell some sort of story, and can thus be in any design or color (a surprisingly common complaint among the high school audience is that guard uniforms and equipment \\"aren't school colors\\"). Indoor color guards have become popular within high schools and universities throughout the United States. These groups perform a theme-based show in competitions after the outdoor marching band season ends. Indoor color guard shows are typically performed in school gymnasiums and are adjudicated. Do they compete any other time of the year?","completion":"Yes, marching bands and their auxiliaries, including color guards, compete throughout the year. The competitive calendar can be divided into several segments: 1. Fall season: This is the primary season for high school marching band competitions, which typically take place from September through November. During this time, bands perform at football games and local, regional, or even national marching band competitions. Show themes often vary, and the performances showcase the band's musical and visual skills. 2. Winter season: As mentioned earlier, winter guard competitions occur between late fall and early spring, typically from December through April. Winter guard is an indoor activity in which the color guard performs theme-based shows to recorded music in school gymnasiums or other indoor venues. This season allows color guard members to continue developing their skills outside of the traditional marching band season. 3. Off-season competitions: Outside of the fall marching band and winter guard seasons, individual sections or performers within a marching band may also participate in various off-season competitions. For example, drummers may compete in solo or ensemble percussion events, while other instruments may take part in local or regional solo and ensemble festivals. These events provide musicians with additional opportunities to showcase their skills and receive expert feedback. 4. Summer season: Drum and bugle corps, which are similar to marching bands, typically perform and compete during summer months when students are on their school break. Drum and bugle corps performances are often more rigorous and advanced than high school marching bands, attracting performers from various age groups and experience levels. In the United States, Drum Corps International (DCI) is the largest competitive circuit for drum and bugle corps, hosting events from June through August across the country. In summary, there are various opportunities for marching bands and their members, including color guards, to compete and perform throughout the year. These competitive events help participating musicians hone their skills, foster camaraderie, and provide opportunities to showcase their talents to diverse audiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 1936, archaeologist Indiana Jones braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in Peru and retrieves a golden idol. He is confronted by rival archaeologist RenÃ© Belloq and the indigenous Hovito people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Indy surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting floatplane. Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant; the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra is the key to finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried. The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to the bar to fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.

How to prevent tear staining in dogs Understand tear stains. Tears contain a chemical called porphyrin that turns rust-colored when exposed to the air. A process called oxidation causes an eventual color stain to a dog's fur. Available choices: (a). This color is then absorbed through the coat, leaving behind no visible need to repair. Overnight stains are considered a fair sign and your dog may be able to fight eye infection.. (b). Watch out for extreme tear stains, whether they're flare stains, extensive grime on the skin, or areas that are not porphyrin resistant. Pure oxidation relies heavily on the presence of nitrates in the skin so that eventually the stain will disappear.. (c). Just like hair dye, it takes a while for the porphyrin to stain fur. Tear staining is a result of tears not being wiped away before the fur gets stained.. (d). Though stain removal is quick and easy, it costs significantly more than professional bleaching to stop the stain. The chemical can remove minor stains, acidic stains, and others, but it can generally not be removed in a single stroke..","completion":"Tear staining in dogs can be unsightly and, if left untreated, may lead to more serious issues.

Somewhat of a specialist regarding American terrorism and due to teach a class on terrorism at the university, Michael starts to become suspicious of his new suburban neighbors, Oliver (Tim Robbins) and Cheryl Lang (Joan Cusack), whom he's just met after taking their son, Brady (Mason Gamble), to the emergency room following a reported fireworks accident.At first his suspicions are based on little things such as Oliver's architectural blueprints that seem to be for something other than the shopping mall he claims he's building, as well as pieces of mail that contradict where Oliver said he attended college. Neither his girlfriend and former student, Brooke Wolfe (Hope Davis), nor his wife's former FBI partner, Whit Carver (Robert Gossett), believe any of his wild theories.After doing some digging, Michael discovers that Oliver's real name is William Fenimore, and that he built a pipe bomb and used it to try to blow up a postal office in Kansas when he was 16. William/Oliver confronts Michael over his looking into William's past. He reveals that 'Oliver Lang' is the name of his friend, who died in a hunting accident. William's family had owned a farm but it went broke because the government 'appropriated' the river that ran through it 'for other uses'. As a result the crops died and they could not raise any animals. William's dad then killed himself and made it look like a tractor accident so the family could claim the life insurance. He left a note for William explaining everything. He built the pipe bomb to get back at the government. When William's friend Oliver died he took his name the next day to hide his past.

In Thunderbirds what was the unnamed villain known as?","completion":"In the original 1965-1966 television series Thunderbirds, the unnamed villain who constantly threatens the International Rescue organization and its heroic pilots is commonly referred to as \\"The Hood.\\" This mysterious character was created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, the masterminds behind the show and its groundbreaking use of marionette puppets and scale models, which they called \\"Supermarionation.\\" The Hood is portrayed as a master criminal with a penchant for sabotage, espionage, and acts of terrorism. His primary motivation is to acquire the secrets of International Rescue's advanced technology for his own nefarious purposes. He is highly skilled in various fields, including disguise, telepathy, and even advanced knowledge of electronics and engineering. As an international criminal, The Hood is relentless in his pursuit of the Thunderbirds and their top-secret technology. He is the half-brother of Kyrano, the housekeeper of Tracy Island (International Rescue's secret base), which further complicates matters. The Hood exploits his familial connection to Kyrano through telepathic control and coercion to get unauthorized access to the island and gather sensitive information. This familial link also adds depth to The Hood's characterization and highlights the show's exploration of the complex nature of the villain-hero relationship. Despite his intelligence and cunning, The Hood is repeatedly defeated by the International Rescue team, with the show's protagonists—Jeff Tracy and his five sons at the helm of technologically advanced rescue vehicles known as Thunderbirds—often saving the day. Throughout the series, The Hood features prominently in several episodes, such as \\"Trapped in the Sky,\\" \\"Edge of Impact,\\" \\"Desperate Intruder,\\" and \\"Mission to the Unknown,\\" among others. In these storylines, his schemes range from sabotaging aircraft to trying to steal nuclear secrets, always to be foiled by the Thunderbirds team. In later iterations and adaptations of the show, including the 2004 live-action film Thunderbirds, The Hood continued to be a prominent villain. Still, his character and motivation have evolved from the original series. In the 2004 film, he is portrayed by actor Ben Kingsley, and his backstory is expanded to highlight his motivation for vengeance against International Rescue due to past failures. In conclusion, the unnamed villain in the Thunderbirds series is widely known as \\"The Hood,\\" a master criminal with intricate connections to the heroes he opposes. The character serves both as a persistent antagonist and as a complex figure whose relationships and motivations are explored throughout the series and its adaptations. His constant pursuit of International Rescue and the Thunderbirds highlights not only his own cunning and determination but also the heroism and resourcefulness of the central characters, making him an indispensable part of the ever-popular Thunderbirds narrative."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given the question: I have a new situation: The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there. But I can use this background: While the Grants were on the Galápagos, a drought occurred. As a result, fewer seeds were available for finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could crack open and eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks could crack and eat seeds of all sizes. As a result, many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. Birds with bigger beaks survived and reproduced (see Figure below ). Within 2 years, the average beak size in the finch population increased. Evolution by natural selection had occurred. What is an answer for this question: Which island had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds? The answer is:","completion":"Island 1 had fewer small-beaked birds that could only crack open smaller seeds. This is because Island 1 experienced a drought in recent years, which resulted in fewer seeds being available for the finches to eat. Due to this scarcity of food, birds with smaller beaks that could only eat smaller seeds faced more competition and difficulty in finding enough food to survive. Conversely, birds with larger beaks that could crack and eat seeds of all sizes were at an advantage during this time since they had access to a wider variety of food sources. As a result, many small-beaked birds died during the drought, leading to a decrease in their population on Island 1. Meanwhile, birds with larger beaks had higher survival and reproduction rates, causing an increase in their population and an overall increase in the average beak size among the finches on Island 1. This is an example of evolution by natural selection, where the traits best suited to the environment (in this case, large beaks) become more prevalent in the population."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their blowout win over the Eagles, the Broncos traveled to Arlington, Texas, for an interconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. The Cowboys grabbed a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tony Romo to wide receiver Dez Bryant, followed by running back DeMarco Murray rushing for a 4-yard touchdown. The latter score occurred after a fumble by Broncos' wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos later got on the scoreboard, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 4-yard shovel pass to tight end Julius Thomas for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, a 43-yard field goal by placekicker Dan Bailey gave the Cowboys a 17-7 lead. The Broncos then reeled off 21 unanswered points, with Manning adding two more touchdown passes &#8212; a 2-yarder to Decker and a 9-yarder to Thomas, followed by Manning rushing for a 1-yard touchdown on a bootleg play. A 48-yard field goal by Bailey at the end of the first half narrowed the Broncos' lead to 28-20. The Broncos added to their lead midway through the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wes Welker. However, the Cowboys subsequently began chipping away at the Broncos' lead, with Romo connecting on an 82-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrance Williams. A 48-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos a 38-27 lead, but the Cowboys further narrowed the Broncos' lead, with a 2-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Bryant (with an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt). On the Broncos' next possession, Manning threw his first interception of the season, and the Cowboys subsequently re-claimed the lead early in the fourth quarter, with Romo throwing a 10-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten, coupled with a two-point pass from Romo to Williams. The Broncos tied the game at 41-41 on their next possession, with a 50-yard field goal by Prater, however, on the Cowboys' next possession, Romo connected on a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cole Beasley to give the Cowboys a 48-41 lead with 7:19 remaining in the fourth quarter. Manning subsequently led the Broncos on a 9-play, 73-yard drive, which culminated with running back Knowshon Moreno rushing for a 1-yard touchdown to tie the game at 48-48 with 2:24 remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays into the Cowboys' next possession, as the Cowboys were attempting a game-winning drive, Romo was intercepted by Broncos' linebacker Danny Trevathan at the Cowboys' 24-yard line just before the two-minute warning. On the fourth play of the Broncos' final possession, the Broncos were facing a 3rd-and-1 at the Cowboys' 2-yard line, after the Cowboys had exhausted two of their three team timeouts. Moreno earned a crucial first down after Manning implored him to go down before reaching the goal line instead of scoring a touchdown, which forced the Cowboys to burn their final timeout with 1:35 remaining in the fourth quarter. After three kneel-downs by Manning, Prater nailed the game-winning 28-yard field goal as time expired. This was the only game during the 2013 season in which the Broncos wore their alternate navy blue jerseys.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where did an interagency group travel to in 1999 and 2000 to find out about Bin Laden's finances?\\" is \\"Russia\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Where did an interagency group travel to in 1999 and 2000 to find out about Bin Laden's finances?\\" is not \\"Russia\\". The correct answer is \\"Saudi Arabia\\". The paragraph mentions that the U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of Bin Laden's finances. The mention of Russia in the paragraph refers to a large-scale money laundering scandal involving the Bank of New York, which is not directly related to Bin Laden's finances."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},D={key:0,class:"empty-state"},q=["disabled"],E={key:0},j={key:1};function R(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=g("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(p,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",D,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
